Click here to read about the tragedy that made national news and changed the Lopes Family forever.This GoFundMe campaign was created on behalf of and with the consent of Olivia and Alex Lopes for their son, LJ. Olivia is a Physical Education teacher at William Annin Middle School and coaches both Girls Basketball and Girls Lacrosse at Ridge High School. Alex is the Offensive Coordinator of the Men’s Lacrosse Team at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. They are both incredibly dedicated to their students and athletes and are committed members of the Basking Ridge, Glen Ridge, Keyport and Kean University communities.Everything changed on Tuesday, January 8th.LJ was struck by a vehicle, along with his grandmother (59 years old) and cousin (4 years old). All three were walking home after picking LJ’s cousin up from preschool, when a vehicle jumped the curb and hit them from behind. LJ’s grandmother suffered two broken legs, a broken tailbone, and facial reconstructive surgery. His cousin suffered a broken femur, arm and jaw; both are now recovering in rehabilitation facilities. Tragically, LJ (only eight months old), was the most vulnerable and suffered the most extensive and life threatening injuries. His car seat was thrown from the stroller upon impact and recovered from nearby bushes with LJ still strapped into his car seat. He is currently fighting through multiple skull fractures, orbital fractures, severe brain trauma, and a broken leg and is currently having difficulty moving his right arm. LJ remains in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit with extensive injuries and requires around the clock care and treatment. While Alex has had to return to work, Olivia has not left LJ’s side. The Lopes Family has a difficult road ahead and needs our support. It is often in times like these that the best of communities are often revealed. Team Lopes needs your help! LJ has a long road ahead of him and may need to access expensive medical resources. Together we can show the Lopes Family that we have their back and we are here to support them through this difficult time. These funds will be used for medical and related expenses for LJ and family if and when they arise.Read more"

  I'm just going to take a minute and explain this past year of our life.As most of you know Chris was born with a heart defect that will end in him having aheart transplant.

We were doing really well, enjoyed being out, hanging out with friends singing our hearts out. Karaoke was our lives! Then Covid hit, we were strongly advised right away by Chris's cardiologist to stay home. We were told that because of Chris's health if he was to catch covid it would be very likely he would not make it. Chris immediately stopped Karaoke and I immediately asked my work for an open ended leave.We tried to make due with what we were given, bills were just barely getting paid every month, but we were still happy to have each other and the kids. Hopeful that this covid crap would be over soon so we could get back to normal every day life.

   On January 19th, 2021 it was like any other day. We woke up early and sent the kids to school, enjoyed our 2 cups of morning coffee and our daily catchup on youtube. We had a quiet, relaxing day. Later in the afternoon, Chris was acting weird. Autumn (our 6 year old) asked him to turn her wifi back on her tablet which needed to be done through an app on his phone. He kept searching through his playstation for the app to turn her wifi on again. Opening and closing games on his playstation, shutting it down and turning it back on again. His only response to questions was ""YUP"" I knew something was off, so I called an ambulance.The paramedics were convinced he was suffering from a stroke.After what seemed like forever he finally agreed to go to the hospital and get checked out. By the end of the day he had received a CT scan and we were told that he did indeed have a brain bleed (stroke).

  After a few days of Chris being in the hospital he was feeling much better from the stroke, he was told by the neurologist that if he (neurologist) didn't see the damage on the CT Scan he never would have known that Chris had a stroke. We were so thankful that there was no damage done. The neurologist said that Chris would have to stop taking his blood thinners or it could cause another stroke.

  Then came in a group of people we never met yet. They introduced themselves as the Infectious Desease Team. They explained to us that at some point, unsure when, Chris had developed a bacteria in his blood. This bacteria could potentially form a vegetation on his pacemaker and make life alot harder for us. Chris underwent a 3D ultrasound and the results came back that he did indeed have vegetation on the wire of his pacemaker. We were told that he would need to be on a potent antibiotic to attack this vegetation for at least 6 weeks and have surgery.

   Because of Chris's heart condition any infection is super serious, they wanted to do a surgery to remove the pacemaker and the infection, but in order for Chris to survive the operation he would need to be on his blood thinners, which he could not take at this current time. At this point no one knew what the right thing to do was. His cardiologist was working with the neurologist, the infectious desease team and the transplant team to try and figure out what was the best thing to do. It even came to the point that he called an emergency zoom meeting with other high end cardiologist from across the country to get more input. They came to the conclusion that Chris's would be on the potent antibiotic for 12 weeks and then they would reassess then. He is currently home, on an IV picc line feeding him this antibiotic directly to his heart. After his 12 weeks of treatment we will have a bill for over $1000, this is for the antibiotics and supplies.Chris has gone through a ton of test, and the conclusion is that his heart muscle is weakening. The next step potentially can be a VAD (artificial pump) put in to bridge the gap between now and heart transplant time, or just full blown heart transplant. They are preparing him for whatever comes next. Over the next couple months we will be back and forth to the University of Alberta going through cardiac rehab appointments.



***For those who don't know the seriousness of a heart transplant. Chris's chest cavity will have to be crushed for them to take out his current heart and put in the new one. He will then be put in a 10-13 day induced coma, where he will be on a breathing machine and a machine to make the new heart pump for him and keep a steady heartrate. When they finally take him out of the induced coma, he will not be allowed to eat for the next 5 days, IV fluids only in that time. Then comes the rehabilitation process. Chris will have to stay in the hospital for 3 months. 3 whole months where he has to live in a hospital bed. 3 months of me driving back and forth everyday being his support person. Paying for parking at the hospital isn't cheap, and then supplying the gas to get there everyday. I will not be able to work at all during this time.



After his 3 months of rehabilitation he will get to come home. I will need continue to stay home with him for the next 10-12 weeks to be his caregiver. Chris will have to be on a lot of prescription medications to help his body accept his new heart, some of these medications are not covered under my health benefits. One medication is $1500 a month! Thats a mortgage payment, and this is a medication that Chris needs in order to live!



It will be a long road, but we will keep pushing to get to that light at the end of it.Covid has been really tough, and now with Chris's heart getting worse I won't be able to go back to work any time soon. So here is our ask for help, even if you can donate $1. We would appreciate any help even if its just a share on Facebook. Thank you for taking the time to listen to Chris's story.

Dalton “caught an edge,” ripping the ski off his boot, causing him to lose control and crash headfirst into a tree. His habit of wearing a helmet saved his life.Dalton was knocked unconscious for approximately one minute before his friend came to his assistance and called for help. The ski patrol arrived on the scene and strapped him onto a toboggan to safely remove him from the mountain terrain. He was then life-flighted from Glenwood Springs to Grand Junction, where he would receive the medical care required for his head, neck, and back injuries.Dalton sustained severe injuries to his vertebral column, including six (6) trans fractions and one (1) versed fraction to his vertebra. His T12 vertebra was fully fractured, and he had a rib fracture and neck injuries. Thankfully, the CT scan showed no head trauma, and his organs were functioning properly. The neurosurgeon at St. Mary’s in Grand Junction performed a three-hour Percutaneous Lumbar Fusion the following day to fuse Dalton’s T10 to L2 vertebra. His mom flew from Ohio to comfort and be with him as he adjusted to his new reality while friends and family showed their love and support by text and calls-they were incredible!The surgery was a success, and Dalton started to work on his PT and OT post-surgery on the 9th floor of the hospital. Everyone was encouraged and appreciative of his inner strength and positive attitude. The care and compassion he received from the dedicated professionals at St. Mary’s will never be forgotten.The journey of healing from an accident of this nature is both physical and spiritual. His progress will be an upward trajectory that will necessitate extensive physical therapy and rehabilitation over and beyond his surgery and time spent in the hospital. Dalton is in need of financial assistance for his life flight, surgery, premiums, copays, deductibles, therapy, out-of-pocket, and living expenses during these challenging circumstances when he is unable to work.Dalton is living one day at a time with the hope of returning to what he loves most-skiing and working with his friends at Aspen Ski Company and Chili’s in Glenwood Springs.Forever humble and grateful for your support to assist with this financial burden to help Dalton to focus on his recovery and life-altering hardship.Posted on behalf of Kelli Hill, Dalton's mom.Read more"

A dog owners worst nightmare!This is John's story...A neighbor knocked at our door at 7:30 and said to us”your dog was just run over on Winnetka Ave. My heart dropped and I thought I would throw up. Roxanne and her 15 month old son, they live with me, drove to see Dottie. I saw her lying in the street surrounded by maybe six people kneeling beside her and petting her and talking to her, they brought blankets and towels for her to lay on. We were in shock!We drove Dottie to McClave Veterinary a 24 hr emergency Vet. Dottie was in shock and not moving. (she had run across the street and ran into the side of a fast moving car. The driver stopped and went back.)At McClave she received IV, X-rays and all other emergency measures. She spent 2 nights there and then we took her to Valley Specialist of the Valley in Woodland Hills. They have a Neurologist on staff. She received an MRI and all kinds of tests. She spent two nights there at over $500.00a night. The Neurologist said we should take Dottie back to McClave because they can now do what they are doing which is physical therapy every 4 hours, etc. She has been there ever since . Dottie has a TBI (traumatic brain injury).Bruising and bleeding in the spinal cord. They say it is a blood clot in her spine which is causing the problems and that it is like a stroke in terms of recovery possibilities and it will take time time time! Her right front leg is suspected to be possible torn nerves. Through it all she has made small amounts of progress every day and her prognosis ispositive.John says....We want nothing more than to have her home!

Adrian has attained the goal of walking in the walking machine at Neuro-Concepts for 30 minutes and has gained more strength through his trunk. Adrian attended a clinic to have him sized for a custom chair that should be ready in a couple of months. A current focus for Adrian is communication. Under the direction of the SLP Adrian is working towards giving clear signals for “YES” and “NO”. He is progressing well giving a thumbs up for yes, and is working hard at thumbs down for no. Thumbs down is significantly harder, but he is showing improvement. Moving to a rehabilitation facility is the goal and this style of communication is a key requirement. His middle finger has been getting more exercise lately as he has been communicating frustration this way when he is aggravated or bothered. Adrian has also received his second Pfizer vaccine. He was not himself for about a week, but it is natural for people to feel unwell after. This is a sign of the body developing antibodies.Thank you to everyone for your continued support and messages of encouragement. Please continue to share their story. #MacBlueNeedsYouUPDATE: Adrian’s rehabilitation has been going well. He is still receiving physio 5 days per week and is travelling to Neuro Concepts for two of those appointments. Transport has been going well in his broda chair and he is now walking 25 minutes on the walking machine, building up to 30 minutes. The speech language pathologist is also meeting regularly and with help from the SLP at Maimonidies Adrian is slowly working on swallowing. With the use of a wonderful app, Adrian is starting to develop his communication by pressing YES or NO on the iPad and identifying pictures of family and friends (and their pets!). Adrian has been showing a lot more emotion. Both happiness and agitation. This is all a good sign. He is also showing us two fingers, thumbs up and even the middle finger to show dislike.The Mealtrain is still continuing for the month of March.

Please continue to share their story #MacBlueNeedsYouUPDATE: Adrian has remained medically stable since his return from the Jewish General Hospital last month. Since he has been back at Maimonidies, he has been receiving physio therapy Monday-Friday from the team at Neuro-Concepts. Adrian has been working hard on his strength. Adrian’s head control has been improving daily and he is now working on standing. Cassy and the physiotherapist support Adrian in a standing position. Everyday he has been able to extend his time in a standing position. Adrian had his first outing on February 4th. Cassy accompanied him to the Neuro-Concepts facility where he used their walking machine for the first time. The innovative system allows Adrian to walk in a controlled fashion while having his entire body safely supported. Adrian did well on his first visit and the team hopes to plan weekly visits for Adrian, increasing to two visits a week.The speech language pathologist has now officially joined Adrian’s rehab team and will be working with Cassy and Adrian regularly. Adrian has been exploring his emotions. He is smiling more often and laughed for the first time. Due to COVID-19 Montreal has recently enforced some very strict regulations. The city has had an 8pm curfew for the last 3 weeks, and the curfew has been extended with no official review date. As a result, tighter visitation is being enforced at Maimonidies. Only 2 caregivers are permitted, 1 every 24 hours. Cassy is there very long hours and Adrian’s mom is the second caregiver.Thank you to everyone who has been supporting Cassy and Adrian. Caring for their animals during Cassy’s long days, rides to Maimonidies and meals for Cassy. The Mealtrain is still active for the month of February.

Please continue to share their story #MacBlueNeedsYouUPDATE: Happy New Year everyone. With a new year came new challenges, but Adrian and Cassy are all about perseverance. The weekend leading up to the new year Adrian wasn’t quite right, his heart rate was elevated again and had a very upset stomach for a few days (you know what that means!). Things were not getting any better and he became lethargic. On December 31st Adrian was taken to emergency at The Jewish General Hospital. Fortunately, Cassy was able to stay with him in emergency. This proved to be the best trip to the hospital, if you can say that about a hospital stay. The doctors did the most thorough work up including blood work, X-rays and CT scans. They ruled out COVID complications, heart concerns, pneumonia and lung disease. Adrian was severely dehydrated with elevated sodium levels. After a couple of days in emergency, they admitted him for further observation. During his stay they were able to re-hydrate Adrian, which brought his heart rate down and over a few days lowered his sodium levels. Adrian was much more alert and was quite vocal. He was even humming along when Cassy sang to him. Cassy was able to meet with their nutritionist who recommended a change in Adrian’s feeding routine. He is still fed through a PEG, but now he is receiving his feeds 3 times a day as meals, at a faster rate so he is able to get all of his nutrition without it being continuous through the day.Adrian returned to his room at Maimonidies on January 7th and physio has started back up. He will be getting physio from the team at Neuro-Concepts 5 days per week. The Speech Language Pathologist will be brought in at the end of the month.Thank you to everyone who helped out while Cassy stayed at the hospital with Adrian. Thank you to everyone who has been sending meals through Meal Train (go to https://www.mealtrain.com/trains/wk828e if you would like to send a meal) and to everyone who has contributed to the GoFundMe. Your generosity is so much appreciated! Please continue to share their story. #MacBlueNeedsYouUPDATE: Adrian has finally had two straight weeks in his room at Maimonidies without any trips to the hospital. He is becoming more comfortable in his new surroundings and as a result, his vitals have been stable, and he seems less stressed. Adrian’s elevated heart rate has stabilized. After consulting with the nutritionist, Adrian started on a new feed which is known to be more easily digested. This will help control his digestion concerns (which may have also contributed to his elevated heart rate). Adrian has been much more alert and bright eyed this past week. He has had regular physiotherapy with the team from Neuro-Concepts and they have noticed that Adrian has shown improvements in his strength over just a short period of time. A Speech Language Pathologist will be joining the team soon. It has been challenging to find a SLP that will meet in person. Adrian was one of the lucky ones to receive the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine last week. He tolerated the first dose well, with no immediate reaction and no side effects.Please keep sending you messages and positive thoughts and continue to share their story. The holidays will be hard and they need all of your support. #MacBlueNeedsYouUPDATE: On November 12th Adrian moved to Maimonidies, a long-term care facility in Montreal. It was time for Adrian to move on from the hospital. From the hospital there are two possible paths: A rehab facility or long-term care. Unfortunately, Adrian is not yet ready to actively participate in rehab and therefore is not a candidate for a rehab facility. The move has been challenging and heartbreaking for Adrian, Cassy & family. After a week of advocating to get Adrian’s schedule re-established, the team at Maimonidies was finally on board with his schedule. On November 20th Adrian had an assessment with a private physiotherapist from Neuro-Concepts (an organization of specialists that specialize in TBI rehabilitation). Just as Adrian’s new physio schedule was being established, the following day his COVID test came back positive :( Adrian was moved to the hot zone at Maimonidies for his (minimum) 10 day isolation period. This was a shock to all as Adrian was and remained asymptomatic. All family members and the physiotherapist tested negative. On November 28th the doctor at Maimonidies became concerned that Adrian’s heart rate was high and sent Adrian to the hospital. The hospital did blood work and ran many tests. Fortunately, there was nothing alarming and Adrian was brought back to Maimonidies that day. Adrian’s second COVID test came back negative and he was able to return to his room on November 30th.This was a lot of moving around for Adrian. Due to the severity of his TBI it takes him a few days to become aware and comfortable in his surroundings. Now that he is back in his room, he is able to resume his schedule based on the recommendations from his assessment, with the private team from Neuro-Concepts. Adrian’s new physiotherapist from Neuro-Concepts started December 3rd. A nutritionist and speech language pathologist will also be joining the team. They will be working together with the Maimonidies staff to encourage Adrian’s progress moving forward. Thank you again for all of your positive thoughts and messages. Adrian is so lucky to have so many cheerleaders. Your donations are greatly appreciated. This fund will be important now more than ever as the private team of TBI specialists are costly and insurance offers very limited coverage.Please donate if you can and continue to share. #MacBlueNeedsYouUPDATE: The last couple of weeks have been very emotional. October was hard, full of anniversaries and special memories that Cassy and Adrian share. The day they met, their first date, first kiss and Adrian’s epic proposal on Halloween.A meeting was held with family and Adrian’s team at Montreal General Hospital to discuss the next steps in Adrian’s care. Adrian is medically stable and no longer requires hospitalization. Unfortunately, Adrian is still not able to actively participate in intense rehab. Adrian can communicate when he is uncomfortable through his breathing patterns and movements but is not yet showing clear, consistent communication that would make him a candidate for a rehab facility. What happens next? Adrian will be moving to a long-term care facility. This is not the news we were hoping to report 3 months post-accident.  Care facilities are being researched for Adrian to continue his physio and speech therapies. Additional therapists will be brought in to assist with Adrian’s hopeful path to recovery. The coming days and weeks will be extremely difficult. Please continue to share their love story. #MacBlueNeedsYouUPDATE: Adrian's tracheostomy has been removed and is healing well. The day after it was removed, he has a scare and was rushed back to the ICU. This was a 24 hour visit, his breathing became very fast. Fortunately, they were able to get it under control and Adrian returned to his room on the TBI floor at Montreal General Hospital the next morning. He is now considered medically stable. As we approach 3 months post -accident (October 30th), Adrian is still in the emerging consciousness state, he is awake during the day with his eyes open but is still unable to communicate. It is uncertain if he is aware of his surroundings. Adrian is doing a small amount of vocalizing (Ahhh sounds) and moving his arms and legs. Cassy and the therapy team are working with Adrian daily with the hope that he will emerge and start communicating. Right now, small goals are in place to assess Adrian’s progress. Cassy completed her neurological exam this week. Her concussion is healed but the trauma of the accident along with the emotional distress of missing Adrian is weighing on her heavily.Everyday life just isn’t the same for these newlyweds. Thank you to all of their friends who have been tremendous emotional support and thank you to everyone who has donated. Please continue to share their story. #MacBlueNeedsYouUPDATE: Adrian has slowly graduated from using a speaking valve in his tracheostomy for 3 hours each day to having a cork in for 12 hrs per day. While he is breathing well through his nose and mouth, this has been exhausting for Adrian. He has also been working on a tilt table at various degrees. The tilt table mobilizes to a vertical position and helps with awareness, among other things. Adrian started taking a medication for wakefulness over the past week and we are still waiting to see its full effects. Adrian has been making progress since moving to the TBI floor at Montreal General Hospital, but this week was different. There was little progress this week for unknown reasons. It’s been a hard week for both Cassy and Adrian. Montreal entered the red zone due to the rising number of Covid cases in the Montreal area which adds extra stresses. Your positive thoughts, prayers and messages are needed now more than ever. They help Cassy get through each day. She continues to work with Adrian every day. With the help of friends, Cassy printed of pictures of Adrian with friends & family to collage his hospital room door. The team knows how loved he is, not only by Cassy but by so many. Please continue to share. #MacBlueNeedsYouUPDATE: Adrian is still on the TBI floor at Montreal General Hospital. Last week Adrian's team of doctors and therapists had a meeting with Adrian's family. Adrian's neurologist noted that over a short time working with the rehab team, she was happy with the progress she had observed. He is currently following direction, though still not consistently. The team confirmed that Adrian is much more responsive to Cassy's voice. Their love for one another shines through. Cassy continues to work with Adrian everyday alongside his team. Adrian will be closely monitored over the coming weeks to assess next steps. Please continue to share their story #MacBlueNeedsYouUPDATE: Adrian is now on the TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) floor at Montreal General Hospital. The team of rehab specialists began working with him on September 8th. The team works with Adrian Monday through Friday. Cassy has been shown the various exercises and continues to work with Adrian over the weekend. Adrian has slowly begun to follow Cassy's voice, moving his legs and squeezing her hand, though not always consistently. His neck collar was removed on September 11th, after 6 weeks. Thank you again for all your support. Please continue to send positive messages and share their story. This is just the beginning. Adrian and Cassy need you. XOUPDATE: Adrian & Cassy arrived safely in Montreal the morning of August 29th via air ambulance. Adrian is now in the ICU at Montreal General Hospital. He remains unconscious. Adrian is breathing on his own, with the aid of an oxygen mask. The next step will be to move to the TBI floor at Montreal General. This is just the beginning of Adrian's road to a hopeful recovery. Please continue to send your positive thoughts and share this page. #MacBlueNeedsYouUPDATE: It has been three weeks since the accident occurred. Adrian remains unconscious. Adrian has taken some small steps in the right direction, responding when stimulated and tracking Cassy’s voice at times. The doctors remain hopeful that he will be able to wake soon. Patience is our friend at the moment. We are all missing Adrian’s jovial personality, infectious laugh and zest for life. No one more than Cassy. Cassy remains in Kamloops by Adrian’s side while family and friends visit for support. Thank you to everyone who has donated, sent words of encouragement and prayers. Please continue to share this page. This is going to be a marathon and Adrian needs you.With Cassy by his side, Adrian is fighting for his life on the opposite end of the country away from family and friends. Newlyweds Cassandra and Adrian MacDonald married on a gorgeous whimsical day last August. They planned their honeymoon for the summer of 2020, but due to COVID-19 their plans were postponed. Adrian had the summer off from school and Cassy was working from home. They decided to make the best of their summer and purchased a campervan so they could travel. Together with their two dogs, Dexter & Daphne, they started their road trip. They set out to Cassy’s family cabin in Winnipeg Beach, MB where they spent over a month enjoying living by the lake. On July 24th Cassy & Adrian got back into the campervan to continue their travels west, making stops to visit more family and friends, with plans to be back in Montreal around their first anniversary on August 17th. The evening of July 30th in Clearwater BC, they began what was supposed to be one of the last legs of their trip west, but sadly did not make it far. They were driving on the highway when the brakes failed, losing control of the van and the van rolled. Cassy experienced a concussion and required stitches in her arm & head, physically she will be okay. Adrian was thrown from the van, resulting in head trauma and a fractured neck. Adrian was taken by ambulance to the Royal Inland Hospital in Kamloops, BC. He is being cared for and monitored closely in the intensive care unit. Adrian has not woken; he is unresponsive and requires a respirator. It is too soon to give more details on Adrian’s condition. We hope to be able to share news of progress as we learn more. What is known is this will be a long road for the couple. Being so far from home adds more stresses and complications to an already difficult situation.This fund has been set-up to assist the newlyweds with expenses associated with being hospitalized out of the province, lost wages, travel home and rehabilitation costs. Cassandra is currently on leave from work while she remains in Kamloops by Adrian’s side. #MacBlueNeedsYouRead more"

She was cross-checked by the opponent causing her to slam her head on the ice. As days and ultimately months went on, Drew’s condition continued to worsen due to this brain and neck injury. It was determined that this was a severe concussion.It is about one year later now and Drew continues to experience weekly migraines, insomnia, tinnitus, sensitivity to light, inability to focus her eyes, dizziness, blurry/double vision, neck pain, racing heart and fatigue. She has suffered from post-concussion syndrome, convergence insufficiency, and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, among many other diagnoses. She began ongoing physical therapy, vestibular and vision rehab to help her improve.Prior to this injury, Drew led a very active lifestyle and worked as a physician assistant in the emergency department at the Cleveland Clinic. She loved to be active, playing various sports and exercise was a big part of her life. She loved to read books and continue to learn and improve as a provider in the medical field. Since Drew’s injury, she has been unable to work. It is unknown if she will ever be able to return to such an environment. She is also unable to perform normal day-to-day tasks such as exercise, use the computer or watch television. She has limited phone use. She is unable to exert herself or multi-task. She is only able to read in five-minute increments while tracking one line at a time. She is also unable to drive and even riding in the car is taxing due to the movement.Drew has seen many specialists in this process. Drew’s treatment plan has included weekly physical therapy sessions, biweekly chiropractic adjustments, vision therapy and vestibular rehabilitation. She averages five appointments per week. She has tried numerous medications to provide some relief of her symptoms. In March, Drew traveled to Georgia where she received 8-hour daily neuro-rehabilitation. Through this rehab program it was found that Drew’s eyes are not working together to focus on a single target, are unable to track moving objects and other areas of her brain were not firing properly. Drew was assigned a home exercise program to re-train her eyes and brain which she performs with the help of my husband and I. While she did have some improvements with this program, she still had a long way to go.Drew experienced a setback in her recovery in June. She had undergone dry needling therapy to help relieve some of her symptoms and unfortunately ended up hospitalized with a pneumothorax. Despite this setback, she has continued to fight through the recovery. She began a new vision rehabilitation program and just recently completed her first ten weeks. It was again determined that Drew’s eyes continue to operate independently of each other, she has a deficit in visual processing, and has deficiencies in the muscular function of the eyes. After a recent progress exam it was determined that though she had made some improvements she will require at minimum another ten more weeks.While the physical symptoms are difficult to navigate for Drew, she struggles mentally and emotionally. She has not been able to live her normal life and has struggled with being isolated from work, friends and family. It is not an easy task for Drew to interact in “normal” environments (restaurants, grocery stores, etc.) due to her inability to withstand light, movement and crowded spaces.Though Drew’s friends, family and community have extended themselves to create an environment of healing we hope that continued therapy will allow Drew to fully recover and get back to some sort of normalcy. To reach that end, Drew is struggling financially to provide herself with the tools to meet her goals of recovery. Drew’s physical therapy, chiropractic, vision rehabilitation and doctor’s visits will be needed long term much beyond anyone’s initial expectations. Drew’s physical therapy visits are no longer covered by insurance as she has exceeded the annual amount covered and therefore physical therapy is out of pocket. To date, Drew’s out of pocket medical bills total over $12,000.We have struggled with the thought of receiving assistance from others to provide for Drew, but are realistic that she will not get what she needs if other options are not explored. As she still requires long-term treatment to give her the best possible outcome, please consider supporting Drew on her quest to a full recovery.It was recommended that Drew receive treatment in Canada at MMTR Physiotherapy. This is a research-based clinic in Ontario that was developed to treat concussions and aims to address and treat the underlying problem. We believe this would allow Drew to be one step closer to normalcy. This treatment protocol would require Drew to stay in Ontario for two weeks and the cost is $4,382 plus travel and housing accommodations. Our goal is to raise funds to allow Drew to receive this treatment and help offset costs to continue physical therapy, chiropractic visits and vision rehabilitation.This page was created in hopes of easing Drew’s financial burden from substantial and ongoing medical bills during this difficult time and allow her the opportunity to recover. We appreciate and are very grateful for any donation you are willing to offer. Every little bit helps. Please know that even if you are unable to donate, sharing is a wonderful way to support!Read more"

He remained in their care for four months, receiving physical therapy treatment for five hours each day.Most recently, Liam attended physical therapy sessions at Push to Walk, where my brother Logan works as a trainer's aide.At 25 years old, Liam found himself trying to relearn how to walk. He began the rehabilitation process without any sensation and slowly regained feeling and small range of motion in his legs.

He is strong-willed and focused.Despite the incredible progress he has made, Liam continues to struggle with strength and controlling the spasticity in his legs. These factors have inhibited his ability to make a full recovery thus far.In the coming month, Liam will be receiving neurological reengineering treatment from the Barwis Center in Boca Raton, Florida. He will receive treatments four times each day, for six days each week. This will help him regain motor function by increasing his neuromuscular activation and control.Simply stated, Liam loves his job. He thrives off helping others and firefighting quickly became his passion.As a family, we feel so incredibly blessed for the unwavering love and support we have received from Liam’s firefighting family, friends, nurses, doctors, and even strangers.

We were close by and rushed her to an emergency vet. Her front right leg is completely shattered (requiring orthopedic surgery) and her front left leg is also broken (hopefully requiring only splinting), among other urgent medical needs. We were told we had to take financial responsibility for her or she'd be euthanized due to her severe injuries and the fact that we cannot find her owner. We are committed to saving her life, fostering her until she recovers, and making sure we find her the best loving home...we just need some financial support to do it!The Full Story: While on our way to dinner with a friend last night, my girlfriend and I passed a church with what looked like a stray dog running loose in the front. We turned around to see if there was an owner nearby or if she had on tags that could identify her owner. After stopping the car, the dog reluctantly approached me with her tail between her legs. I allowed her sniff me and snuck some pets in to gain her trust. While doing this, I felt for her collar and noticed there were no tags. In this moment, she bolted and I couldn't grab ahold of her. I am kicking myself for not having a firm grasp on her.Almost as soon as we started to follow her, she bolted into the street and was hit by a car. Immediately, we heard her screaming for help, saw that her front right leg was flimsy, and blood coming from her head. People stopped to help and we all scrambled to find a local emergency vet. All the while, Arya was crying for help and trying to limp away with her three working legs. She was in so much pain she lost control of her bowel movements while laying on the street helplessly.We found an emergency vet hospital 15 minutes away so we rushed her into the back of our car wrapped in a sheet and drove her there. I will never forget sitting in the back seat with Arya and her begging for us to stop the pain. Upon arriving at the vet, they learned she is not microchipped. With the owner nowhere to be found, they did a quick evaluation and determined she needed to be stabilized for the trauma and sedated to ease the pain and splint her shattered leg as well as the other broken leg. The vet also needed to do imaging to identify any potential internal bleeding. The vet tech explained our options were to let Arya (approximately 4-6 years old according to the vet) be euthanized or take financial responsibility for her. We chose to give her a chance, because we would want someone to do the same for our two dogs.The funds we are asking for will solely be used to help Arya get back to 100%. That includes:- Covering the ER services and consultations (fluids, pain meds, splinting, constant supervision, x-rays, other imaging, etc.)- Orthopedic surgery (front right leg), repairing the front left break (splinting and/or surgery), and all preparation- Post surgery rehabilitation, necessary vet visits, medicine, everything else she will needWe are so grateful for anyone that is able to help us give this sweet girl a fighting chance by donating or sharing this post with your network in hopes that someone else is able to support.Once Arya has recovered from the surgery, we would also like to find someone that can give her a loving FURever home!

Owning a motorcycle is a dream he’s had his entire life. Unfortunately, shortly after finally owning his bike, his dream came to a screeching halt. He hit a culvert and broke his neck, injuring his C3 and spinal cord. After being transported from Plattsburgh Hospital to Burlington ICU, we waited for the swelling to go down for surgery. At that time he had very little function in his arms/hands. Finally, after surgery there seems to be some hope. He will be transferred to Fanny Allen Rehabilitation Center. He’s going to have a long road ahead and an abundance of medical expenses. He currently has Medicare for insurance but we know it will not cover everything. The expenses of travel food, lodging, and medical bills will be very detrimental for the family as we’ve had to take off of work to try and be there support him. He is determined to try and make the best of what has happened. We are hopeful with rehabilitation and the surgery he will be able to use his hands again.

Dear friends,We hope you and your loved ones are safe and doing well during this COViD-19 pandemic. We at Wabii Maccaa Association (WMA) are pleading for your help to support the victims of crisis of displacement, food shortage, lack of shelter, and to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in western Oromia, particularly Wallaga, Ethiopia. People in this part of the world have been living under brutal military rule and all communication with the rest of the world were cut as the disease started spreading around the world. Millions were kept in the dark while the rest of the world was preparing to fight the spread of the disease. The disease has now arrived at their door and they are unprepared. WMA is conducting a fundraising campaign to help them.Funds raised in this campaign will be used to meet the needs of the most vulnerable families and persons in the current humanitarian crisis and provide materials to support those affected by the disease. As a new nonprofit, WMA aims to mobilize resources to respond effectively to the kinds of crisis mentioned above with the goal of rehabilitation and sustainable development. Therefore, we appeal to your compassion and hope that you consider supporting this effort to save the lives of the most vulnerable. No amount is too large or too small - your generosity and compassionate gesture is what counts. Let us save as many lives as we can so that when this is over, we can tell ourselves, we did what we could. Wabii Maccaa Association (WMA), a non-profit, humanitarian organization, registered in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota and the United States of America and your contribution is tax deductible.

Many of you have offered your assistance in this time of emergency, and so I wanted to share, with those of you who are able, a direct line to help put Zac back together!As many of you have heard, Zac was in a bike accident yesterday at Brushy Creek. He was riding some beautiful and familiar local trails when he felt awkward near a landing, and made the decision to dismount his bike and land on his feet. The force of his landing displaced, crushed, and fractured his tibial plateau. Luckily he was with a dear friend, and was picked up by an incredible EMT team and was speedily admitted to the Dell Seton hospital yesterday afternoon.As an experienced cyclist, mechanic, ambassador, and advocate for all things bicycle-related, this news was shocking and deeply saddening.Displaced tibial plateau fractures make up 1% of all fracture injuries, but unfortunately are very serious, and require extensive surgery as well as months of intense rehabilitation.Zac has currently undergone an external fixator surgery to hold his knee joint in place until the swelling reduces enough to do another internal corrective surgery at the end of the week. This surgery will involve an incision being made and a metal plate and screws being placed on the damaged bone to hold it together. He will not be able to bear weight on this leg for at least three months post surgery, which means he will have very limited work ability for that time and potentially beyond.We are hoping to raise $10,000 to cover the medical expenses and help alleviate the burden of serious work limitations during his rehabilitation. We are hoping to raise this money within the next month so that he has the security and stability needed to focus on the long road to recovery.So many of you have reached out with words of love and compassion, and we are feeling truly blessed. If you are unable to donate but would like to help in other ways, we would love your support.

Shortly after, Danielle suffered serious complications and severe blood loss. She was rushed to surgery where they operated for ten hours. Throughout the surgery she lost over double the body's supply of blood. After the surgeries, Danielle was completely unresponsive and doctors told Zac she may be left in a vegetative state if she survived. With only two pints of blood left in Athens county and her organs failing, the decision was made to have life flight transport her to an ICU in Columbus.Danielle is currently still in the ICU as she continues to fight for her life. Doctors currently cannot pinpoint what is wrong as she continues to face blood loss and organ failure.Danielle has touched a lot of lives throughout her time as a nurse and educator. We know these are difficult times given the current pandemic, but we are asking friends and family to help if they can, however they can.

Our dad, John Hekker was involvedin a bicycle vs car collision on Wednesday February 24, 2021 in Augusta, Georgia. In addition to being a great cyclist our dad is a wonderful nurse at Augusta University Medical Center. While biking to work he was struck at an intersection by a driver who was not paying attention.

Anyone that knows ourdad, is aware that cycling is his passion!

We are so very thankful that he is strong and a survivor.

However, his life will be forever changed. He sustained many injuries and fractures. He will be wheelchair bound/ non weight bearing for a minimum of 8-12 weeks.









He will require extensive rehabilitation and family support. At this time we are asking for donations to help support his medical deductibles and any additional financial assistance he may need during this hard time.









He has had an extended ICU stay and we are hoping that he will stabilize and transfer to the floor soon.

Thank you for your support at this time!

He was rushed to UC Davis Medical Center where he underwent an extensive emergency surgery, to insert a plate from C4-6 to stabilize his spine. Surgery was long, but went very well, and he has been in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit ever since. Ryan is lucky to be alive and his accident has unfortunately left him with limited mobility at the moment. As you can imagine, Ryan is devastated, but still manages to show some signs of his classic sense of humor and charm. At the end of the day, reuniting with his daughter Nalani is his main concern and he will do anything to get to this point.
Three days after surgery, Ryan’s healing process was complicated by a weakened left lung and pneumonia. This was an emotional moment when the doctors decided to re-intubate him and keep him on a ventilator to help him breathe. Frustration reached an all-time high as there were multiple tubes down his throat that prevented him from being able to talk and communicate easily. Although Ryan continued to improve daily, on July 10th, 2 weeks after the original accident, the doctors made the decision to do a tracheotomy to help him breathe and manage his secretions while his lungs fully heal. After two days, Ryan no longer needed the ventilator and he felt much better. Currently, his doctors are unable to determine the level of impairment as he is still in the early stages of recovery. Once he is stable with his breathing and transferred out of the ICU, he will be moved to a rehabilitation center where he will be able to focus 100% of his energy on gaining mobility and getting his independence back.Prior to the injury, Ryan lived a VERY active lifestyle. Ryan loved camping, boating, wakeboarding, snowboarding, softball 24/7, working on cars, and coaching his daughter just to name a few. We all know Ryan to be strong and athletic. He is adamant about getting back to a life of normalcy. Ryan is one of the strongest people we know, and he will not give up on himself. With lots of support, prayers, love, encouragement, and rehab, we are optimistic he will have a favorable recovery. Despite this tragic situation, we’ve had some smiles and laughs, which makes the days seem so much brighter! Please keep him in your thoughts and prayers in the days to come. He needs all the positive healing energy he can get!
If you know Ryan, you know asking for help is not his forte. However, this is a one in a million exception. There have been many requests in ways to help, which is the reason we decided to set up this go fund me. Any support is greatly appreciated. All donations will help relieve some of the financial burden Ryan is already feeling and will go directly to medical bills and helping Ryan prepare for life when he returns home. Please help us spread this message on your Facebook timeline!We will update you all in vital moments moving forward. On behalf of Ryan and his family, we truly appreciate the outpour of love and support from everyone! Thank you!

My Sister Michelle and Carlos’ world changed in a matter of seconds that Friday They went from the first night thinking her son was going to go into emergency brain surgery to thankfully having the doctors determine that the bleeding wasn’t severe enough as they ran more tests. After a CT scan and MRI they found they could try to fix the AVM via a procedure called Embolization through an angiogram. The procedure was performed on Tuesday March 9th and the doctor was able to plug the veins that were causing the bleed, Thank You God! Now comes recovery. He has to go back a couple weeks for more test to ensure everything was caught and fixed because his brain is swollen. Our Andres has to undergo physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy to regain the motor skills that he has temporarily lost. He is currently at Cedar Sinai and will be transferred to Children Hospital of LA next week to commence rehabilitation.At this time our family is reaching out to our extended family and friends for prayers for our little man and monetary help if possible for medical bills that my sister and Carlos will have to face.

On November 25th, less than a week after her 2nd birthday, Luna was rushed to the hospital after suffering a stroke. Scans determined that it was caused by an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in her brain which had ruptured. Surgery was successfully performed to relieve the pressure on her brain. 

She is going to be in the hospital until her brain has recovered enough to have surgery to remove the AVM. Once she is released from hospital, she will still need physical therapy to recover from the stroke. She is currently sedated and in stable condition at the Children's Hospital. Her mom and dad have been by her side nonstop. 





WHY ME? 
My name is Marshall, and I am Luna's uncle. I can see her hospital from my desk at work. My family and I plan to spoil Luna rotten while she is in the hospital, and we need your help for what comes next. 

Anything you can spare will lessen the burden that her parents will bear going forward. All money raised will go towards Luna's hospital or physical therapy bills and ONLY towards her medical bills."

After attending the Chatham Independence Day parade, a family tradition, Jack along with friends and cousins headed to the beach. Tragically, Jack broke his neck while swimming and sustained a devastating C6 spinal cord injury that changed his life. He was airlifted to Tufts Medical Center and underwent two surgeries over six hours to stabilize his spine. Known as hard-working, a National Honor student, athlete, funny and a loyal friend, Jack was weeks away from beginning his freshman year at University of Massachusetts. Instead of packing his bags, Jack delayed his enrollment, and is focused on his recovery at Spaulding Rehabilitation Center. His injuries are extensive, with paralysis robbing him of independence and the ability to walk and use his hands. Always looking forward, Jack is positive, learning to live with his paralysis, and focused on recovery through aggressive physical therapy. In a recent post to friends, Jack’s hope and determination is clear: “I believe I’ll be able to get back what I have lost, it is just an obstacle I have to overcome. The positivity from my friends and family have made it that much easier to fight, every day”.In addition to the unwavering love, prayers, visits and texts, so many have reached out and asked how they can help. Friends of the Gerard family have set up this GoFundMe page to help the family financially. Any gift amount makes a difference to help defray the unanticipated expenses and life style changes that accompany Jack’s injury.

We were told the impacts of this would not be known until he reached or did not reach certain milestones. We didn't know if he would walk, talk, or do most of the things that one associates with childhood.We worked with specialists from the day he was born to maximize the opportunities for recovery. We have been thrilled with the progress he has made.For those of you who know him, you know that he is a vibrant, loving and active 7-year-old. While he is thriving in many areas, the stroke did result in some damage that has impacted his life. Alex has some mobility challenges, as the stroke damaged an area which has impacted his ability to move as most kids or adults can.In medical terms, Alex has Spastic Cerebral Palsy. This means that parts of his body (primarily his right leg and to a lesser degree his right arm) get ""tight"" and make it more difficult for him to walk or use his arm. Physiologically, there is nothing wrong with his leg or arm, it is his brain that is sending the wrong types of messages to his leg and arm, essentially telling it to tighten up. This is almost like a muscle flexing.What does this mean for Alex? Besides making it challenging to walk or run, this causes him pain. This makes it more difficult for him to sleep at night, often sleeps are more restless and he is up early as a result. It also takes a lot of extra energy for his body to find ways to compensate or adjust to the constant tightness in his leg. This has resulted in a more laboured way to walk, which will eventually result in hip damage so severe that he will need a hip replacement around the age of 40.There are many things we have tried to help reduce the impacts of the tightness (medically referred to as spasticity), including physiotherapy, massage therapy, Botox treatments (to paralyze the muscles in his leg getting the ""bad"" messages to tighten up), muscle relaxants, and have explored different surgery options like tendon lengthening. All of these are temporary and have offered limited success. We thought there was nothing else we could do, until we learned of a procedure pioneered in the United States called a Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR).While the aforementioned procedures are treating the muscles and tendons temporarily, the SDR procedure is a permanent solution to stop the spasticity from happening. It stops the ""bad"" messages from ever making it to the leg.Here is the basics of how the procedure works: In your spine there are a network of nerves that run from your brain to the rest of your body. These nerves look almost like hairs, but are smaller. Alex's leg has many of these nerves controlling different areas of the muscles, some are getting good messages while others are getting the messages to become tight. A neurosurgeon opens a section of the spine, tests the ""nerve rootlets"" to identify which of the batch are sending the bad messages. Once identified, they are permanently severed, which results in only the good messages being received by his leg (here is a more detailed explanation).We have been told his leg will be free of the spasticity and will require 3 weeks of intense daily physiotherapy to relearn how to walk. The entire procedure would result in a stay of approximately 4 weeks in St Louis, Missouri.At the recommendation of our neurosurgeon in Manitoba, we applied to St Louis in the summer of 2019. In parallel, our neurosurgeon began exploring a new program, which recently opened in Toronto's Sick Kids hospital. The program in Ontario has been quite clear in correspondence with me that they work exclusively on patients from Ontario only and on children who are affected on both sides of the body. As we are Manitobans and Alex is only affected on his right side, we don't see this as an option.Our neurosurgeon explained that the type of surgeon who performs a surgery like SDR is a neurosurgeon and they are primarily working on patients with tumors or brain/spine injuries. They categorize a procedure like Alex's as an improvement to quality of life, but not one to save his life so it is not a high priority. The program in Ontario performs several of these procedures a month, whereas the program in St Louis just recently completed its 4,000 successful procedure.We were overjoyed to receive an email in the fall delivering the news that Alex was accepted into the St Louis program and has been scheduled for October 2020. They have indicated that they may bump up the surgery to the summer of 2020, as we have indicated this would be our preference.In the event Manitoba agrees to pay, it will only be a portion. The remainder of the costs would be up to Chelsea and I to come up with as a family. The costs of the surgery, accommodations, food, travel and post-operative rehabilitation are estimated to be approximately $100,000.00 Canadian. A daunting number, but as a parent you know you would do anything for your child, especially if it will change their life for the better.It was because of the encouragement of family and friends like you, that we decided to move forward with a gofundme page for a portion of total costs. Whether you are able to contribute or not, know that we still love you all. Thanks for reading this short novel. I would be happy to speak to anyone who has questions about anything I have written about here today. It is a complex topic and can be difficult to explain, let alone understand.Sincerely,Chris and Chelsea BohemierRead more"

Unfortunately, a serious medical emergency has affected Anne, and she and her husband Brett need our help. Anne started to experience pain and spasms in her shoulder/spine area a couple of months ago. She sought treatment from multiple providers but there was no relief. Anne continued to have increased pain, and started to experience neurological symptoms within the last couple of weeks. Thankfully, Anne found a Neurologist who did an MRI scan on June 23, 2020. By the time of the MRI, Anne was experiencing numbness, electrical shocking sensations, weakness and an unsteady gait. Unfortunately, while waiting for the MRI results, Anne continued to decline even further, and experienced several falls. On Monday, June 29, 2020, Anne was unable to walk or move her legs. During a telehealth visit with her Neurologist, Anne was informed she had a mass on her spine and needed to go to the Emergency Room immediately. Anne was transported via ambulance to the University of MN Fairview Hospital. Within 4 hours, Anne was in the operating room. After an approximately 6 hour surgery, the Neurosurgeon felt he was able to remove the mass that was impinging on her thoracic spine as well as her spinal cord/nerves. He also felt it was contained to that area, but further treatment decisions may be needed based on biopsy results.Today, June 30, 2020, Anne is currently in the ICU. She is responding to touch, and is regaining some movement. However, her recovery will be long term and arduous. She is expected to remain in the ICU for several days, then to a non ICU floor for several more days, and then to a rehabilitation facility for several weeks to a month. All of this care will be extremely expensive.If you know Anne, you know of her extreme passion for pets. She owns her own pet sitting business, but due to Covid, client visits had decreased. Anne was substituting her income with other means (Instacart, etc), but the pain and neurological symptoms made it impossible to work. The funds will be used to help pay off any debt incurred as well as to adapt Anne's living situation as needed. Hopefully she will be able to regain full mobility, but it is going to take some time.We all love Anne for her quirky, sparkly and fun personality. Many of her friends have been in her life for 20 plus years and consider her family. Its time for her family to rally around her. Any amount is helpful, and if you do not have the means (it is Covid time, after all), positive thoughts her way are of course appreciated! Sharing of this campaign is also encouraged! Of note, I will add Brett and Anne as direct beneficiaries, so they can use the funds as the bills start rolling in. Thank you all for considering.Read more"

[FOR ENGLISH SCROLL DOWN]Beste lezer, vriend, familie of kennis,Allereerst wil ik u bedanken dat u de moeite wilt nemen om dit verhaal te lezen.Sharon heeft hulp nodig om de verzorging van haar partner thuis mogelijk te maken.Plotseling stond onze wereld ruim een jaar geleden stil.Ruim een jaar geleden heeft Aldrin een hartstilstand gekregen en is hij minutenlang gereanimeerd. Aldrin heeft ernstig zuurstoftekort gehad in zijn hersenen en zijn hersenen zijn ernstig beschadigd geraakt.Op het moment van schrijven is Aldrin zwaar beperkt en verblijft hij in een revalidatiecentrum in Dordrecht. Aldrin kan niet spreken of lopen. Ondanks alles, lijkt het soms alsof hij nog wel met ons contact probeert te maken. Dit kleine stukje contact geeft ons hoop.Mijn zus, Sharon, woont samen met haar drie dochters, waarvan één pas twee jaar oud is. Meerdere malen per week rijdt Sharon op en neer naar Dordrecht om bij Aldrin te zijn en hem te verzorgen. Dit is voor haar ontzettend intensief. Sharon kan door deze zorg niet meer een voltijdbaan vervullen. Niet alleen kost het haar ontzettend veel tijd en geld, maar ook is het mentaal enorm zwaar om haar beste vriend, maatje en levenspartner zo te zien liggen. Met elkaar praten en grapjes maken kan niet meer.Samen hadden Aldrin en Sharon het goed voor elkaar. In 2018 hebben zij een lieve dochter gekregen waar Aldrin hartstikke gek op is. Haar zien opgroeien heeft een andere betekenis gekregen. Jailey zal ‘papa’ niet leren kennen zoals wij hem kennen.Sharon is een ontzettend sterk persoon, waarvoor ik heel veel respect heb. Ze heeft zich de afgelopen tijd ontzettend sterk gehouden en zich door alle tegenslagen heen gevochten. En nu probeer ik haar te steunen met deze actie. Zij en Aldrin hebben echt hulp nodig.Aldrin gaat binnenkort naar huis. Om hem te kunnen laten revalideren is er geld nodig. Geld om met hem te kunnen oefenen en te communiceren door middel van een oogbesturingscomputer. Geld voor een Motomed fiets om hem te kunnen laten bewegen en geld om zijn verdere revalidatie te kunnen bekostigen.Ik vraag u om hulp. Zou u een kleine donatie kunnen missen om Sharon verder te kunnen helpen? Het afgelopen jaar hebben we geleerd dat je alleen niet alles kan oplossen, maar samen een heel eind kunt komen. Ik hoop dat uw bijdrage, al is het een beetje, hen kan helpen.- Melanie Algera-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[ENGLISH VERSION]Dear reader, friend, family or acquaintance,First of all, I would like to thank you for taking the time to read this story.My name is Melanie Algera and my sister Sharon needs help to take care of her partner at home. That’s why I am making this funding page. Suddenly, our world came to a halt over a year ago. More than a year ago Aldrin, my sisters’ partner, suffered from a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated for minutes. Aldrin has had a severe oxygen deficiency in his brain and his brain has been seriously damaged because of this. At the moment, Aldrin is severely limited and is staying in a rehabilitation centre in Dordrecht. Aldrin is not able to speak or walk. Despite anything, it sometimes seems as if he is still trying to make contact with us. This little bit of contact gives us hope. My sister, Sharon, lives with her three daughters, one of whom is only two years old in The Netherlands. Several times a week, Sharon drives up and down the country to Dordrecht to be with Aldrin and to take care of him. This is very intensive for her. Sharon can no longer fulfil a full-time job because of this concern. Not only does it cost her a lot of time and money, but it is also mentally difficult to see her best friend, buddy and life partner lying like this. It is no longer possible to talk and joke to each other. Sharon and Aldrin are a perfect couple. In 2018 their daughter was born that Aldrin is very fond of. Watching her grow up had taken on a different meaning. Jailey will not get to know her “daddy” as we know him. Sharon is a very strong person, for which I have a lot of respect. She has kept very strong lately and fought trough all the setbacks. And now I try to support her with this funding. She and Aldrin really need our help.Aldrin is going home soon. Money is needed to allow him to recover. Money to practice and communicate with him by using an eye control computer. Money for a Motomed bicycle to keep him moving and money for his further rehabilitation. I want to ask you for help. Could you miss a small donation to help Sharon?

My brother Neil had a life changing motorbike accident on July 17 which left him with spinal injuries, paralysis and the need for facial reconstruction surgery. Sadly he is now a quadriplegic. Neil is not someone who normally asks for help, but his family and friends are asking for your help now. Neil needs you. He needs positive vibes, positive energy, encouraging words, and some big financial support.After a day of surfing with his good mate Dave, Neil had a motorbike accident. When Neil didn’t return home, Dave went back looking for him. Four hours later he was found in a ditch with the motorbike on top of him. He was taken to hospital where x-rays and CT scans showed fractures in his vertebrae that required a spinal cord specialist.It was clear he required specialised medical treatment so he was transported to the international hospital in Bali (BIMC) - a gruelling 6 hour ambulance ride. He had multiple surgeries and he now has stabiliser plates supporting his fractured neck. Neil spent a month in the Intensive Care Unit at BIMC before we were able to Medi-vac him back to Australia - an extremely difficult task during a global pandemic, closed international borders, language barriers, & no government assistance. The hospital bill in Bali came to a staggering AU$83,000. The Medi-vac flight was an additional AU$106,000.Anyone who knows Neil, knows of his love for surfing. Originally a Byron Bay boy, his love for the water and for surfing became part of his DNA while living in Bondi as a teenager and being part of the surfing community. It is here that he found his surfing brothers – a family that continues to grow.Surfing has given Neil an escape from the challenges of his mental health. It has given him light when for a time there was only darkness, and it’s for this reason that he’d made Indonesia and its waves his home. It was heartbreaking to not be able to travel to be by Neil’s side during such a traumatic time. We are very grateful to Matt Elks who took time out from his family to be by Neil’s side at the hospital, and to give us continual updates. When this first happened I thanked Matt for being away from his family so that he could be with mine. Matt just said ‘Lou, I know he would do the same thing for me’.We have been desperately trying to raise funds.It’s such a heart breaking & challenging time. Neil remains in hospital at Royal North Shore and will be transferred to Ryde Royal Rehabilitation Hospital in the next few days where he will spend the next few months. Going forward this will be a tough journey for him. We’re asking for your help. Give as little or as much as you can. It’s all going to help, and it all matters. Keep sending your positive energy to him, and your positive comments on Facebook. Share this far and wide. We can’t do this alone. We’re asking for help. We need you. Neil needs you.

  On February 9, 2020 Andre, Kelsey and their two month old baby boy Rhet were involved in a tragic car accident. Sadly Andre passed away.   Andre was Kelsey’s best friend and her other half. He was one of a kind. He was so excited to be a role model for Rhet to look up to. Andre was hard working, humble, and determined to provide the best life for his family. He loved dirt biking, skiing, being an adventurer but most recently his greatest passion was being a daddy.   Kelsey is currently in the hospital with multiple breaks and fractures. She has had several surgeries that have saved her life, including her from almost being paralyzed. Although she is now healing, Rhet is still fighting for his life. He broke both of his femurs and has severe swelling of the brain. If Rhet survives, he will be left with permanent brain damage and severe disabilities that are not yet known.   On the day of the accident, family was celebrating Rhet and his arrival into the world.  This little family did not have much time together. They have been broken. Although we grieve the death of Andre we are fighting to save his little boy.   Kelsey has a long road of recovery ahead of her and she prays that it includes being a mommy to her little boy, but she will need help.   Kelsey does not ask for handouts, however this page has been started so she can support her little man if she is blessed with the opportunity to do so.   Money donated through this page will be used for Kelsey’s rehabilitation, any special resources that Rhet may require and living expenses for the two of them.   If you are unable to donate Kelsey asks that you pray for Rhet so he gets the chance to grow up and be the special boy he was meant to be.   Thank you.

ASK FOR HELP.Those closest to me, know, that if I am asking for help then I TRULY need it! I am one of those people that hates to be a burden to anyone. I keep my struggles to myself and put on my brave face. In fact, most of you probably do not know that I have been going through a separation/divorce for over 2 years now.My mental health has bottomed out, and I don't know what else I can do. Except, ASK FOR HELP!I feel an explanation is in order....Ed and I have been together since 1999, we married in 2005, had Max our first child in 2006(when I nearly died). We moved from NY to NC in 2007, bought our dream home in 2008. And so, we began to build our life together. Of course our marriage had its ups and downs, as most do, it was by no means perfect. It was riddled with financial struggles and fertility issues( I had 6 extremely hard and devestating miscarriages in just about as many years). Then November 2016, I found out I was, yet again, pregnant. My previous miscarriage, the year before, was the worst yet, lasting the longest and requiring a D&C. I was terrified. I prayed the hardest I have EVER prayed, that God would FINALLY complete our family, that Max would finally have the sibling that he had always asked for but I could never give him. I didn't tell Ed right away, I knew he had reached his limit emotionally as well. Finally I told him and his response was, what are you going to do about it? What was I going to do about it? I was going to FIGHT, with all my heart and soul, to keep this baby! And that's exactly what I did. EVERY SINGLE DAY I lived in fear that I would lose this baby. It consumed me. A month passed, two months passed, THREE MONTHS passed! I had never gone this far, but I would not DARE have any hope. I knew it was going to happen, I would lose my baby, like I always did...Finally we were able to find out it was a boy! Was Max going to finally have a little brother?!?! Two more months passed... The Drs kept telling me everything looked good.... I never was able to have any sense of peace, always waiting for the worst.... The wonderful women at my job threw me my first baby shower( I never got to have one with Max because he came 5 weeks early) it was the best/worst day of my life... I was so excited to see all the baby stuff, but terrified that I would have to return or give it all away when the inevitable happened.Two more months passed, still the Drs assured me everything was good, how can this be?!? Surely any day now I would lose my sweet baby boy?? Was God going to finally give me the gift of a second child? I couldn't hope.... My wonderful family threw me my SECOND baby shower!! All my family and friends finally able to celebrate a baby with me!After, I sat in the nursery, which was not ready, because I wouldn't dare create a nursery yet! And looked at EVERYTHING I had received for my beautiful miracle growing in my belly. At that moment I decided I was going to believe he was coming into this world.... I started opening everything. I was going to feel joy for this baby. I was going to build my dream nursery, something I didn't have for Max, because we lived in a one bedroom apartment. I nested, HARD, for the next few weeks. It was creeping closer and closer to my due date... All I wanted was to be able to carry my baby to term. I thought for sure the Drs would make me have my c-section at least 2 weeks early, but again by some miracle they scheduled me only 3 days earlier than my due date! I was going to be able to experience almost a full pregnancy! I was so HAPPY! Yes finally I was able to feel joy!But that was VERY short lived.....You see Ed had been acting very strange lately, at first I chalked it up to him being nervous about the pregnancy. (Because along with losing the baby at any time, there was also a VERY HIGH possibility I would have complications again, and as informed by many Drs, a good chance I might not survive. )Honestly I was so consumed with fear and worry over my pregnancy I didn't really notice, until the last month of my pregnancy, that Ed was acting weird. I started to suspect something was going on.And then one day while he was out, his tablet made a funny noise, I turned it on and in his Snapchat notifications I see""I LOVE U""... from a woman he works with.....I was 3 weeks away from having our miracle baby! How could this be happening to me? Why God?!I confronted him, but of course there was denial. ""We're just talking"". She was having problems with her husband, and apparently he had issues about us he felt the need to talk to her about.How was I going to have this baby in a few weeks! I was devastated, completely....He worked with this woman, saw her everyday, she was not going to go away. How was this going to be repaired? I started to question everything. Do I bring a baby into this family that is clearly broken? Do I stay with a man that could have done this to his pregnant wife? How was I going to have this baby without the support of my husband...The next 3 weeks I cried like no person has ever cried, my joy was just sucked completely out. What a fool I was..... My baby, FINALLY, my miracle baby, was going to be here.... Born into our broken home....Lucas Edward was born, August 9, 2017, our rainbow baby.... Max was FINALLY a big brother, something he had always wanted!The happiest/ saddest day of my life.Ed pleaded for me to stay. Said he would do whatever I needed him to do in order for me to stay....I agreed..... With only one condition... He was to have no contact with this other woman, aside from direct communication about work, he was to block and delete her number from his phone and on all social media.That was it....Having a new baby is a hard enough strain on a healthy marriage, but one that has been devastated it is ten fold. The trust needed to be earned back. We tried counseling but I didn't see any remorse or responsibility taken for his actions.And then I found the texts... He was still having conversations with her via text messaging, about non work related things, again I confronted him. That was the last blow for me.I tried for a year to make it work, but I knew she was always going to be between us. He couldn't do the ONE thing I had asked to earn back his trust. So, I made the hardest decision of my life. I told him I wanted a divorce.Well, that was it, I was the one who was ending our marriage according to him.He would not leave, even though he was the one who betrayed out marriage, our family.... So I had no choice, in North Carolina you have to live separate for a year in order to get a divorce. I had to leave my beautiful home with my two children, and move into an apartment with NO support from him, because, again, I was the one who ruined our marriage and was leaving.November 2018, with the help of my sister, I was able to get an apartment. I slept on a mattress on the floor and was barely able to put food on the table, while he got to stay in our home. I had pennies left over after my paychecks. A week after I moved out he started redoing the house, removing all evidence that I had been there.He was cruel and uncaring, verbally abusing me via text, constantly threaten me saying he was going to take my children away from me. Threatening to cancel my phone he was paying for. How can someone be so cruel to a person they claimed to love for almost 20 years, especially when they were the one who betrayed the marriage?I kept telling myself all I had to do was make it through the year... And then it would be over.... I would be free of him....What. A. Fool. I. Was.The financial hardships just kept getting worse, still no support from him.I was also trying to take care of my mother who was in a rehabilitation center, due to a stroke she had a few years earlier. Buying her clothes and necessities and food that were constantly going missing or being destroyed.My car was totaled in accident in October 2018. I had to purchase a new one on my own, put car insurance under my name alone now, which meant higher rates.My lease was renewing and increasing $125 a month. I couldn't even afford what it was already.The one year mark came and I just had NO money to file for the divorce, of course Ed wasn't going to pay for it.And then two days before Christmas Ed lost his job. Even with all my hardships, I tried to help him, so he didn't lose our house, by letting him keep our tax return money.We are all without health insurance now, and this was at the beginning of Covid!March 2019 he finally gets a job, but says F*CK YOU! I'm not putting you on my insurance and leaves me with NO health insurance during a GLOBAL PANDEMIC!There is no way I can afford insurance through my job.Then the world shut down. I was out of work for 3 weeks, no pay. I tried to get unemployment but was denied. Never could get through to them. 3 weeks without money, when you are already struggling was the tipping point.By the time we had gotten our stimulus, all bills were behind, and late fees had piled up. My hole was getting deeper. And still Ed was not giving me any financial support.Then the end of June my mother passed away, due to an infection in her foot that no one had informed me about. And because of Covid I had not seen her since March Two days after my mom passed Lucas said to me casually that he wanted to go to the playground with the the little girl again??? After a bit, I realized he was talking about the woman's daughter, the woman who came between our family.... The woman he said he hated and never wanted to see again.I confronted him once more and it was confirmed, he was in a relationship with her.I begged him to just file for a divorce, so I could be free, he clearly had moved on.But he knows once we get divorced he will have to split our home and pay support.Now, it's just been him trying to screw me over in the divorce, saying he is coming after me for $20,000 in back mortgage payments for the past 2 years, adding in a bunch of fees and taxes, etc. Basically trying to make it so I get no money from the sale or refinance of our home, our only marital assets.It's gotten to the point where I need to hire a lawyer to protect myself, from the one person in my life I thought I would always be safe with, but I can't...That's why I'm asking for help, from my friends and family, who I know are all dealing with their own struggles...The hardest thing I've ever done in my life.I need help. ❤️

Ich konnte mir vorstellen Vieles zu schreiben. Ich habe mir nie vorgestellt, ich könnte einmal das hier schreiben.Früh am Sonntagmorgen des 25. Januars 2016 bekam ich einen FaceTime-Anruf von meiner Mutter. Sie schaffte es nicht einmal den Satz zu beenden bevor sie in Tränen ausbrach. Meine Tante musste die Nachricht überbringen. In der Nacht zuvor war meine Schwester Katharina in einem schrecklichen Autounfall verwickelt. Katharina war noch immer im OP, als ich den Anruf bekam. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt gaben die Ärzte ihr eine 50/50-Chance zu überleben.Sie hatte die Kontrolle über ihr Auto verloren, war in eine Leitplanke und anschließend in ein Verkehrsschild gekracht. Größtenteils unverletzt, aber orientierungslos krabbelte sie aus dem Auto im Seitengraben und wankte auf die Straße zurück, wo sie zusammenbrach. Bewusstlos auf dem Asphalt liegend wurde sie von einem anderen Fahrzeug überrollt. Die Fahrerin stoppte sofort und rief den Krankenwagen.Katharina überstand die 11-stündige OP, aber es war zu früh, um die bleibenden Konsequenzen einzuschätzen. Es sollte die erste von sechs großen OPs im Laufe der nächsten vier Monate sein. Sie verbrachte eine Woche im künstlichen Koma und einige mehr auf der Intensivstation. Im Moment meines Schreibens ist sie noch immer im Krankenhaus.Als Katharina vom Auto überrollt wurde, zertrümmerte dies ihr Becken. Dazu kamen beschädigte innere Organe, Harnblase und Darm wurden zerfetzt, die Lunge gequetscht, Rippenfrakturen, ein Leberriss und gebrochene Rückenwirbel, die zu einer Einblutung im Rückenmark führten. Ihr Rückenmark war aber nicht ein- oder durchgerissen. Das ist wichtig. Als wäre dies alles noch nicht genug, lag sie sich aufgrund der langen Liegezeit am Steißbein wund.Katharina hatte mehrere Ops, um die verletzten Organe zu versorgen, die Rückenwirbel und das Becken zu stabilisieren. Sie erholt sich momentan in einem Krankenhaus in Heidelberg. Die Ärzte sind äußerst zufrieden mit dem Heilungsverlauf und sagen, dass sie im Augenblick keine weiteren OPs benötigen wird. Ihre Rückenmarksverletzung sorgt nach wie vor für Verwunderung. Basierend auf der Position der Verletzung sollte Katharina weder Arme noch Beine bewegen können. Unerklärlicherweise, kann sie ihre Arme uneingeschränkt nutzen. Etwas oberhalb des Bauchnabels beginnt ihre Querschnittslähmung. Im Rumpf ist sie noch sehr instabil, sie kann ihre Beine fühlen, aber nicht bewegen.Seit sieben Wochen macht Katharina jetzt Physiotherapie. Als sie angefangen hat, konnte sie mit ihren Beinen nichts tun. Mittlerweile kann sie Muskelspannung aufbauen, d.h. wenn sie im Bett liegt und ein Bein aufgestellt wird, kann Katharina Muskeln anspannen, um zu verhindern, dass das Bein nach links oder rechts wegkippt. Als ich sie vor drei Wochen das letzte Mal besuchte, der Tag bevor ich nach England zurückflog, konnte sie die Zehen ihres rechten Fuss’ etwas bewegen. Die Chancen für den weiteren Heilungsverlauf sind schwer einzuschätzen, aber was sie bisher geleistet hat ist phänomenal und übertrifft die meisten Erwartungen. Leider, trotz all dieser Fortschritte wird ihr von der Therapeutenseite immer wieder gesagt, dass Gehfähigkeit nicht erreicht wird.Nach einer schwierigen Übergangsphase, hat meine Schwester sich zu einem gewissen Level damit arrangiert im Rollstuhl zu sitzen. Aber sie hat es nicht akzeptiert. Sie mag es nicht mit Menschen nicht auf Augenhöhe zu sein. Sie mag es nicht, dass Menschen auf sie herabschauen. Der Gedanke außerhalb des Krankenhauses im Rollstuhl zu sein bereitet Ihr Unwohlsein. Sie arbeitet jeden Tag sehr hart. Zusammen mit den Physios und für sich allein, sie arbeitet physisch und mental. Sie tut alles was in ihrer Macht steht. Sie weiß natürlich, dass sie nie wieder normal laufen wird. Sie weiß, dass sie nie wieder rennen wird. ABER sie hat die Hoffnung nicht aufgegeben, dass die wieder stehen kann, dass sie wieder ein paar Schritte machen kann, vielleicht mit einem Rollator gehen kann. Ich glaube sie wird es schaffen. Ich glaube sie wird es allen zeigen. Ich glaube sie ist stark genug, um jedes Hindernis zu überwinden. Und wenn Ihr wollt könnt ihr Katharina helfen.Durch diese gesamte Tortur ist Katharina unglaublich stark gewesen. Natürlich gab es dunkle Tage. Tage an denen sie sich selbst und uns fragte, warum sie überhaupt überlebt hat. Tage, an denen Sie sich ihr zukünftiges Leben als Behinderte nicht vorstellen kann. Aber meistens ist sie ungemein positiv. Ihre Dankbarkeit am Leben zu sein, ihre Stärke, ihre Entschlossenheit, und ihre positive Einstellung sind inspirierend. Als ihr großer Bruder habe ich sie immer bedingungslos geliebt, jetzt bin ich voller Bewunderung.Kürzlich traf Katharina eine andere Patientin. Eine Frau mittleren Alters, die auch in einem Autounfall verwickelt gewesen war und die Diagnose erhalten hatte, sie werde nie wieder gehen können. Sie geht an einem Rollator. Sie schreibt ihre nahezu wunderhafte Heilung einer privaten Reha-Klinik zu (http://www.zentrum-der-rehabilitation.de). Patienten erhalten dort eine Intensivtherapie von bis zu acht Stunden täglich. “Wunder” werden dort möglich gemacht. Als meine Schwester das hörte, war sie augenblicklich begeistert. Auch nur ein paar Schritte gehen zu können ist alles was sie sich wünscht. Aber, es gibt einen Haken, es ist eine private Einrichtung, die nicht von der Krankenkasse oder Rentenversicherung bezahlt wird. Eine 12-wöchige Therapie kostet € 60.000,-. Als Katharina das erfahren hat, war die Hoffnung ebenso schnell verflogen wie sie gekommen war. Sie kann diese Summe nicht aufbringen. Ich kann diese Summe nicht aufbringen. Aber ich bin überzeugt, dass diese Einrichtung die beste Chance für sie ist und ich bin fest entschlossen alles zu tun was ich nur kann, um ihr diese Therapie zu ermöglichen.Ich weiß viele von Euch sind noch in Studium/Ausbildung oder gerade erst dabei die Karriere zu starten und deshalb nicht in der Lage viel zu spenden, ich verstehe das. Ich will auch nicht, dass irgendjemand an Notersparnisse geht. Ich glaube, dass viele kleine Spenden Großes erreichen können. Wenn Ihr nicht in der Lage seid zu spenden, sendet Katharina Eure positiven Gedanken und Gebete, teilt ihre Geschichte und diesen Link, ich weiß es bedeutet ihr unheimlich viel. UndWorte genügen nicht um auszudrücken, wie dankbar ich für jede einzelne Spende bin.Ich kann mir vorstellen, dass es noch weitere Fragen gibt und ich stehe gerne persönlich per Email oder Telefon zur Verfügung.Falls Ihr spenden möchtet, aber keine Kreditkarte habt, könnt Ihr auch eine Direktüberweisung an folgendes Konto machen:Inhaberin: Katharina NagelIBAN:DE29672800510460735102Dear family, friends, and kind strangers who might have stumbled onto this,I've often joked that all I have are words and all I can do is read and write (I'm a PhD student or as Tyrion Lannister would say 'I drink and I know things'). I've envisioned myself writing a lot of things. I’ve never envisioned myself writing anything like this.Early Sunday morning January 25 2016 I received a FaceTime call from my mom. She didn't even manage to complete her sentence before breaking down in tears. My aunt had to deliver the news. During the previous night my sister, Katharina, had been in a horrible car accident. Katharina was still in surgery when I got the call. At that time the doctors gave her a 50/50 chance of survival.Having lost control of her car she had crashed into a barrier and a traffic sign at the side of the road. Mostly unharmed but severely disoriented, she had exited the vehicle and stumbled back onto the road where she collapsed. Lying unconscious on the road another vehicle drove over her. The driver stopped immediately and called an ambulance.Katharina made it through the 11 hour surgery, but it was too early to tell what the lasting damages would be. It should be the first of six major surgeries she would have over the course of the next four months. She spent a week in an induced coma and many more in the ICU. As I'm writing this she's still in a hospital recovering.When the car rolled over her it crushed and broke her pelvis in multiple places. She further sustained damages to her internal organs, bladder and intestine were ruptured, her lung collapsed, broken ribs and broken vertebrae causing a bleeding that damaged her spinal cord. However, her spinal cord did not rip or tear in any way. This is important. In addition to her initial injuries she sustained stage 3 bed sores.Katharina had multiple surgeries to mend her damaged organs, and stabilise her vertebrae and pelvis. She is now recovering in a hospital in our hometown Heidelberg (Germany) and the doctors are extremely happy with her recovery saying that for the time bing she will not need any further surgeries. The injury to her spinal cord, however, continues to puzzle them. Based on the position of the injury Katharina should not be able to move any of her extremities nor have any sensory functions. Inexplicably, her arms function normally. Just above her belly button her paraplegia starts. Her torso is still very unstable. She has sensory functions in her legs, but she cannot move them.For the last seven weeks Katharina has been doing physiotherapy. When she started she couldn’t build up any tension in her legs. Now when she’s lying in bed and someone puts her leg up in an angle, she is able to build up enough tension to keep the leg from falling to the left or the right. When I last visited her three weeks ago, the day before I returned to England, she was able to move her toes on the right foot a little. Her chances of further recovery are hard to estimate, but this is tremendous progress and far beyond what some of the physios and doctors have predicted. Unfortunately, despite the progress she has shown and continues to show the physios continue to maintain that she will not be able to walk again.After a rough transition to being in a wheelchair, to some extent my sister has now come to terms with it. But she hasn’t accepted it. She does not like not being level with people. She does not like people looking down on her. She dreads the thought of being in public in a wheelchair. She works hard every single day in combination with her physio and on her own. She works physically and mentally. She does everything she can. Of course she knows she’ll never be able to walk normally again. She knows she’ll never be able to run again. BUT she hasn’t given up hope that she will be able to stand, be able to take a few steps, maybe walk with a wheeled walking assistant. I believe she will. I believe she will prove it to everyone. I believe she is strong enough to overcome any obstacle. And if you want you can help her.Throughout this entire ordeal Katharina has been incredible. Of course there have been dark days. Days when she asked why she even survived. But most of the time she is admirably positive. Her gratitude for being alive, her strength, her determination, and her positivity continue to inspire me. I’ve always loved her unconditionally, now I’m in awe of her.Recently Katharina met another patient, a middle-aged woman who after a card accident was also told she would never walk again. She now walks with a wheeledwalking assistant. She attributed her near miraculous recovery to a private rehabilitation clinic (https://www.zentrum-der-rehabilitation.de/en/). Patients there receive high-intensity therapy of up to eight hours a day. They have a proven track record of restoring ‘lost’ capabilities. When my sister heard of this she was immediately excited. Being able to walk even just a few steps is all she hopes for. However, here’s the catch, it’s a private institution, meaning her health insurance does not cover it, and 12 weeks of therapy cost € 60,000.00. When my sister learned this, she was disheartened. There’s just no way she could pay for this. And there’s no way I can pay for it. But together with you, it might just be possible. I’m convinced that this is the best facility and the best chance of regaining mobility, and I’m determined to do anything I can to enable her to do this therapy.I know many of you are still in college or just starting out in their careers and not in a financial position to give, I understand that. I don’t want anyone to break their piggy banks and dip into existential savings. I believe small donations can go a long way. If you’re not in a position to donate, keep Katharina in your thoughts and prayers, share her story and this link, I know it means the world to her. And words cannot express how thankful I am for every single donation.I can imagine that you might have questions and I’m happy to answer them as best as I can via phone or email.Ifyou're experiencing difficulties donating with your credit card (or in case you don't have a credit card), but still want to donate you can donate to this account:Account holder: Katharina NagelIBAN: DE29672800510460735102Read more"

These developmental delays prompted Mitchell and Chrissy to start seeking medical intervention for Colette as they neared her first birthday. However, before they could get any clear explanation or diagnosis, Colette had a prolonged seizure that warranted their current extensive hospital stay. Once admitted to the Children’s Hospital of Michigan, Colette’s seizures continued to be difficult to manage and keep under control. In addition, further investigation was necessary in order to determine the cause of the seizures. On February 20th, Colette was diagnosed with POLG, a mitochondrial disorder that is not curable and rapidly progressive in nature. More specifically, Colette’s symptoms fall within a certain category called Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS). This is one of the more severe conditions associated with uncontrolled seizures, liver failure, possible other vital organ failure and prematurely passing away from this disease. Chrissy and Mitchell are working with multiple PICU doctors, neurology, genetics, PM&R and a pediatrician that specializes in hospice & palliative medicine to help with Colette’s plan of care, treatment goals and quality of life.During Colette's stay at the hospital she has undergone extensive testing, procedures and treatment. Chrissy and Mitchell, along with their amazing hospital staff at the Children's Hospital of Michigan have gone above and beyond to give Colette the best possible care. Chrissy and Mitchell have been essentially living in the hospital, alongside Colette, pouring every minute of their every day into their sweet baby girl. Please join us in supporting the Scheuer family to ensure that the last thing Mitchell and Chrissy be burdened with right now, during this incredibly difficult time, is medical bills.Mitchell and Chrissy are extremely moved by all the support they have received from family and friends over the past month. They ask that you please continue to pray for Colette, and that God be the source of strength in their family right now as they navigate through these very uncertain times.Together, we are #cocostelliestrong.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------The Go Fund Me donation you make today will go towards helping cover any remaining or uncovered insurance costs for the following medical treatments and procedures listed below, as well as costs for any future, continued hospital or at home care Colette may receive.Current medical expenses to date:2 ambulance ridesCountless seizure medications, supplements & vitaminsCT scanMultiple EEGs over the span of several days2 MRIsEye examination2 central line procedures2 intubations & extubationsDaily chest X-rays while intubated in PICUBreathing treatments, steroids & nasal cannula requiredMultiple ultrasound guided peripheral IV line proceduresEchocardiogramSpinal tapKidney ultrasoundAbdominal and pelvic ultrasoundDaily blood, urine and glucose checksUTI treatment, antibiotics & catheterizationsEpilepsy panelGenetic testingEndocrine testingMetabolic testingNutrition consultationsNG tube for feedingsInpatient rehabilitation including PT, OT, speech & recreationalFuture medical expenses:Seizure medications, supplements & vitaminsKeto formulaLab workContinued follow up appointments with specialistsPossible medical procedures or surgeriesAssistive devicesIn home nursing careDonations will also be made to support medical professionals in their research to better understand, identify and treat individuals with POLG.If you would like further information on mitochondrial disorders or Colette’s specific syndrome, please click on the links below.https://www.statpearls.com/ArticleLibrary/viewarticle/17389 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26471/Read more"

He has experienced a severe head injury but to what extent this has impacted his function is not known yet. He has skull fractures on the left side and back of his head as well as one on his first cervical vertebrae (1st neck bone). He has also had issues with his lungs, both of which have collapsed at different times. After two surgeries they were able to close up his open skull fractures, remove a blood clot from the back of his head and insert two chest drains into his lungs. Caleb is now stable and showing positive signs. We are hoping and praying for a full recovery but there is still many unknowns and a long path ahead. So many of you have reached out and asked if you can support Caleb financially and others have already given generously which has led us to set up this fundraising page. We plan for any funds raised to go towards medical bills, rehabilitation and flights to get him back to the UK as soon as he is stable and it is safe to do so. For those that want to give locally in Ethiopia please contact Mercy at [email redacted].Thank you so much for those who have already given and are praying faithfully for Caleb. It really is overwhelming to know how many people are rallying around him. There is a large group of us permanently camped out in the hospital in Addis willing him on.

A curb-side passenger shelter fell on Tierney during the Sunday storm while she was awaiting pick-up at O’Hare Airport. Tierney suffered dislocated vertebrae, a broken rib, and torn muscles, among other injuries. She had surgery to repair the dislocated vertebrae. Surgeons felt this part of surgery was successful.Her injuries are not life-threatening but, unfortunately, it was determined that her spinal cord had been severed. She is paralyzed from waist downward, with no expectation of this ever improving given current medical technology. We will always remain hopeful, however, as we all know that Tierney’s motto is “Never Give Up”.Tierney has always had a fun-loving free spirit with a passion to be creative. Her first passion is dancing. She took pride in the hard work she put in over the years expanding her talent to different styles. From an early age she had aspirations of dancing professionally or owning her own dance studio. Her dancing was beautiful and looked effortlesss - you could not take your eyes off her when she danced. She was simply captivating. This accident caused a defining change for her future. A change that confines her to a wheel chair and away from the dance stage she called life.Funds raised will be donated to help cover costs to help Tierney's quality of life when she returns home from rehabilitation. Funds will help cover some medical costs, but will also be used to help cover costs, encountered by her family, required for modifications and adaptive changes so that Tierney is comfortable when she is able to return home. In addition weask that you help seek justice for Tierney by helping to spread awareness about the condition of the passenger shelters at Chicago O'Hare Airport and demand that O'Hare correct these unsafe conditions so that no other person or family has to endure the pain and long road Tierneyhas ahead of her.Thank you for all your love and support for Tierney and our family.Aug 13 - 2 Investigators: Rusted O’Hare Shelters Remain, After Accident That Paralyzed Woman Aug 14 - Family Sues City After Daughter’s Spine Severed By Falling Pedestrian ShelterRead more"

En voulant raccorder des fils à un panneau électrique, un arc électrique s’est créé et l’a atteint au visage,au thorax et aux bras. Il a donc été transporté d’urgence au CHUM de Montréal à l’unité des Grands brulés. Samuel présentait alors des brûlures sévères sur 45% de son corps. Selon les pronostics des médecins, les chances de survie de Samuel étaient alors presque nulles. Il fut alors intubé et mis dans un coma artificiel où il le restera pendant 74 longues journées.Au moment de l’accident et lors de son transport en ambulance, Samuel a eu le temps de voir ses blessures. Il était alors déterminé à se battre et à lutter pour sa vie. Pour lui, il n’était pas question de mourir sans parler à sa conjointe Vanessa, à sa mère et à toute sa famille. Il a même prononcé ces mots justeavant son intubation: « Je vais survivre ! ».Pendant plusieurs jours, l’équipe du CHUM pensait que Sam ne passerait pas au travers et qu’il perdrait probablement sa bataille.Mais, c’est bien mal connaitre le battant qu’il est car après les soins intensifs, le coma, de sa mise sous respirateur, d’une trachéotomie, de ses multiples chirurgies, de ses greffes et surtout de toutes ses souffrances, Samuel est maintenant hors de danger. Il a gagné la bataille de sa vie.Cependant, la guerre est loin d’être gagnée. Il a dû subir une reconstruction de la peau de son crânes, ses oreilles, son visage, son cou, ses bras et de ses mains.Psychologiquement, il est confronté à une nouvelle réalité qui sera celle d’apprendre à vivre avec son nouveau corps.Débute alors un marathon vers laguérison qui s’avère long et laborieux. Il a été en réadaptation à VillaMedica, un centre de réadaptation pour les grands brûlés, du 18 décembre 2020 au 22 janvier 2021Sam doit maintenant réapprendre à sourire, à manger, à marcher, à développer sa dextérité manuelle, à se lever, à se coucher et plus encore. Il doit faire de multiples efforts pour réhabiliter les fonctions de son corps. Physiothérapie, ergothérapie, plasticiens, massothérapeutes, médecins, etc. font maintenant partie de la réalité de Samuel et de sa conjointe et ce encore pour plusieurs années. Ils serontconcentrés uniquement à sa réhabilitation complète afin de retrouver une vie plus normale, et ce, le plus vite possible. Il est très résilient et positif. Il travaille fort et chaque réussite est une énorme victoire.Bien-sûr, toute cette nouvelle réalité a un coût humain inestimable mais malheureusement aussi des coûts financiers. Samuel sera en invalidité pour plusieurs moiset sa conjointe a dû laisser son emploi pour l’accompagner et le soutenir. C’est pourquoi, la famille sollicite votre aide afin d’alléger le fardeau financier de Samuelpour qu’il puisse se concentrer sur ce qui est le plus important c’est-à-die sa réhabilitation. Il aura besoin entre autres de nouvelles chirurgies, de chirurgies aux laser (non-couvertes), d’unlit adapté, de plusieurs meubles adaptés dont un fauteuil confortable pour les nuits où Sam ne pourra rester allongé, etc.Sam, Vanessa, ses parents et sa famille sont touchés par l’impressionnante vague de soutien et de générosité qu’ils reçoivent. Les paroles aimables de soutien ont grandement aidé la famille àtraverser une partie de cette épreuve et à garder le moral pendant cette période difficile.

My name is Marc Fort, and I work at the Texas Music Office in Austin, TX. Like many Austinites, fans of Texas music, and lovers of music around the country, I was heartbroken to learn of the tragic accident that happened last week to the Austin-based band, Porter & the Bluebonnet Rattlesnakes.On Wednesday, October 19, 2016 in North Carolina, Adam Nurre and his bandmates Chris Porter and Mitchell Vandenburgwere stopped in traffic on Interstate 95 when a tractortrailer truck crashed into their touring vehicle, taking the life of Adam's bandmates, Chris Porter and Mitchell Vandenburg.
Miraculously, Adam survived the accident. He is confined to a wheelchair for 2 weeks, then he faces a long road of physical therapy and rehabilitation in order to get back to his life of performing and teaching music full time.
Through meeting Adam via my work at the Texas Music Office, I've learned that he is not only an incredible musician, but a gracious, stand-up guy that is beloved by the Austin music community and beyond.I've recently helped Adam get in touch with & utilize the Health Alliance for Austin Musicians, and the SIMS Foundation. Later, I was suprised to learn that no one had set up a GoFundMe account for Adam, something that he would never do for himself, or ask anyone to do.My hope is that through donations, our community can come together and help Adam fill the donut-hole in his medical insurance coverage, as well as help him with the lost income that he will suffer during his months of rehabilitation.You can learn more about the unfathomable accident here: http://music.blog.austin360.com/2016/10/20/two-austin-musicians-killed-in-car-crash-on-tour/.
And you can learn more about Adam and his life as a musician and music educator here:http://www.adamnurre.com/.
I'd also like to note that when I approached Adam about the idea of setting up a GoFundMe account for him, he immediately suggested that funds from the account be also donated to the surviving families of his bandmates, Chris and Mitchell. I concurred with Adam, knowing how exepsnive funeral expenses are these days.
So Adam will be splitting all donations 3 ways with the parents/surviving family members of his deceased bandmates.
Thank you in advance...to everyone...for coming together to help lift up our fellow musician and Chris and Mitchell's family during this incredibly difficult time.Read more"

Any action you take may be able to solve this family's problem. 27-year-old Dmitry is a schoolteacher, is married and has one son, with another on the way.He does everything for his family, but hisright leg is missing. Dmitry lost his leg when he was not even two years old. His family lived in the village of Neftegorsk on the island of Sakhalin, Russia. On the night of May 28, 1995, a strong earthquake occurred, which took the lives of many people, including his mom, dad and brother Ivan. Dmitry was buried under the rubble, but miraculously found 7 days later. His condition was critical, his right leg was almost crushed by the slab that had pinned him. Dust and other dirt were drained from his lungs. Dmitry was flown to the nearest city to get medical help. As the flight took a several hours, doctors put an emergency tourniquet on his leg, much higher than the injury. At the hospital, it was decided to amputate Dmitry’s leg, as blood poisoning had already begun. The amputation left him with only 7 cm of bone.Dmitry was raised by his aunt (she is the one holding Dmitry at the moment when he was found). The first prosthesis was put on Dmitry at the age of 5 in the Moscow center, at the region's expense.But since the length of the bone was only 7 cm, it was very difficult to wear a prosthesis, and walking was nearly impossible. It was then decided to perform an operation to lengthen the bone. After several consultations at Russian centers of trauma and orthopedics, no guarantee could be given that an operation would be successful, due to the weak state of his organism. Then they came upon information about a certain foundation in Moscow, which organized surgeries at a Shriner’s Hospital in Los Angeles. Dmitry’s history was sent to the Shriner’s Hospital, and Dr. Anthony Scaduto, a Shriner’s surgeon, agreed to perform an operation to lengthen the bone. Dmitry’s caretaker, his aunt, couldn't miss such opportunity and did everything to make it possible. At the end of 2008 she flew with him to LA and on the 6th day of their arrival to the US an operation was performed. Dmitry was fitted with a good prosthesis with an external power source from Otto bock. Dmitry felt happy. But time came to replace the prosthesis. He began to try to get it from the state through rehabilitation programs, since he had proof that should be able to receive help. But all that he was told, was that there were no funds, or that he doesn't have the right forms, and then that he has to have some certificates that are not related to prosthetics. Typical bureaucracy.Last year Dmitry had to get a new prosthesis, but this did not happen. He started having problems with skin on the stump, back problems, problems with walking, as well as the safety of walking. He even tried to build a prosthesis on his own, as they are so very expensive...Please help in the purchase of a new prosthesis for Dmitry.Please, help him to walk again!

Hello my name is Angela and I am Shannon Beauregard’soldest sister.The reason for this fundraiser is to ask for  help and support for my sister. She was in   season ending accident at Century Mile race track on September 18, 2020.Shannon was in the third race almost at the finish line, leading by 3 horse lengths. Her horse went down. She was thrown and run over by the oncoming horse.Sustainingmultiple injuries. Shattering her pelvis,     breaking her tailbone and breaking her hip.She was rushed to the hospital. It took 4 days for the surgical team oforthopaedic surgeons and a pelvic specialist to operate. The surgery did not go as planned. They were not able to use screws as her bones were too small. Electing to use a “Halo” system instead to hold her           together. They inserted metal rods into either side of her hip from the outside of her body. A large screw was     placed in the back of her pelvis.



She is suffering and in excruciating pain.   Thedoctors are working very hard to       control or manageher pain. She has doses of pain  medication available every 6 mins.She will not even be able to consider        looking at the possibility of walking again   for a minimum of at least three months.Shannon will inevitably require being admitted into a rehabilitation Center. The road to recovery will be extremely long, difficult and financially taxing.Shannon will be unable to care for herself, work or support herself for an              undetermined period of time. She will require financial assistance and     support in many areassuch as;Rehabilitation and equipment costs,loss of income, insurance fees,medical fees,transportation, physiological therapy, living expenses (Rent, food.....etc.)Shannon has a heart of gold. She is kind hearted, loving and a very         considerate woman.Always thinking of    others. Helping in any way she can. One of her favourite memories, was when she was   able to help a very ill little girl, realize her  dream to meet “Shannon Beauregard a girl jockey” through a “Wish Foundation”. They spent a wonderful and memorable day   together at the race track.

Shannon has a passion for horses and       racing them. She becomes one with the    horse when she rides. Shannon has been   living her dream racing and riding horses.Shannon has shown so much support in the racing community.I am asking for your help and financial      support at this time of need.

It would be greatly appreciated.Every dollar counts.No amount is too small wether it be 5$ or 20$.To help get the word out kindly share this.  “GoFundMe” Fundraiser on your Facebook timeline. As well as any other social media networks or platforms.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart, in advance for your love and support.

He was placed in a medically induced coma to allow his brain to repair and recover from such a severe trauma. 

For the next 3 weeks, Kev remained in a coma and medical staff gave him a less that 1% chance of survival. But Kev put up one hell of a fight and slowly regained consciousness. After a further 2 weeks, through hard work and determination Kev was stable enough to be transferred back to St. Vincent's Hospital. 

At an already difficult time, Kev and his family were dealt another blow as the Covid19 pandemic was declared and the country went into lock-down. This meant that while Kev was struggling to recover, his main support system of his wife Emma, their 3 children Toby, Kealen and Robyn and all his family and friends was restricted. The only way to communicate was through face time aided by the ever-helpful nursing staff. Which means Kev hasn’t seen his 3 children since March. 

On the 18th of May, Kev's improvements were such that he was ready to be moved to the National Rehabilitation Hospital. Here he will undergo months of intensive, carefully planned therapy, in order to allow him to regain use of his left-hand side & learn to walk again. All with the goal of bringing him back home to reunite with his family. 

This is where we need your help!! We hope to have Kev home by August, but in order to do this, his family will need to carry out massive modifications to their home. From wheelchair accessible hallways / doors to stair lifts to modified bath and bedroom facilities.

All funds raised will be sent directly, through the Gofundme platform, to Kev's wife Emma to allow her to begin these works. We would appreciate all the help you can give, with no donation too small. 

Thanksfor all you help.

My iban & bank details are at the end of this story.Hello, my name is Mark Gilligan. I am a 54-year-old Irish musician. In 2003 I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (remittance relapsing form). As time progressed it worsened, and I am now in the secondary progressive stage of the disease. I have basically lost the use of my whole left-hand side of my body. My hand (I´m left-handed) and leg don´t function properly. So, I can´t play music anymore which is a right pain as you can imagine. I was a clarinet player since I was 13. But never mind that, it is the stupid little daily things that we don´t even give a second thought to like tying shoelaces or buttering a slice of bread to shaving yourself or brushing your teeth. And I haven´t even started to dress myself yet. Trying to put my socks on with one hand. That gets me most frustrated as does having to ask my wife (Willemiek and our kids (Tristan 20 & Orla 16) to open a bag of crisps or cut my beef burger up into ¨little soldiers¨. Shortly our son Tristan will be moving out to study. As a father you’d be the first to help him out by moving his stuff, painting etc. But this father won´t be able to do any of this and realistically will have to look at photos because I can´t climb stairs to see his place.The last 2 months I spent in rehabilitation learning how to fall safely because I fall a lot tripping over rugs & door saddles or just losing my balance. I have kind of got to the stage of my life where my world is getting smaller and smaller and MS is progressing at a rapid rate. In a kind of a way I am very lucky that I don´t get depressed and always seem to find a manageable solution when MS throws you a curve. It´s hard at times accepting how aggressive MS can be especially in the secondary progressive stage. Once you´ve lost the use of as in my case the left-hand side the chances are it won't come back. Until now.....Here in The Netherlands where I live there is very little they can do medically and as my neurologist said to me about 3 years ago that my rehabilitation doctor is my new best friend. However recently I met a doctor, a GP who also had secondary progressive MS, who had a procedure called HSCT done nearly 2 years ago. MS has stopped progressing and he has a huge improvement in his lifestyle. His recommendation was for me to get this done yesterday and not next week. HSCT attempts to “reboot” the immune system, which is responsible for damaging the brain and spinal cord in MS. This treatment has shown very positive results in stopping MS in its tracks. This treatment is not available in The Netherlands and because it is considered to be at an experimental stage, and it is not covered by my health insurance. It comes with a price tag. It is recommended that I get this done at The A.A. Maximov Department of Hematology and Cellular Therapy in Moscow. In total this costs 75.000 euros. This will cover the stem cell transplant treatment, carer, all medical costs incurred, aftercare and travel costs.This is why I am starting a crowd funding campaign to get this treatment done. Since that day back in 2003 when I was first diagnosed with MS, I called it ¨The lodger inside of me¨ and I think it has overstayed its welcome and needs to be evicted. If you were to see me today, you’d be going ¨Ah jaysis the poor auld unfortunate¨.... But I don´t see it that way and if the is a sniff of a chance that I can evict the lodger I´m doing it. I accept the way I am now, but I must stop its progression. Period. Could you imagine Willemiek, Tristan & Orla having a Daddy who can hang out with them & have fun without thinking oh will Mark be able for this.Will you donate today and help set me on my journey to halt MS. I intend to keep a weekly video blog to keep you all updated on this extreme trip of a lifetime.I intend to keep a weekly video blog and other fun things to keep you all updated on this extreme trip of a lifetime. I'll be tweeting #evictmarksms. I'll be Facebooking, etc. I have an email address if anyone wants to contact me [email redacted]Amazinly I started my stem cell transplant in Moscow on the 19th Febuary 2020 and spent a total of 32 days in hospital there. On returning to The Netherlands I spent 2 and a half months in solitary confinment in a nursing home. Today I am 9 months post HSCT and it is unbelievable what I have achieved. Folks this has stopped the progression of MS in its tracks. The bonus is I can walk, write, drive, shower, shave, dress myself, cut and butter the bread. You think thats good? Well guess what? Tristan & Orla got their Daddy back and Willemiek got her husband back. And me well I got control of my life back.............That's my story.

Her first birthday pictures are filled with fat-lip smiles from a tumble the day before. She potty trained herself at 18 months. She had a hematoma in her ear from a fall when she was around 2. An adrenaline junkie at the park, around 3 years old, she begged for me to push her super high on the swings. She lost her grip and did a complete flip off the swing, landing in my arms as I stood (thankfully) underneath her. She learned how to ride a bike with no training wheels on the first ride. She did a flip on the bars a couple weeks into kindergarten and fell flat on her back, got up and went into class when the bell rang.That’s why, on December 23, 2015, when she did a bridge (a backbend where you push yourself up from the floor) on our living room floor and then collapsed crying, I shook it off. When she cried that her legs, back and hips hurt, I gathered her in my arms and rocked her, shushing her, telling her to calm down.But this time, Eden didn’t pick herself up off the ground, dust herself off and go on her next crazy adventure. Thirty minutes after she started crying, she stopped. Her face changed—it kind of filled with wonder—and she told me, “Mom, I feel like my feet are sleeping.” I looked at her body, which seemed to be posed awkwardly on the bed, and told her to move her leg. She stared at it, saying, “I can’t, Mom.”I put her and her sister in the car and rushed to the hospital, a day that started her 52-day stay in the hospital where we learned that that backbend turned our independent daredevil into a paraplegic. That backbend, something she had done hundreds of times before, had hyperextended her spine and caused the artery that feeds her spinal cord to stop pumping blood, causing a stroke in her spinal cord. The extent of damage is unheard of. Her stroke was in T8/9, she stretched the ligaments in T3/4, and the damage extends up and down her spinal cord from T2-T12.In one instant, that backbend altered our lives forever. Eden is now in a wheelchair. She lost the ability to sit up on her own. Her bowels and bladder do not work. We have to wake up twice a night to move her so she won’t get pressure sores from sleeping in one position too long. She also must remember to do pressure relief exercises every fifteen minutes she is in her wheelchair to protect her skin. She cannot regulate her temperature so we have to watch her for signs of her getting too hot or too cold. She cannot reach a sink to wash her hands or brush her teeth. Our bathrooms are not equipped for her to easily shower or bathe. The list of what she now cannot do could span pages.But what that backbend hasn’t done is take away Eden’s spirit. Her physical therapist, two days after meeting her at acute rehab, nicknamed her, “Daredevil Eden.” Her therapy team said she accomplished more in two weeks of rehab than most kids accomplish in six. Her current PT, the first time she treated Eden at the house, said most kids quit after ten minutes of therapy, but she kept pushing Eden for over an hour because Eden never complained. Eden started back at school one week after she was discharged from the hospital—less than 2 months after being admitted to the ICU where she was hooked up to machines in every way possible.Because of Eden’s spirit and resiliency, we have never lost hope in her full recovery. Anyone who encounters Eden, including doctors, nurses and therapists always have the same response: “If anyone can recover from this, it’s Eden.”Eden is going to Kennedy Krieger in Baltimore in April for two weeks of intense physical therapy. After that, she will go to Frazier Rehab in Louisville for three months of locomotor training. Although walking is our ultimate goal for Eden, we have more than the end goal in mind with these therapies. 90% of children with spinal cord injuries before age ten develop scoliosis later on in life. If she does not start standing, her bones will become weak and brittle and she will develop osteoporosis and could break a bone with the lightest tap. Her kidneys are at risk, and she could develop arthritis. These therapies may also help regenerate her bowel and bladder functions and bring back sensation to her lower body. These therapies will also provide what we all need most of all: Hope.                                         - Kylee Hoelscher, Eden's motherEden is five. She did a backbend on her living room floor and is now paralyzed from the waist down. But her story will not end here. We will do anything and everything possible to help her recover. Eden cannot stand on her own, so now we will Stand For Eden and we ask you to join us.It is our goal to raise funds to assist the Hoelscher family (Nic, Kylee and sister Isabella, age 9) through this extremely challenging time.

After my father died, she worked harder than ever to keep the family going.In 2009 she was diagnosed with Osteoarthritis and went through six interventions. Even though she was glued to the bed, she kept working from home and never gave up.Now, because of the situation of Venezuela, the country I was born and raised, we made a family decision for me to find better ways in UK but my mom and husband had to stay at home for now.My mom after six years of stable recovery had an accident at home. She fell and suffered a major fracture in the left leg and a dislocation on the right leg. During hospital admission, they found an infection and my husband was told that her immediate intervention needed to be postponed.Now, she needs to wait for everything to stabilize before the surgery. They need to change the hip replacement she had and do an internal fixation.After that intervention, they will need to admit her in again to repair the dislocation. And on top of that, post-surgery rehabilitation.We have managed thanks to friends and some savings to pay initial expenses, but we still have a long way to go, and her medical insurance only covered 6.000.000 Bss (that represents less than $40). Overall, we need $15.000,00 to cover surgeries, medicines, and rehabilitation. And we need it as soon as possible. The longer we wait, the higher the risk for new infections and muscular atrophies.I thank you with all my heart for all the help you can give us. My family will highly appreciate it.Read more"

I want to protect her personal privacy during this time and not go into detail about the accident and the horrific injuries and experience she went through. We all know she is a strong fighter and she will get through this. We have the best doctors and staff working on her and giving us updates when they can. As of today 2/3 at 7:30 AM they were able to take out her breathing tube and she survived brain surgery. As of now, she is able to follow commands in all 4 extremities with good strength. The fact that she was able to follow commands, speak, and write on a piece of paper is a miracle itself. We are overwhelmed by all of the love and support we have seen for Kelsey and our family during this time. Visitation is very limited during this time and Vanderbilt only allows a certain number of immediate family to see for only an hour a day, every 24 hours. She is still in the trauma unit and will stay there for a couple of days while they closely monitor her progress. Our first request for Kelsey are prayers/thoughts she will be able to make a full recovery. As a family we have to make decisions and think about her life when she is discharged from the hospital. This could take days, weeks, or even months but if you feel called to donate, any amount is so greatly appreciated. I will honor and promise to you every dollar amount donated will go directly to Kelsey, her medical bills, rehabilitation, and post hospital/home care. We all love and appreciate her support.

He stepped out of the car, collapsed and became paralysed, terrifying his frantic family. Rob was airlifted to Townsville Hospital and placed in intensive care. Doctors discovered he had a very rare bleed on the brain.Rob is a fighter and his condition is slowly improving, but there is a long and uncertain road ahead.

Jonny was rushed to Cavan Hospital and the air ambulance was cancelled as the Paramedic team didn’t think he would even make it to Cavan Hospital never mind Beaumont Hospital but thankfully he did, the medical team in Cavan managed to stabilize Jonny and prepared him for the journey to Beaumont.When he reached Beaumont, the doctors had already reviewed his CT scan from Cavan and their initial assumption was that they weren’t going to be able to even operate on Jonny as the injury he had sustained was so bad, but thankfully when the Neurosurgeon looked into Jonathan’s eye in that split second his pupil flickered which indicated there was some brain activity and they decided to operate on Jonny.We were then taken into a relative’s room and told that the likelihood of Jonny making it to midnight was very slim. To receive news like this is so hard to express in words, it feels like all your worst nightmares are coming true and that it can’t be real because we were only joking and chatting with Jonny a few hours earlier but even after being told something like this, we all still truly believed that Jonny would pull through, we knew he was a fighter and we knew we had to stay positive for Jonny and pray for a miracle that he would make it through the night and we are so very thankful that he did.The outlook that the medical team gave us for Jonny wasn’t positive at all, they advised that he may be in a coma for a long period of time and that if he came out of it he may require long term support in order to breathe, that he could go into cardiac arrest or be left in a vegetated state, that he would most likely be fed through a tub for the rest of his life, that he wouldn’t regain movement in his body and that Jonny most likely would never ever speak or understand speech because that part of the brain was completely gone.Two weeks after the accident Jonny came off the ventilator and was put on a tracheostomy and then to everyone’s surprise, three days later Jonny started to breathe on his on, this was the first massive step into Jonny’s recovery. Shortly after, Jonny opened his eyes and then he spoke for the first time, we got to facetime Jonny that day and to hear him speak and hear his voice after so many weeks was just absolutely incredible, we asked him how are feeling and his reply was ‘I’m not so bad, how’s yourself’ and we all just cried with happiness, it was absolutely amazing.Fast forward a couple of weeks and Jonny was transferred to Cavan Hospital and then on to Monaghan Rehabilitation Hospital where he is currently undergoing physiotherapy, speech and language and occupational therapy. Jonny is having his Cranioplasty surgery on the 20th of October and we believe this will be the start of the next chapter in his recovery. He is then planned to go to the NRH in Dun Laoghaire for intense rehabilitation. Jonny has a long road ahead of him, but his drive and determination will get him through the remainder of his recovery. Jonny hasn’t got full movement on his right side yet and he has yet to regain his eyesight back. We believe through positivity and prayers that Jonny will make a full recovery and will continue to defy every odd.Jonny is very focused on coming back home and one day hopes to return to his job as a Civil Engineer in Dublin. We are required to make changes to our house and build an extension suitable for Jonny’s needs and purchase any equipment that is required for Jonny, with that there are huge costs involved.

On the 20th of April, my brother Mitchell and his wife Ashle received the devastating news that their eldest son, Flynn, who’s only lived a short 7 years has a cancerous tumour - epitheloid sarcoma on the side of his right hand.

This particular type of sarcoma is extremely rare, and because it is rarely painful and typically only noticeable too late it’s rate of mortality is extremely high. The most successful treatment, known to cure this type of cancer is “wide Excision” of the tumour itself - so long as it has not spread.

After numerous scans and a further biopsy and removal of one lymph node, Flynn’s surgeons and senior medical officers are confident that removal of his right pinky and ring finger and right side of his hand and wrist will save his life.This news is amazing, and gives us full hearts and hope that it was found, diagnosed and can be treated before it spreads further and are so thankful that he has been given the best case news and prognosis to be able to live a long, healthy and happy life.But the removal of a fair portion of his predominant hand does not come without its own challenges, a minimum of a week long stay in hospital, ongoing rehabilitation depending on how well his hand heals and recovers and long term rehabilitation to ensure that he can learn to continue to use his first three fingers for as many or all of tasks that he might need throughout the future. He will also have to have frequent scans and visits to the hospital for further checks to ensure that thisaggressive cancer does not return - most likely until he is an adult and beyond.

In addition to this, the cost of travelling (they live 45 minutes minimum from the hospital), accommodation, food, hospital parking and coordinating and supporting Flynn’s 2 younger siblings, Willow and Vincent as well as enabling Mitchell to continue to work as much as he can as the sole income earner of the family at present is front of mind as they embark on this pathway to a new normal.

Any amount you might be able to contribute to help make meal times, travel, hospital and rehabilitation costs easier will gratefully received by this young and courageous family. Well wishes, love, positive thoughts and any other support you can provide will also help them on their way. As an Aunty, a parent, a family member, a friend, this shock news has really rocked us all, and so if you have made it this far into Flynn’s story make sure to hug those you love a little tighter today.

As time goes on we will continue to provide updates on Flynn’s surgery and rehabilitation plan so that you can keep up to date with his progress.

Care Facility gave family very short notice that her insurance ran out, requiring out of pocket expenses, or to relocate Merry May today Thursday March 26th at noon.... UPDATE... Nursing Home has been and continues to appeal to insurance company to do the right thing to approve and extend coverage given the healing process will take time. If there is any emergency funding to extend care longer, to protect and continue quarantine, that would be appreciated as well. Thank you, thank you, everyone who has been donating, sharing, and making this go viral, none as deserving a miracle as Merry May. Today we have seen a miracle, many helpers who have given Merry hope in this time of healing.

Please join with me, match my donation if you can, make a small one if you can, this truly could be a matter of life or death with the virus on the rampage.With Coronavirus and with short notice, it places Merry in a very vulnerable position. We are trying to get the facility to add a measure of commonsense as many places are on lockdown. Merry, is caught in the middle and needs our help. Merry has inspired me and many over the past years- yet silently has weathered much adversity. Merry's sister Marcy will oversee contributions, but I volunteered to set this up and will lead off with a contribution and a challenge for all who see this to make an contribution you can. It's been humbling to watch this go viral.

Now is not the time to try and re-home someone in her medical condition. She is in California and many places are on lockdown.   

#Mark #FightForMerryMay #GoodWoman #NeedingHelp

The following is a summary of the medical / cost challenges Merry has been facing shared by her sister Marcy.

----- On February 5, 2020 Merry accidentally fell down a long flight of stairs, landing on a hard tile floor at the bottom of the stairs. She was found unconscious and taken by ambulance to a hospital where she spent several days in ICU under close observation for brain surgery. Thankfully, she has (so far!) been able to avoid surgery. She’s lucky to be alive, with no expected permanent paralysis or long term brain damage,  but she is still suffering greatly due to the multiple injuries from the fall and the projected recovery time. These are her major injuries:  Skull fractures (2)  Brain bleed  (hopefully healing, but still being watched for possible surgery) Fractured neck bones (2) Fractures lower back/spine (2) Broken wrist Fractured sternum Broken clavicle Eye orbital fractures (2) Broken ribs (5) Extreme impact/bruising on legs, hips, shoulders, and feet  Doctors have estimated that Merry's recovery time will be 4-6 months. Just how complete her recovery will be is still unknown. A few weeks ago  she was transferred to an excellent skilled nursing facility with 24 hour observation, support, and continued rehabilitation treatment. For the past couple of weeks she, and all patients in the facility, have been under quarantine orders, with no visitors allowed. The strict measures seem to be working, and Merry so far has no signs of COVID-19 infection. That is especially important, not only because or her serious injuries, but because of her age (64) and her pre-existing diabetes and ulcerative colitis. She is considered very high risk for COVID-19. Everyone agrees - her doctors, her caregivers, and her family - that keeping Merry where she is for at least another month, perhaps two is the very best option for her.  Unfortunately, her health insurance will no longer cover her stay at the skilled nursing facility, and her fragile health condition makes moving her to a different facility at this time not only unwise, but potentially fatal. The best, and least expensive option is to keep her where she is but move her to an ""assisted living"" unit within the facility, which is less costly than 24-hour skilled nursing.   In addition to her horrible accident and injuries, Merry was laid off from work last November and has been getting by with only disability payments since then. She has no way to pay her $4500 health insurance (Cobra) deductible that is already due OR one, perhaps two more months at her current facility with a 30-day cost (at the least expensive shared room price) of $4903, due immediately. Her immediate family members are not able to help her financially at this time given the 24 hour notice but are confident that they will be able to provide the support she needs going forward, once she is able to at least walk and handle more independently her basic hygiene, medication, and feeding tasks.    Thank you, thank you -- for any amount you can contribute.  And please look often for ""A Merry Thought"" to be posted regularly on this fundraising site - a reminder that Merry is still hoping and praying to recover completely and be able to again share happy, hopeful thoughts with others.""Merry May has lived true to her ""happy"" name throughout her life, and many people have been touched over the years by the uplifting messages she has shared on Facebook and beyond, titled simply ""A Merry Thought."" https://www.facebook.com/aMerryThought/

She's now experiencing some difficult financial challenges and urgently need help raising funds to pay these unexpected and critical health care costs that her insurance won't cover, so she can stay safe for the next 60 days, then with hope she will be well enough to move out and the virus implications will have passed.  ---------  

A COST ESTIMATE FROM BROOKDALE:  Below is a breakdown of costs for Merry. Option 1 is for a private room, Option 2 for a shared room. I’ve attached an E-brochure which includes floor plans and list of services and amenities.  I’m aware you have concerns about cost, but keep in mind our community is month to month. Within the first 90 days living at our community Merry may cancel anytime, only after 90 days will we require a 30 day notice. With the looming restrictions of COVID-19 and obvious risks. Merry can make a safe and fluid transition to our Assisted Living and be kept safe from the Virus in the meantime, while other alternatives can be arranged.   30 DAY COSTS NOTED BELOWOption 1, Room 261  Rent: $3995 Care: $423 (Escort/Transfer Assist & Assist with showering 2x weekly) One-time community fee: $1000 Total: $5418, due at signing.Option 2, Room 228A Rent: $3480 Care: $423 (Escort/Transfer Assist & Assist with showering 2x weekly)  One-time community fee: $1000 Total: $4903, due at signing.    -----

The funds generated would provide Merry May 60-90 days at this facility and for her to make her Cobra payment for ongoing insurance helps.

Your generosity and compassion are appreciated at this challenging.

His mom and dad, Carlos and Julie, took him to CHEO because of issues with his balance. An MRI discovered a large brain tumour at the back of his head. Over the next four days, he underwent two back-to-back 24 hour long surgeries, over 48 hours under anesthesia, followed by three weeks on a respirator, along with a flurry of scans and other minor surgeries. He came out of ICU just in time to start a course of 30 days of radiation, which must be done within one month of the surgery. Following radiation, he undertook a course of six chemotherapy treatments; he has completed two of those to date.Julie and Carlos recently posted this update to their Facebook account:Brain cancer is about as serious as it gets, yet, Callum’s recovery is even more difficult. He is among the 25% of patients who suffer from Posterior Fossa Syndrome, which means that it will take him much longer to regain his abilities. Once he was able to breathe on his own, he had to learn to do everything again. In the weeks after coming out of the ICU, as he was undergoing radiation, he was gradually able to open his eyes, to move his head, lift one arm, then the other. He has had to fight for every bit of progress. He has since learned to sit up for extended periods of time with assistance, and is now practicing assisted standing several times a day. It took three months after his surgery before he was finally able to make a sound with his voice. A few days later, he said his first word. “UNO!” when his sister forgot to call it out during a game. Many others followed quickly thereafter.July 10, 2020 - ""Loki"" joins the familyHe started practicing swallowing, first jello, then fruit sauce. Within a few days, he was chewing Cheerios, one at a time. Now, he eats many regular foods, although most of his nutrition still comes through his gastric tube. And he speaks all the time, even if his speech is still slow and slurred. Carlos and Julie soon learned to celebrate every one of these steps forward as great victories.And through all of this, Callum’s sense of humour is always shining through, and his special gift to make people laugh. He still loves comic books and super heroes, and is eager to get back to play with his friends again.Callum and Avery - 2019Callum is fortunate in many ways. He has an amazing family: Carlos and Julie. There are no words to describe what they have been through with him, over the last months, being there with him and for him every moment and at every step. He is also a lucky big brother, by one whole minute, to twin sister, Avery, who has been, and continues to be, Callum’s greatest cheerleader. Their extended family has gathered around them and is supporting them in every way they can.Callum is showing great courage and determination. He has made remarkable progress with his physio and speech therapy, but he still has a very long way to go, and this is where he and his family need help. Callum will need specialized rehabilitation supports for years beyond the end of his chemotherapy. We are extremely fortunate to live in a country with a universal health care system, however, it will not cover many of the future costs. At this stage, we estimate that he will need a minimum of two sessions of physiotherapy, speech therapy and tutoring per week, to make his way back to full health and ability. The cost for this level of support is upward of $25,000 for a single year. He also needs special feeding formula, which is still delivered through a feeding tube, there have been costs to install a ramp at home, for a specialized wheelchair, and so many other things that we would never think of, unless one has been in such a situation.June 30th, 2020While there has been some relief from extended health care, Julie’s coverage is now in doubt as she has had to take an extended leave from her work to care for Callum.Carlos and Julie are a kind, compassionate and generous couple. We first met them and their seven-year-old twins Callum and Avery in 2017, when our daughters shared the same JK class. Our children became fast friends, as did all of the parents. As the children grew closer, the parents did too. They are a fun loving family and we have had many wonderful times together. We also know that they are no stranger to trauma. In 2012, before welcoming Callum and Avery into their lives, Julie and Carlos lost their first son, Miles, to a heart defect at the age of 3 months. In the face of such inconceivably difficult circumstances, Carlos and Julie have always been strong and shown great courage and grace.Your generosity during this sweet family's most trying times is greatly appreciated.

April 11, 2020Dear Friends,Thank you for all the support and prayers for Suresh and his family during their tough times. Suresh has survived the brain stroke but the damage to his brain has resulted him being right paralyzed with accompanied loss of speech that challenges him from leading a normal life.Ever since he joined rehabilitation at Craig’s hospital,CO in April 2020, he has been showing promising signs of improvement which gives us hope that we can bring him to some level of normalcy and help him begin a new life.After the month of May 2020, he will be an outpatient and needs to continue the rehabilitation for minimum of 1 year. Doctors have suggested that during this period he will have visit the hospital thrice a week. To continue his treatment, We still need to support him financially. As mentioned earlier the contributions are being used towards his treatment and daily needs of his family. We foresee more expenses during the outpatient rehabilitation and look forward to your support.Any help is really appreciated and will be helpful to his family to continue his treatment. Please do keep praying for his speedy recovery.Thanks,Cyril

March 5,2020:Dear Gofundme Community Friends,We need your help!!Suresh Janardhanan is a young (32 years old) newly married beloved husband, son, brother and awesome friend.On Tuesday 02/25/2020 Suresh’s life took a terribly tragic turn with a massive stroke caused by blood clot in his left brain resulting in paralysis of the right side of the body with accompanied speech loss.He had undergone Cerebral Angioplasty to remove the clot. Post the procedure his condition deteriorated due to severe pressure caused by the cerebral edema. Then he underwent a brain surgery to remove part of the skull to relieve the pressure caused by the edemaHe is currently in the critical care of the hospital undergoing intensive medical treatment and will have to be in Intensive care unit (ICU) with an unknow time of discharge.Suresh is a cheerful and helping person who never ceases to walk the extra mile to help anybody. He got married to Janani 4 months back, she is new to the United States of America and a home maker.This incident and subsequent medical care for Suresh will take a severe financial toll on his family since he is the only bread winner.We need your help to support Suresh in his long journey to recovery. Your contribution will go towards the medical expenses, housing, transportation and food for the family.We do not know how much the financial bills would look like on a longer run and hope you will be a part of his road to recovery. We will post regular updates here. Any help would be deeply appreciated by Suresh and his family.The beneficiary of this campaign is his wife JananiThank you!

She is an energetic, fun-loving teen who has been through so much and yet still keeps a smile on her face. Kareilys was diagnosed with a rare brain disorder called Arnold Chiari Malformation. Chiari Malformation is a serious neurological disorder where the bottom part of the brain herniates downward out of the base of the skull causing the spinal cord to be crowded, which puts pressure on the brain and spine and causes many disabling symptoms. Specifically, Kareilys is beginning to lose her sight, balance, and muscle strength. She is also experiencing loss of consciousness and suffers from extreme headaches.Kareilys’s brain surgery for her Chiari Malformation is very complex and is currently unable to be performed by the doctors in her home country of Cuba. Luckily, Kareilys was granted a Humanitarian Visa, which is allowing her and her mother to fly to Miami, FL to meet with the doctors at the Division of Neurosurgery at the University of Miami Hospital via UHealth International for evaluation and surgical plan. The coordinators and doctors have advised her parents that the costs of Kareilys’s consultation, exams, brain surgery, post-op, and rehabilitative therapy will be varied and costly.I, Dania Blanco, am launching this campaign, on behalf of Kareilys and her parents, in hopes that together we can lighten their burden during this very difficult time. The funds raised will go towards covering the expenses of Kareilys’s brain surgery, post-operative care, and rehabilitative therapy, as well as travel expenses. I will be in charge of making the payments directly to the hospitals, doctors, and therapist that are involved in her brain surgery and recovery. Any monies left over will be donated to the UHealth International Program and the Department of Neurosurgery of the University of Miami so that they may continue to help other brave warriors like ours.Please donate whatever you can to help Kairelys get through this and have a chance at a normal life. Share her story with as many people as you can and say a little prayer for our brave warrior. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Kareilys es una hermosa niña de 14 años que se prepara para celebrar sus Quinces. Ella es una adolescente enérgica y amante de la diversión que a ha pasado por tanto y aún mantiene una sonrisa en su rostro.Kareilys fue diagnosticada con un raro trastorno cerebral llamado Malformación de Arnold Chiari. La malformación de Chiari es un trastorno neurológico grave en el que la parte inferior del cerebro se hernia hacia abajo fuera de la base del cráneo, lo que hace que la médula espinal se apiñe, lo que ejerce presión sobre el cerebro y la columna vertebral y causa muchos síntomas incapacitantes. Específicamente, Kareilys está empezando a perder la vista, el equilibrio y la fuerza muscular. También está experimentando pérdida de conciencia y sufre dolores de cabeza extremos.La cirugía cerebral de Kareilys por su malformación de Chiari es muy compleja y actualmente no puede ser realizada por los médicos en su país de origen, Cuba. Afortunadamente, a Kareilys se le otorgó una Visa Humanitaria, que le permite a ella y a su madre volar a Miami, FL para reunirse con los médicos de la División de Neurocirugía en el Hospital de la Universidad de Miami a través de UHealth International para evaluación y plan quirúrgico. Los coordinadores y los médicos han informado a sus padres de que los costos de la consulta, los exámenes, la cirugía cerebral, el postoperatorio y la terapia de rehabilitación de Kareilys serán variados y costosos.Yo, Dania Blanco, estoy lanzando esta campaña, en nombre de Kareilys y sus padres, con la esperanza de que juntos podamos aligerar su carga durante este momento tan difícil. Los fondos recaudados se destinarán a cubrir los gastos de la cirugía cerebral, la atención postoperatoria y la terapia de rehabilitación de Kareilys, así como los gastos de viaje. Estaré a cargo de hacer los pagos directamente a los hospitales, médicos y terapeutas que participan en la cirugía y recuperación de su cerebro. Cualquier dinero sobrante será donado al Programa Internacional UHealth y al Departamento de Neurocirugía de la Universidad de Miami para que puedan continuar ayudando a otros valientes ninos como la nuestra.Dona lo que puedas para ayudar a Kairelys a superar esto y tener la oportunidad de tener una vida normal.

On that day, what was meant to be a joyful event took an unexpected turn. We had admitted ourselves to the hospital, looking forward to Carrie delivering our second child -- our little princess, Tessa -- to join our growing family. While Carrie was in labor, Tessa’s heart rate dropped unexpectedly, and subsequently Carrie went into cardiac arrest. The ER doctors immediately performed a C-section while simultaneously performing CPR on Carrie to keep her alive. Carrie's condition became extremely critical. Carrie suffered a very rare childbirth emergency (1/40,000 births) known as Amniotic Fluid Embolism (AFE), in which the amniotic fluid enters the mother's blood stream and triggers an allergy-like reaction, which resulted in cardio-respiratory collapse. Immediately after the AFE, Carrie suffered the second phase of this condition known as Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) which caused abnormal blood clots to occur throughout her body while leading to massive blood loss elsewhere. During this process, Carrie went through a blood transfusion that resulted in 73 bags (300cc per bag) of blood to keep her alive.After spending 25 days in critical condition in the ICU, Carrie’s condition has finally stabilized over this past week. While we feel extremely blessed that both Carrie and Tessa survived and are both still here with us today, we are still waiting further diagnosis on Carrie’s condition. What we currently know is that Carrie will remain hospitalized for the immediate future as doctors still need to monitor her closely. We also know that she suffered a series of strokes that will affect her speech, vision, and hand-eye coordination which the doctors believe can be re-learned over long-term physical therapy and intensive treatment.Carrie is a gifted pianist and a full-time piano instructor who is truly passionate about her work with kids. While we are optimistic that she will eventually make a recovery, we are expecting a long road to rehabilitation which will prevent her from getting back to her normal life and providing for her family in the coming years.Carrie is one of those individuals that you would describe to be the kindest and sweetest person that you’ve ever met, and I’m fortunate to call her my wife. She’s a dedicated mother, daughter, sister, teacher and friend. She loves more than anything to spend time with our two-and-a-half year son, Tristan, and I know she can’t wait to hold him again and also to finally meet our new baby girl, Tessa.We are creating this fundraiser to help pay for the hospitals bills, physical rehabilitation, speech therapy, and help to take care of baby Tessa and Tristan. Carrie will also require additional care such as neurologic rehabilitation to help with her long-term recovery after the stroke she suffered.

Kevin has worked at the Market Basket for the last nine years, including throughout his college career at UNH. He has always considered himself part of the Market Basket family. When Kevin collapsed at work, he had the great fortune of having a co-worker who likely saved his life. His swift actions to seek medical attention aided in Kevin being rushed to the hospital. Kevin was then med-flighted to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston where he underwent emergency brain surgery that evening.On Monday November 23rd, Kevin had his second brain surgery in 18 days. We are thankful that the surgery went as the doctors had hoped, but he has a long road ahead. Although there are small signs of improvement occurring daily, Kevin is unable to walk and has trouble speaking. In the coming days, he hopes to be released to inpatient rehabilitation where he will still need our continued thoughts and prayers for his recovery. As his medical bills are already starting to mount, and his monthly college loan payments are still due, I am asking for your help. Would you please consider making a donation in Kevin’s name?

COVID-19 was sequestering all of his catering business as the restrictions on social gatherings were getting tighter and tighter. Then it happened.He made an awkward noise and started to grab the center of his chest. As a physician, I naturally went into 'first-responder mode' and asked all the pertinent questions as I settled him on the floor and gave him four baby aspirin. I thought it was a heart attack but his answers to my questions did not match. After seconds of watching him, I knew... and I prayed as I frantically dialed 911.He was rushed to the hospital and then to another specialty hospital for emergency vascular surgery on his aorta. What I feared was confirmed and it took prayer and the skill of a highly trained vascular team to correct his issue in over 14 hours of surgery. A second surgery was done days later to washout and close his chest. After almost a week, he was able to come off the ventilator briefly, only to have to be reintubated and eventually trached to relieve the pressure on his vocal cords and assist with oxygenation.I struggled to cope with what was happening, but the GRACE and PEACE of God was with me. To make matters worse, COVID-19 shut all hospitals down to visitors. I was not allowed to see him but I called for updates round the clock and made frequent visits to drop off pictures, notes and trinkets to let him know that he is not alone as soon as he had an awareness of his surroundings. By the GRACE of God, he will make a full recovery!We just moved to Dallas in the new year and, in the transition, our health insurance associated with my last practice terminated. I have not established with a new medical practice or taken any contract jobs since the move. Fitzgerald is still in the ICU and will likely discharge home directly from there. His rehabilitation is expected to take a few months with need for follow up with doctors from cardiology (heart), nephrology ( kidneys), pulmonology (lungs) and with the E.N.T. (ear, nose and throat) specialist to have his tracheostomy removed. We planned to do his physical therapy mostly at home to save costs but I am certain they will also have some visits to follow his progress to full function.This Go Fund Me is to help cover the medical expenses and sustain us as we continue on the journey to restoration. It is hard to ask for what seems like an excessive amount but medical care can absorb funds very quickly. Every gift, no matter how small, is precious to us. We are saying thank you in advance and will keep our supportive family updated. Please do not think that you have nothing to offer. We are just as grateful for prayers!I can not help but see the amazing testimony for salvation in Jesus as God writes our story. When we get to full recovery and press forward to opening day for our restaurant, it will be a tangible story of the the Lord's provision and healing hands.

As you know, Tharon is on the list for a heart transplant in Boston. Unfortunately, his health has taken a turn for the worst and he will be undergoing open heart surgery to have an LVAD installed next week. Tharon passed out twice yesterday and was later admitted to the hospital.The left ventricular assist device, or LVAD, is a mechanical pump that will be implanted inside Tharon’s chest to help his weakened heart pump blood. Unlike a total artificial heart, the LVAD doesn't replace the heart. It just helps it do its job. The LVAD will act as a bridge until Tharon’s new heart is available.Amongst the normal challenges associated with any open-heart surgery, there are also psychological and emotional obstacles that Tharon may face. Though the LVAD will allow Tharon to continue to live a productive life, there are limitations and lifestyle changes that he will endure. For example, the device contains internal and external components. The pump will sit inside of his body, while the power supply will be outside of his body. He will need to register with the local fire department to ensure he is covered in the case of a power outage; the device will need to be plugged in each night when he goes to bed; etc.As you can imagine, the medical and general living costs associated with weekly doctor’s appointments, the surgery and post-surgery rehabilitation are going to be astronomical. To make matters worse, as Tharon was preparing for the upcoming surgery, he recently learned that his insurance does not offer a short term or long- term disability benefit. This was a devastating blow to the plan. This go-fund-me account has been set up to off-set Tharon’s medical and rehabilitation costs. Any help you can provide is much appreciated. I will continue to provide updates as this journey continues. It is important that we also provide the utmost support to our friend and brother.  Over this past year as this journey really kicked off, I have had the pleasure of sharing a house with Tharon. Though we all face obstacles in our day to day lives, Tharon has not had the easiest road, but he would never let that show. Every morning, the coffee waspoured and there were lots oflaughs before heading into work. People would often see him and say that it looks like nothing is wrong with him. However, they didn't see him on a daily basis or the struggles that he encountered. There have been multiple hospital stays (7-12 days at a clip) to take in excess of 15-20lbs of fluid off of his heart; he has had seizures, passed out, and general fatigue. But when he knew he was going somewhere, that big smile was out for the world to see. He never wanted anyone to worry for or about him – that is his nature. It’s time for Tharon to take a break, focus and prepare for this next chapter of his life. He has touched all of our lives in so many ways. Now it’s time for him to accept help from friends and family.If anyone would like to send a picture to be posted on this page, please do so. The goal for this account has been set to $50k to offset initial expenses - however as we learn more, we will update you.  Please pass this link onto your friends and family who may also know Tharon and want to help.Read more"

Their combined medical bills exceed $8,000 per month. Kristin'a family, as her sole providers- are expanding their home in order to better care for Kristina and Lucas. Your contribution helps this Sarasota, FL family who is facing a lifetime of medicalFULL STORY: Just days after giving birth, 25-year-old new mom Kristina Brightbill and her husband Jedidiah knew that something was wrong with their newborn, Lucas. Lucas was inconsolable, colicky, had blood tinged stool, was covered in sores, and became chronically ill. Although multiple doctors reassured Kristina and her husband that everything was fine, the new mom knew in her heart that something was very wrong. She persevered and fought for her son, seeking expert opinions from all over the country until Lucas was finally diagnosed with Mast Cell Activation Disorder, a disease that renders him allergic to practically everything- including water. Determined to provide a quality life for Lucas in spite of his diagnosis, Kristina, Jedidiah & Lucas flew to California to pursue the top Mast Cell specialist in the US.By this point, Lucas was being sustained by his mother's breast milk- where Kristina was on an 8 month diet of solely quinoa, the ONLY food that Lucas could tolerate. As a determined mom, Kristina lived on quinoa and nothing else. She was exhausted, malnourished, and battling her own newly-activated Mast Cell Activation Disorder coupled with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a connective tissue disease. Kristina and her mom, Linda, were packing up to come home after a threemonth long trip to California when the unimaginable happened. Kristina's body succumbed to the pressure and exhaustion, and she suffered a massive brain stem stroke in October of 2015. The brainstem is responsible for all communication in the body. The brain stem tells the lungs to breath, the heart to beat, the arm to raise and the foot to move. Due to poor medical intervention, Kristina's stroke was not diagnosed properly for 3 days and by the time it was diagnosed, the long term damage had already been done. Kristina was then diagnosed with Locked-In- Syndrome, an extremely rare secondary disorder to the stroke that renders the patient aware and alert but unable to move, talk or eat. To date, only two people in the world have been known to come out of ""locked in"". Kristina is unable to speak, swallow, move, hold or play with her son. It has been an emotionally debilitating journey, but through it all- she has not given up. That was 16 months ago. Today, Kristina, a physical therapist herself, has been able to prove many doctors wrong. In spite of their grim prognosis, she breathes on her own and is making slow progress in her physical therapy every single day. Communication is attained by spelling the alphabet with eye blinks, where she is able to turn letters into words and sentences. It is a tedious process, but allows Kristina to have a voice. Kristina's medical care is extensive as our primary goal is to prevent life threatening infections that plague her already compromised body.While Kristina's health demands 24/7 care, we are so thankful that Lucas' diagnosis has stabilized due to aggressive medical intervention. Lucas is a spunky 2 1/2 year old whose life is sustained by a strict diet of lamb, red potatoes, 'sacha inchi' oil and small amounts of broccoli and banana. Those are the only foods he can tolerate at this time without going into a full allergic reaction and possibly anaphylaxis. Lucas will likely never be able to attend a public school due to his diagnosis and even the time he spends outside is limited due to environmental factors. Kristina and Lucas are blessed to have family who helps provide care and support them. Kristina's mom Linda Daly, immediately quit her job and she takes care of both Kristina and Lucas's needs full time and is with them both every single day, 24/7 along with her husband and Kristina's father, Jimmy.A single day in Kristina’s life includes medications, tracheotomy care, PICC line dressing changes, IV injections, feeding tubes, skin breakdowns and infection control. The real challenge is advocating for Kristina's needs with insurance companies, social security offices, doctor's offices, medical companies, referrals and prescription refills. Something as simple as getting a medical mattress to prevent bed sores can takes months of emails and phone calls to accomplish. The family has learned the art of appealing decisions and spend countless hours walking the line between providing physical care for Kristina and advocating for her needs.The family is simply exhausted and have come to the mutual agreement that they need to work smarter rather than harder. After many months of debate, Kristina's parents have made the decision to expand their home for the sake of Kristina and Lucas' physical, emotional, and financial care. The Daly's have plans in the works to build an addition onto their home so that Kristina's care can be better managed and so Lucas can spend more quality time with his mom. Having everyone under the same roof will cut down on travel time and make their lives more efficient and manageable. Building that addition is an extremely costly endeavor, and all past fundraising has been allocated towards Kristina and Lucas’ needs. Today the family is seeking your support. Our fundraising goal is $200,000. This will cover the home rennovations, caregiving costs, better rehabilitation equipment, and other various medical costs. We understand that times are hard for everyone, so if you cannot help financially, please consider what you might possess that could help this family. Perhaps you are a plumber or own a cabinet company? Maybe you're an electrician, or your brother is a surveyor? Is your neighbor a roofer, or your husband a contractor? Would you like to donate the materials we need? Maybe you have access to purchasing items wholesale? Help spread the word. Share Kristina's story. If we shout from the mountaintops, the valley will hear of Kristina's journey. After all, nobody can do everything, but everybody can do something. Please don't close this page until you have considered any resource that you may be able to contribute to our journey. Any money that we raise above our goal will go directly to Kristina and Lucas’ ongoing medical care and for therapeutic resources to aid in Kristina's recovery. In spite of all the challenges this family has faced over the past 2.5 years, the Brightbill & Daly families are humbled by the outpouring of love and support. Kristina would like to personally thank you all for your prayers, cards, emails, posts, phone calls and visits. Your support is the fuel that keeps the fire burning for Kristina's fight and seeing her son Lucas grow up is what fans those flames. Words simply fall short to express her gratitude. Thank you all and God Bless.Read more"

Who am I: Jasmine Cooper2. Where I'm from: I have been living in Colorado Springs since 2008.3. Relationship to Jeff: Girlfriend since 20124. How the funds will be used: Various medical expenses not covered by insurance: therapies, rehab equipment, medications, etc.; home modificationsJeff is an expert snowboarder and has been riding for over 15 years. On January 26, the day after his 29th birthday, he was in a catastrophic snowboarding accident that has changed the course of our lives. He was riding along a tree line in Breckenridge, CO when he caught an edge that sent him flying dangerously fast and straight into a tree, knocking him unconscious for several minutes. Although he was dazed after regaining consciousness, he knew immediately that something was wrong and realized he couldn't feel his legs. He was rushed in a Flight for Life helicopter to St. Anthony’s Hospital where imaging showed multiple fractures to his thoracic spine on the T4 and T5 vertebrae. He was prepped for an immediate spinal fusion surgery to realign the spine, remove bone fragments and fluid to alleviate pressure on the spinal cord. Jeff sustained nerve damage to his spinal cord that can take 6 to 24 months to heal, rendering him paraplegic with a 10% chance of walking again. After his spinal fusion, doctors later found he had fractured his scapula, clavicle, humoroushead, 3 ribs, his left tibia and small fractures in his cervical and lumbar spinal regions. He underwent two more surgeries to address his clavicle and tibia fractures during his first week at the hospital. He spent 7 days in the ICU and another 10 days on a regular floor. After almost 3 weeks at St Anthony’s, Jeff was admitted to his rehabilitation facility, Craig Hospital, to begin inpatient therapy. Despite the circumstances, he has remained strong, positive, and is determined to recover to the best of his ability. Jeff’s doctors and therapists are continually impressed with his progress and have shared their delight in working with him because of his ability to bring fun and infectious laughter into every interaction. If you know Jeff, this will not come as a surprise to you. He refuses to let this life-changing injury define him, or to keep him from living a fulfilling life. Jeff’s discharge date from inpatient care at Craig Hospital is April 30. We know that the pandemic is affecting everyone in a variety of ways. For Jeff, the pandemic has limited the quality of his experience at Craig due to the outing and visitor restrictions. The outings provided by Craig were crucial for Jeff to get real world experience with his injury and the visitor restrictions affected the ability of Jeff’s loved ones to be a part of his inpatient rehabilitation. The first year of exercise and therapy after spinal cord injury is essential for Jeff’s recovery, therefore, we need equipment for him to continue at home. That being said, costs not covered by insurance are quickly adding up, beyond our ability to afford them on our own. We realize the pandemic has caused hardship for so many, and the timing is far from ideal for us to request donations; it is difficult for us to ask this of our friends and family. We thank everyone who has offered their love and support throughout all of this whether you came to visit us, called us, texted us, and/or kept us in your prayers. We are forever grateful and appreciate any help right now in the way of donations or shares if you are unable to donate.With love,Jeff and JasClick for more Photos of Jeffs JourneyI will list below a detailed description of Jeff’s injuries and what the donations will be going to. This doesn’t include all costs but those of highest priority.Injuries sustained:Dislocated right shoulder; fractured right clavicle; fractured right scapula; humeral fracture, fractured left tibia; 3 fractured ribs; and several spinal fractures: C5 - C6 cervical spine fracture, L2 - L3 lumbar spine fracture, and T4 - T5 thoracic spine fracture.What will these funds do for Jeff? Home modifications ($20k+):building a ramp to enter the home, changing the flooring from carpet to hardwood for better wheelchair mobility, switching out sinks to floating sinks to allow room for a wheelchair to fit underneath, gutting the bathroom and installing a roll-in shower.Rehabilitation equipment ($31.5k+):- FES bike ($18k): The FES bike uses electrical current to cause muscle contractions by stimulating peripheral nerves. Research has shown FES is effective in treating both chronic and acute conditions. The FES bike causes muscle contractions that allow patients to pedal even if they have lower extremity weakness or flaccidity.- SmartDrive ($6k): SmartDrive is a lightweight power assist for manual wheelchairs that helps users to go up hills and ramps and cover extended distances without having to push.- Various Medical Equipment ($5k)- Hand controls for motor vehicle ($2.1k)- Medication not covered by insurance ($400+ per month)Read more"

On 7th October 2016, Katherine Boulton suffered a major bleed on the brain and needed resuscitating. This resulted in 11 hours of brain surgery and she remained in an induced coma for three weeks thereafter; Katherine was 20 weeks pregnant at the time. 

Since then, Katherine has regained consciousness, but was unable to breathe independently and so a tracheotomy was fitted to assist her. She was unable to move at all initially but, over the eight weeks that followed, she slowly regained the ability to move her left side and showed other signs of improvement. Katherine was fully aware and able to communicate ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ through blinks and was progressing steadily. 

Sadly, on 8th December, Katherine’s tracheotomy became dislodged resulting in a cardiac arrest,
which took six minutes to revive her from. Since this time, Katherine has been kept sedated in intensive care to help her progress. Unfortunately, Katherine caught the Candida Auris infection, which entered into her blood and affected her blood pressure, heart rate and breathing; hence, the decision was made to deliver her baby on Christmas Day, at 31 weeks pregnant. 

Phoebe was born weighing 4lb 6oz and is currently in the neonatal unit, receiving support with breathing and treatment for the same infection that her Mummy has. Katherine is not yet aware of the birth of her beautiful baby girl and will not be able to hold her and look after her in the way that she had dreamed. Phoebe will remain in the neonatal unit for another six to eight weeks. 

Katherine has had to have numerous surgeries to drain fluid from her brain and will continue to need further surgeries in the future. At the moment, the doctors do not know what additional damage has been caused by the cardiac arrest, but have noted that she will need support for the rest of her life and will remain in hospital for a minimum of six months. 

Katherine’s husband - Jamie - is balancing looking after their five year old son Ollie and visiting Katherine and Phoebe, who are at completely opposite ends of John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford. He visits four times a week, which takes around two hours each way and costs around £500 a month in fuel. When Phoebe is discharged from the hospital, Jamie will be continuing his visits to see Katherine, whilst looking after their little boy and new born baby too. He is also fighting to hold
down his job, in which he has had to reduce his hours, to allow time to visit Oxford during the week. 

Katherine has spent her whole life working to support other people. She trained as a nurse and worked at a therapeutic children’s home for more than ten years, where she looked after young people who really needed her help. After becoming a Mum, she moved on to supporting young people in the community, by setting up and running events and youth clubs. 

Now, after so many years of supporting others, Katherine really needs us to help support her and
her family. 

We want to raise money for the whole family, initially to help towards the cost of diesel for Jamie to continue to visit Katherine and Phoebe at the hospital. We would also like Jamie to not have to worry about a reduction in his salary over this time and the loss of Katherine’s salary, which will impact enormously upon looking after the whole family and paying all the bills involved with
keeping a roof over their heads. We also know that they will need money to go towards Katherine’s rehabilitation needs in the future - whatever these are at the point she can be discharged from hospital. 

Pheobe is a little Christmas miracle, please give anything you can to help support this lovely family. We would be very grateful if you could share Katherine’s story with friends and family to help raise as much as possible. 

Thank you.

Sadly, tragedy has struck the Kislingburys and they need our help to get through what will likely be the hardest year of their lives.On May 10th, three-year-old Jake woke in the morning crying ""Daddy needs to turn on the lights."" He couldn't see. He had been complaining of head pain for a couple of weeks. Trips to the Doctor and antibiotics for a suspected ear infection didn't help. The morning of May 10th, Jake was rushed to the QEH, where the cause of his blindness was discovered: he had a mass in his head that was pressing on his optic nerve. Little Jake was flown to Halifax and underwent a 7-hour surgery to remove the tumor. He was diagnosed with Burkitt's Lymphoma, a type of cancer affecting young children. Several other tumors have been found throughout Jake's body. Doctors have told the Kislingburys there is a 70% to 80% chance of curing the cancer. But, Jake must undergo 8 months of chemotherapy treatments at the IWK Hospital in Halifax.Tragically, Jake is not expected to regain his sight. He will require extensive rehabilitation to help him adapt to his new reality.Dave is employed by Atlantic Controls, a commercial heat/air condition company, and Verity is employed at P.E.I. Newcomers Assn. This family will be under tremendous financial strain over the course of Jake's treatment--loss of pay, accommodation, food, travel costs, and rehab for Jake willweigh heavily on them.Currently, Dave and Verity are at Jake's bedside and are unable to leave his room due to COVID-19 measures. Meanwhile, family and friends in P.E.I. are caring for Jake's 7 year-old brother, William. William hasn't yet grasped the extent of Jake's condition and dearly misses his parents and little brother.This family needs our help so they can focus on staying positive for little Jake. He's got a battle ahead of him.Any donation is greatly appreciated. Thank you kindly,Jeannie and Phil Pitts

Unfortunately, this was the reality for Troy and Katie's parents last week.After years of hard work, long hours and early morning starts, Troy and Katie finally managed to put some pennies away and invest in their dream of owning their own business. Post signing of the contract, the young couple made their way to Thailand in what would be their last holiday to celebrate before embarking on the next chapter of their lives.Unfortunately, all did not go to plan. Tragically, last week they were involved in a scooter accident in Thailand that has left Katie with facial injuries and Troy with severe injuries to his leg.As a result of the accident,Troy has dislocated his knee, torn three ligaments and crushed the main artery in his leg. This is an extremely serious injury that required major surgery, and quickly. Unfortunately, it took 26 hours for Troy to receive proper medical attention, six hospitals, a three hour ferry ride and a four hour drive - all without his leg stabilised. By the time Troy got to hospital, severe blood clots had formed.Troy is currently in a hot, crowded public Thai hospital with no air conditioning and open wounds. Troy is experiencing crippling pain and the fight to save his leg is ongoing.After a number of surgeries, the situation has reached a point where the decision has had to be made to fly Troy back home to receive specialist medical attention in Australia.The complication with trying to get Troy home is that due to the nature of his injuries, he must keep his leg straight at all times and therefore has to travel by stretcher. Should Troy not travel by stretcher, it means that Troy will be forced to stay in a Thai hospital for months until further surgeries can be completed. The hospital is hot and the risk of infection is growing by the day. Currently, Troy has a high temperature and is in a world of pain. Despite this, he is doing his best to stay strong, calm and be his usual funny self. Troy's mum and sister have dropped everything and rushed over to be by his side.Unfortunately, due to a series of loopholes, Troy's medical insurer has refused to pay any money to help with the mounting medical expenses. Airplane travel by stretcher is very expensive and more than what we can all afford.Therefore, from the bottom of our hearts, we ask you to please donate to bring our boy Troy home and get him the medical care that he so desprately needs.And hopefully continue on to fulfill his dream ofowning and operating his own Baker's Delight.We wholeheartedly and genuinely thank you for any help you can provide.UPDATE:Yesterday Troy, myself (his mum) and his sister spent 14 hours in an ambulance from Hat Yai where we were to Bangkok airport. Troy and Katie finally made their way home last night back to Melbourne where Troy will undergo a knee reconstruction and repair to his ACL, LCL and PCL. Our family cannot begin to say thank you to all who has assisted and helped to get him home, the money raised will pay for his scans and X-rays in Surat Thani which amounted to AU$2800, ICU, his four surgeries and the rest of his stay in Songklanagrind Hospital which amounted to AU$12,800. We have also had to pay AU$3200 for the external fixation as he has had to fly home with it. To get him home, the funds raised have covered Troy's and Katie's airfare. We were lucky enough to get the green light from the airline to fly him business class instead of by stretcher which is why we were able to drop the target by such a large amount. The tickets have cost AU$4000. There are additional costs that we need to pay for the 5 hospitals that Troy was transferred between prior to us arriving and Troy making it to the Songklanagarind Hospital, as well as costs incurred for medication and, crutches and other bits that he needed to be able to fly, which we have not yet had time to add up but is looking like it will come in around AU$3000.The 14hr ambulance trip has cost AU$1000 and the patient transport from airport to hospital in Melbourne will be a further $1200.Soon Troy will be paying for rehabilitation and physio that will not be fully covered in Aus, so any remaining funds will be put towards this. We are no longer asking for donations as we are believe most of the costs have been covered by your overwhelming generosity.Read more"

She was able to pull over to the side of the road and dial two numbers 91 before she lost consciousness. Miraculously the police found her, performed CPR anddispatched an ambulance. During that day Sheryl was transported to three different hospitals, each with progressively greater levels of trauma care, to save her life.For over a week Sheryl remained in the Intensive Care Unit, unconscious until late Christmas Eve, when she regained consciousness and was able to respond to Tim. It was a memorable day; she was coherent and responsive, we were elated. Due to COVID restrictions, the hospital did not allow any visitors for Sheryl. Tim and Sheryl’s sister Renee were only able to communicate with her by phone.Unfortunately, on December 26th, Sheryl had another cardiac event and was without oxygen forapproximately 10minutes. This event caused significant damage to several areas of her brain. She was placed on aventilator and was unresponsive for the next 3 weeks. Since that time, she has had several infections and numerous medical setbacks. Sheryl has had countless tests to evaluate the extent of the damage to her brain. On February 5th Sheryl was transferred to a Long-termfacility. Here she will receive physicaltherapy as they work to remove herfrom ventilator support. Unfortunately, she will require a feeding tube for the foreseeable future. The prognosis is unknown, and we will continue to hope and pray for a miracle.Progress has been very slow; the trauma to Sheryl’s body has been significant and there is so much to heal. However, anyone who knows Sheryl, knows that she is a FIGHTER! There are days when her eyes open and she looksaround likeshe is trying to figure out what is going on, but it is difficult to know what she can comprehend. SometimesTim and her sister Renee think sherecognizes them, and other times they think it might just be wishful thinking. The neurologists have said her brain damage is severe and that she may neverrecognize her family nor resume a ""normal"" life. Right now, it appears that Sheryl will likely require 24/7 care. Sadly, Sheryl, Tim, and their three sons have been through so much since Sheryl’s injury. Many family and friends have asked how they can help. As you can imagine, this horrendous ordeal has impacted the family financially as well as emotionally. The family is trying to reduce their expenses and come together to help support the family. Ryan and Nick, the older boys, are paying rent and Ryan has taken overSheryl's car payment. Tanner, the youngest, is attending Bemidji State andthey are doing what they can so he can finish his degree.Immediately, financial help is needed to help them make the adjustment from a two-person to a single-person income. It is likely that Sheryl will not be able to work again. We hope and pray for Sheryl’s health to improve and for her to return home someday.

Like anyone with a beloved pet, you know that our fur babies are like our children. The past week of my life has been filled with stress, anxiety and fear at the thought of losing my best friend Jackson. Thank you in advance for reading my story. If you are unable to donate, please find it in your heart to share. I grew up with dogs my whole life. Being a dog lover, i’ve always dreamt of one day having my own. On May 21st, 2013, a friend and I decided to go to a local shelter “to look around” and play with the dogs. We approached the cage full of puppies all eagerly pawing at the front gate. Jackson, who was sitting timidly in the back, immediately caught my eye. I called for him to come front with the rest of the dogs, and he came straight into my arms. From there it was game over. Tears rolled down my cheeks and I knew Jackson had picked me to be his mama. There was no question in my mind that he was the dog I was meant to find and I took him home with me that very day. Since rescuing Jackson, he has filled my life with so much joy. He loves to play outside, snack on treats and sleep away the day with me snuggled up in my bed. Jackson has been by my side through all of the ups and downs of my twenties as my most unconditionally loyal and loving friend, and I could never imagine my life without him. Until last week, Jackson has been a happy, healthy normal boy. Tragedy struck on Sunday, February 25th. I woke up in the morning to find my sweet Jackson panting at the end of my bed hardly moving. Immediately I knew something was very wrong. Jackson loves to jump out of bed to go outside to go potty but this particular morning Jackson was unable to move. I picked him up and carried him outside only to find that he had absolutely no feeling in his back legs. Completely paralyzed from the waist down, Jackson laid in the grass panting, in pain and confusion. I scrambled to get Jackson to my local vet in Myrtle Beach, SC. They admitted him immediately and discovered helping him was beyond their medical capabilities. They urged that I rush Jackson to an emergency specialty clinic 2 hours away in Charleston, SC. Without hesitation, I wrapped him up and drove him the 2 hours to Charleston for immediate care. Jackson was admitted to the specialty clinic and underwent an immediate CT scan. It was discovered that he suffered a herniated disc in his spine which left him paralyzed him from the waist down. The veterinarians educated me on the procedures necessary to help him walk again and I was immediately overwhelmed with emotion. The first nights stay in the ER was $723 and the surgery itself plus aftercare totaled almost $6,000. I became panic stricken at the thought of the financial burden preventing me from keeping my sweet Jackson alive. I knew in my heart that I could never give up hope and I would do anything in the world to help keep him with me. I agreed to pay the amounts for ER stay, surgery and post op care and rehab. God's grace shined upon us and granted my wishes for a successful surgery. Jackson is now home, has regained feeling in his back legs and is even been able to use the potty by himself again! But  this is just the beginning. We have a long road to recovery as now Jackson has to learn to walk all over again. He is able to walk with the support of a sling and gets a little stronger each day. I can feel the fight in him to continue to work hard to walk and be his normal self again. This has been such a scary time for us both but I know Jackson will never give up hope just like I never gave up hope on him. In addition to the financial strain of the surgery costs, I have also had to take off a substantial amount of time from work for his at home rehabilitation. This impacts me directly as I only earn money when I am actually working. I have always been financially secure and this is the first time in my life I have feared for what may come. A few weeks ago, I never could have imagined this could happen to us. As difficult as it is to reach out for help, I believe that any act of kindness no matter how small is ever wasted. I also believe that what goes around comes around and that when you are in need the goodness of those around you is enough to move mountains. What is so small to one person can be so huge to someone in need. Please find it in the goodness of your heart to donate to help me get my best friend the care he needs for a successful recovery.Read more"

On August 5th our family received a phone call that will forever change us. Our beautiful Chelsea Taylor suffered a horrific, accidental fall from the third floor of her hotel in Italy and was only given hours to survive. However, in true Chelsea fashion, she held on strong until her parents, Mary and Shane, could fly to be by her side and using those stubborn Irish genes has been fighting strong ever since overcoming incredible odds, undergoing numerous surgeries and tests, and giving us all hope for recovery! Chelsea was so excited to be joining her boyfriend of five years, Luis, and his family on a long awaited vacation to explore Europe for the first time…seeing new sights, making new memories, and living the life any hard working twenty-four year old college graduate should. 

In order to keep Chelsea fighting and get her back to living the life she loves, her family needs to be by her side every moment. They are forced to find long term lodging in a foreign country while continuing to run their home here, pay exorbitant medical bills that continue to mount, provide for intense rehabilitation, and finallyBRING OUR CHELSEA HOME. To know this family is to know they are a family of four and are fighting with every ounce of strength and courage they have to keep their family together. It is our hope through this page to lighten the burden for Chelsea and her family in the only way we can during this incredibly heartbreaking time. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your generosity and ask for your continued prayers and positive thoughts at this unthinkable time, not only for Chelsea but also for Mary, Shane, and Connor who love her beyond measure!

At this time, Shane and Mary are focusing completely on Chelsea, so please direct all questions to Connor and again, THANK YOU!

A labor of love (for which he's never solicited contributions or advertisements), Greg has collected hundreds of then-and-now images of Atlanta, waging a one-man crusade to share with his fellow Atlantans a sense of their history. Over the years his site has been celebrated in multiple news stories and he's garnered thousands of fans as he's helped us appreciate the history of the place we call home.Now, however, it's Greg who is in need of our help.On the evening of June 9, while cycling home from work, Greg was viciously, intentionally run down by a driver and left for dead. Thanks to the help of fast-acting strangers and the amazing work of doctors at Grady Hospital, Greg's life was saved that night.Greg has received outstanding medical care every step of the way. Seven weeks after the attack, however, Greg is facing a long road to recovery. He has suffered multiple injuries, the primary one being a severe brain injury from the impact of the incident. (Importantly, he was wearing a helmet.) There is so much unpredictability about a brain injury, but the consistent word is that Greg will recover on his own timetable. While we have faith that Greg can heal, what many people never realize (unless they have to deal with one of these situations) is that even good health insurance plans won't remotely cover the costs that Greg will incur as he recovers. The brutal truth is that Greg's recovery will have STEEP FINANCIAL COSTS, EVEN WITH HIS HEALTH INSURANCE.While Greg’s insurance has great coverage for hospitalization costs, like many insurance plans, his post-hospitalization benefits are limited. Treatment for a traumatic brain injury goes far beyond hospitalization and inpatient rehabilitation. It will be a lengthy treatment plan requiring outpatient therapy, in-home care, the purchase of rehabilitative equipment, and potential modifications to Greg’s home. With insurance plans that limit the coverage of a patient’s days of outpatient therapy and home nursing care and all the attendant costs of returning home, the odds of recovery favor those with the financial means to pay for treatment. And, obviously, it's essential that Greg gets the best care that's absolutely possible. Thousands of people are familiar with Greg because of Atlanta Time Machine, but to those closest to him, we also know him as a music lover, a promoter of popular country and rockabilly concerts, an avid cyclist, a great co-worker, a dog lover, a wonderful neighbor, and -- most of all -- a funny, thoughtful, and loving boyfriend, brother, and son.So for Greg's sake, for the sake of his many loved ones, and for the sake of Atlantans whose lives have been enriched by his selfless contribution to his community, we are appealing for help.We want that Greg back in our lives as soon as possible, and we're calling on anyone who's been touched by Greg's life and work to ""GIVE FOR GREG."" Greg’s family has established a third party “Special Needs Trust for the Primary Benefit of Gregory Thomas Germani” for this purpose. Any contribution that you are willing to donate to help Greg get the long term care he needs is deeply appreciated. We thank you for sharing Greg's story, and this appeal for help widely. And, most of all, we appreciate your love, support and prayers in Greg's time of need. Contributions made via GoFundMe (or otherwise) will go to this third-party special needs trust, and those funds will only be used to meet Greg’s health care needs not otherwise covered by insurance or other means in accordance with the terms of the trust.

Papua New Guinea's Wildlife and People Need YOUR Help! The future of Port Moresby Nature Park is in peril. It might not sound like a big deal - but it is. The closure of the Park would have a devastating blow on wildlife conservation and the wider PNG community.Without the Nature Park:· 550 unique native animals are at immediate risk with no place to go· There would be no organisation left to rescue, save and rehabilitate wildlife from the horrors of the wildlife trade·  24,000 school children each year would miss out on their only opportunity to attend a school excursion and learn about the importance of PNG's wildlife and the need to protect and conserve the rainforests of PNG· Jobs would be lost. Many Park staff support their entire family and extended families as the sole income earner. Other small businesses, grass-root farmers and artisans would also be impacted through loss of trade· Wildlife conservation and research efforts would stop, with no other facility capable of ex-situ research in PNG· The Port Moresby community would suffer without a safe, open-spaced facility that they can visit and take their families tooWe cannot survive without your support. YOU have the power to help us through COVID-19 and beyond. Please help us make a difference to the lives of people and wildlife in PNG today.How your donation can help:· AU$22 (US$15) will feed and maintain an endangered long-beaked echidna for a week· AU$32 (US$21) will feed and maintain an endangered tree kangaroo for a week· AU$49 (US$32) will cover 1-week of rehabilitation of an injured eagle or owl· AU$56 (US$37) will feed and maintain an endangered cassowary for a week · AU$203 (US$133) will feed and maintain the Park's bird of paradise collection for one week (over 30 individuals)· AU$398 (US$261) will feed and maintain the Park's unique reptile collection· AU$691 (US$453) will save two young orphaned tree kangaroos requiring round the clock careWhy the Nature Park Needs Your HelpThe Nature Park derives almost 70% of its income through visitation and local business support. With visitation drastically reduced and many local businesses unable to support, the Park is reaching out to the global community. It costs Port Moresby Nature Park AUD$48,800 (US$32,000) per month to look after their native wildlife: from the purchasing of food, to paying Wildlife Carer wages, to electricity powering pumps, heating and cooling life-support systems, to water for cleaning, pond maintenance and wildlife drinking, and to security keeping the Park and animals safe. This excludes the costs of other vital services including community and schools education programs and activities.Any donation, big or small can and will make a difference and help Port Moresby Nature Park to continue its important work for wildlife conservation in PNG. About Port Moresby Nature ParkPort Moresby Nature Park is Papua New Guinea’s leading wildlife facility as is the only welfare accredited institute in all the South Pacific Islands (accredited by the Zoo and Aquarium Association of Australasia).

È una persona dall'animo buono, che ama fare dell'ironia e si merita davvero tutto l'affetto che possiamo dargli.È un ragazzo di 27 anni a cui è sempre piaciuto viaggiare, grande tifoso dell'inter, appassionato di sport, videogiochi e lego che da poco stava cercando casa per diventare indipendente. Ad agosto 2020, durante un pomeriggio in piscina, Giovanni ha avuto un incidente che gli ha provocato la rottura scomposta delle vertebre L3,L4 e L5 causandogli una paralisi dal torace in giù. Quella notte ha vinto la sua battaglia per la vita dopo una lunga operazione. Da allora non lo abbiamo più potuto vedere ed è rimasto da solo a superare questo brutto momento a causa della pandemia in corso. Ora finalmente dopo tre mesi ha iniziato il suo percorso riabilitativo presso la struttura di Villa Beretta a Costa Masnaga (LC). Attualmente muove le braccia solo dal gomito al polso ma il suo percorso è appena iniziato , sarà lungo e richiederà tutto l'aiuto economico che possiamo dargli. Questa donazione ha appunto come primo obiettivo farsi carico delle spese della struttura in cui si trova, dal momento in cui non sarà più sovvenzionata dallo stato. Come secondo obiettivo, vorremmo aiutare la sua famiglia a riadattare la loro abitazione, rimuovendo le barriere per rendergli la casa fruibile.Vorremmo far ripartire la vita di Gio come l’aveva lasciata, i viaggi che da solo intraprendeva, il suo lavoro a cui tiene molto e realizzare tutti i progetti lasciati in sospeso per poterne creare di nuovi.

That night he won his battle for life after a long operation. Since that day we've not been able to see him. Because of the pandemic he has to overcome this sad moment by himself. Some weeks ago he has finally started his rehabilitation at Villa Beretta facility in Costa Masnaga (LC). Currently, he’s able to move his arms only from elbow to wrist. His journey to recovery has just begun, it will be long, harsh and will require all the financial help we can give him. The main goal of this donation is to take care of the rehab expenses, since not everything will be subsidized by the state. Secondly, we would like to help his family to readapt their context, removing the barriers to make their home more accessible to him.We would like to restore Gio's life as he left it: with his lonely and adventurous travels, his work that he still loves, making possible all those projects he left behind in order to create new ones.

One of Josh's best friends was with him when his head and right arm went through the springs and smashed into the floor breaking his neck and leaving him paralyzed from the chest down. Josh was airlifted to Sunnybrook hospital from Collingwood that evening and he was rushed into surgery. Josh is the son of our good friend Leslie Pocklington and her partner Chris Dopp. We are looking to his friends and community to support Josh and his family in dealing with untold expenses in the coming years due to the fact that his employer had no insurance. Please give generously.Here is a message from Josh's mom, Leslie, written on August 24, 2017:""Josh is amazing! He can use his right hand now so he communicates with us by writing on a white board. His messages are often heartfelt and leave you in tears. His sense of humour still comes out even in the face of such adversity! Josh was moved into a room with a window yesterday because he was hallucinating. It's common in the ICU because there is no natural light in most of the rooms. The patients have no idea if it's night or day. They literally start going bonkers after a couple of days. The first few days were filled with trauma and shock for all of us. We are resigned to the fact that Joshua will never walk again but continue to believe that he will breathe on his own soon and be able to use his left hand as well at some point. He gets such joy from reading messages from his friends and sisters on his phone.❤️ If we hold his phone for him he can poke out messages back. Yesterday they hoisted him into a chair for an hour or more so he could see out of the window. Such joy!!! The staff and team of neurosurgeons have been incredible. Such a support under one roof. They are remarkable. Truly. We are so blessed to have them. Josh will probably be in the ICU for up to a month and then he will get moved to another ward. After he leaves Sunnybrook he will live at the best rehab centre in the universe, called Lyndhurst, for a minimum of three months. As an aside, his employer did NOT have insurance. This has made us sick we we realize there is nothing coming from insuranceto help Josh for the rest of his life. Keep Josh in your prayers please. Our boy is a survivor but he has many tough times ahead in this new journey.❤️""A message from Chris Dopp, Leslie's Partner:""Josh is 25 years old, athletic and was going to open his own trampoline centre. As a matter of fact, his business plan is sitting on our coffee table because I was reviewing it for him. It's very comprehensive, outlining every dime coming in and out. Josh budgeted $1,000 per month for insurance because that's the number his ""boss"" gave him. Josh broke his neck, is paralyzed and it turns out his ""boss"" has no insurance. This kid had his life planned out. Worked and saved his money and his life went from a missed trampoline landing to a wheelchair in a matter of seconds. I could carry on about what kind of piece of ****would put his employee and his customers at such peril for $560 per month ( that's what he was quoted for insurance), however, I'm going to take the high road. Life is short. Enjoy whatever you can. Seize the moment. Live life till its fullest. But most importantly, never, ever quit. That's what Josh has done and will continue to do.

There, my brother Kevin, at 33, was found deceased in his apartment.We are so absolutely grief-stricken and heartbroken. I cannot put into words the immeasurable loss and grief that we are facing between my brother’s sudden and unexpected passing and my father’s uncertain condition.

We will forever keep Kevin’s loving and funny spirit alive as we continue on with our hurt.On top of our insurmountable loss, we now have the challenge of affording funeral costs along with my father’s ever-growing hospital costs. Kevin, unfortunately, did not have end of life policies arranged. And my father recently started a new job and his insurance benefits have not begun yet. So, we will be responsible for all costs at hand.During this difficult and unprecedented time for everyone, it seems foolish to be making one of these. However, if you are in any way able to donate to my family, your help would be appreciated beyond words. This would help ease the burden of such sudden and tragic loss and medical emergency.

When we met her, my husband and I were struggling to take care of Casey and his sister Elle by ourselves while working full time. Because Nena loves to spend time with Casey, she has helped out on days when we are running late getting home from work. She takes him swimming in the summer and for walks in the park. She makes his favorite pasta and helps him make pizza out of Play-doh. Casey saves the biggest hugs and best kisses for Nena, and they are well-deserved. Please join us as we give back to Nena, who has given so much to us. ""- Terre and Jenny""The first time I visited Ana at home, I had oatmeal for breakfast one morning and drank a Diet Coke with dinner. The next time I visited, Ms. Nena greeted me with a hug, a wash cloth with my name embroidered on it, a pack of oatmeal, and enough Diet Coke to last me for a month."" -ZoëRead more"

Glen was rushed to Geisinger Wyoming Valley where it was determined he suffered a complete spinal cord injury. His neck was broken at the C6 vertebrae requiring emergency surgery to stabilize his neck. This type of fracture causes paralysis to the hands, trunk, and legs. In order to give Glen the best chance at recovering some use of his affected areas we fought to get him accepted out of network at one of the best rehabilitation hospitals. Now he is giving all his drive and determination to his rehabilitation journey, working to move his hands and legs again. In order to regain any mobility, Glen will need to rehabilitate at Magee Rehabilitation Hospital, one of the nation's leading hospitals for spinal cord injuries. While Glen gives all his focus on rehab it is our time to step up and help out with any financial burden he will endure. Your donation will allow him to continue with his recovery while helping with the daunting medical related expenses, now and in the future.Those who know Glen would easily describe him as one of the strongest people they know. If anyone can overcome this enormous hurdle it will be him. Those closest to him also know that he is one of the kindest people you will ever meet. Glen has gone above and beyond to help others throughout his entire life. My hope is that we can all repay Glen for this kindness by helping out in any way you can.

He is originally from the rural village of Kothapalli, India (near Peddapalli, Karimnagar, Telangana). He grew up poor and struggled a lot to earn his college degree. The youngest of five children, Sammaiah also helps his parents financially. Four months ago, he came to the Atlanta, Georgia areaand was planning to bring his wife, Soujanya, and their 1year old daughterover inearly 2018. He is the sole breadwinner of his family and wanted to make sure he was comfortably settled before bringing them.Sammaiah & Soujanya's wedding, 2013November 7: Tragedy StruckSammaiah was walking home from work on the evening of November 7, 2017 when tragedy struck: He was nearly killed by a car as he was walking across the street; the driver had no license. Nearly a dozen police officers arrived on the scene, and Sammaiah was rushed to Grady Memorial Hospital where he received immediate emergency brain surgery that lasted several hours and that saved his life. He came into the hospital with intra-cranial hemorrhaging.As of this writing, Sammaiah is still comatoseand in the ICU at Grady as doctors figure out what the next steps will be.In Soujanya's own words (translated from Telugu):""A day before the accident, I talked to my husband (Sammaiah) as we do daily; he was in the USA and I was in India with our daughter. We discussed our plans about moving our family to the USA perhaps as soon as February. Sammaiah wanted to come back to India to see his parents and then to bring us from India to our new home in the USA. I could not talk to my husband in the evening as we regularly do on November 7. I called my mother-in-law that day to see if she heard from him as he regularly calls both of us. Later that night, we got the dreadful call from colleagues. I had to fly from Indiaimmediately, leaving our toddler with my parents, to find out what happened to Sammaiah. Our dreams of setting up a new home and new life were shattered. I have to stay away from my toddler to take care of my husband as his recovery will take several months. I am new to the USAand don't know how things work. With the assistanceof his friends, I am making this humble pleafor help.""Hehas no medical insurance & needs your helpWe are trying to spread the word about what happened to our dear friend because we know that his medical costs will be extreme, and that this will be an immense hardship on his family. Sammaiah does not have any medical insurance. We do not know when, or even if, he will ever be able to return to work and support his family.Soujanya herself is also from a small village in rural India and speaks very limited English. This tragedy has been very difficult on heras she finds herself now in the United States, trying to cope with this crazy situation.Immediate help is needed to pay for continued post traumamedical care, nursing, and rehabilitation.Sharing is caringEven if you are not able to donate, please share this link to Sammaiah's story so we are able to get him the help he so desperately needs.If you are able to make a donation to help with Sammaiah’s continually growing medical expenses, please donate now.

Each of us istaking on responsibilities to help, according to our individual strengths. I’ve always been a strong writer, so I’ve taken responsibility for setting up and maintaining this GoFundMe account. I’m also being helped greatly by a lot of friends who are providing me with background information, translations where needed, and photographs. I run a small business. I’m a wife and mother as well.When something tragic happens to a friend, you feel that there’s never enough you can do to help. Other friends are connectingwith professionals to help Sammaiah'swife navigate through options and ideas, yet others are translating for her between Telugu and English, etc. We’re doing whatever we can to work as a team. I’m only a small part of the effort, both in the USA and in Sammaiah's home country of India.Where is Marisa from?I live in Milton, Georgia. It’s about a 45 minute drive from downtown Atlanta (assuming good traffic conditions).My relationship to Sammaiah:My husband has worked with Sammaiah for the past 10 years on various office projects. Once in a while, Sammaiah has come to the USA to work on some projects. I’ve known him for a similarly long amount of time. He’s one of the genuinely nicest people I’ve ever met.How will the funds collected be used?I opened a separate bank account specifically to collect all funds and donations for Sammaiah so that it does not get commingled with any personal funds. I promise to withdraw money on behalf of his family and give it directly to his family, or send it directly to pay for medial needs, rehab, and/or the family's financial support- whatever the family prefers.Read more"

The pandemic hit in March and the world changed as we know it. COVID really negatively impacted the lives of so many. For many months, our family had to visit our mother 'through a window' at her long-term care home. Our mum was diagnosed with vascular dementia at a very early age of 69 and was placed in a LTC home in September of 2019, approx. 6 months before the pandemic started. Our father, our brother Steven, and Lorraine & I all took turns visiting her throughout the spring, summer and eventually fall. Fall 2020. This is when Steve's journey began. We had all started to notice some minor changes in Steve’s appearance. He was losing weight. Steve also complained of mild cramping in his right hand and calves. By mid-October, Steve knew that something wasn't right when he began to have difficulty climbing stairs and ladders. He continued to lose weight, muscle mass and overall strength. Steve went to the doctors for a complete work-up and when the results came back showing no obvious abnormalities, it was at that point he realized something else was wrong. His GP informed him that it appeared that his symptoms were neurological, and a referral was given to see a specialist. In late October, Steve worked his last day on the job. His medical condition prevented him from working as a heating and cooling specialist and he started receiving unemployment insurance which later turned into a long-term disability claim. Some money was coming in but not enough to help pay off debt, as well as keep up with current monthly bills. On January 7, 2021 our brother Steven, age 54, was officially diagnosed with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. ALS is a degenerative neuromuscular disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, causing loss of muscle control. Currently, there is no cure for ALS.This news came as a complete shock to Steven, to us all. As you can imagine, our entire family was just devastated. We still are. Steve is staying positive and is committed to doing whatever he can to slow this disease down.Over the next few weeks, more tests were given...MRI's, CT scans and more bloodwork. Steve was placed on medication to try to slow the progression of the disease and an appointment was scheduled to meet his ALS team.Late January, our mother had a bad fall and required surgery for a fractured hip. She is now back in long-tern care recovering, however; the trauma set her dementia back a few more steps and she is also now confined to a tilted wheelchair.On February 1, our family was delivered yet another blow. Our father suffered a massive heart attack and is still under the care of the Acquired Brain Injury program at the same Rehabilitation Centre that Steven visits for this ALS clinic every 3 months. Since Steven's diagnosis, his walking ability has declined. He went from walking with the assistance of a cane in December, to using a walker in January, and most recently, has resorted to look at wheelchairs. It's not that Steve cannot walk, its the fact that he needs to conserve his energy. Simply using his walker to get to the bathroom is exhausting.Steven is now under the care of a great team at the ALS clinic in Ottawa. We have also received so much support from the ALS Society who have a great support network and equipment program, however; there are a lot of costs that are not covered.Living in a wheelchair will bring Steven many challenges. A complete renovation of his apartment is well underway. Costs are being incurred to allow for wheelchair access and future healthcare needs.Steven also requires massage and physio on a weekly basis to slow muscle atrophy and maintain his mobility, not to mention it keeps him motivated. He has medical insurance through his employer, but the annual allowance has lapsed, and it is only March!As you can imagine, our family is under a tremendous amount of stress and anxiety. Steve is struggling to come to terms with his diagnosis and its aggressiveness. Adding to this, is the waiting for his home renovations to be complete and the immense concern for both of his parent’s health and well being. Our family cannot believe the rallying of friends, neighbors, and the entire village of Richmond. This community has come together to support Steve in so many ways. Many people have reached out to our family asking how they can help. This is how you can help. This GoFundMe page is set up to provide the much-needed love, support and funds that Steve needs right now. These funds will allow Steve to continue receiving his weekly physio, acquire a quality motorized wheelchair and other needed equipment, and help us with the home renovation costs. The funds will also help Steve and our family reduce or eliminate the burden of any debt which will provide Steven piece-of-mind while he battles this terrible disease. There are no words that can express how much our family appreciates your support. The many kind words and displays of compassion, love and support is so very beautiful. Our family is just so overwhelmed and so very grateful to all. This outpour of support demonstrates just how much Steve is loved ❤️ Again, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Sending love and light to everyone. Please stay safe during this pandemic and remember to be kind to strangers. You never know what someone else is going through and kind words and a smile can really make a difference ❤️Much love, Steve’s sisters,Samantha & Lorraine#HastieStrongRead more"

His two back legs were completely stiff, as well as one of his front paws which was tucked under. I was rushed with different emotions and immediately knew Max needed care. I took him straight to the vet, where they did x-rays, gave him some pain pills and concluded that he may have had swelling in his spine and said it would all be fine in a few days. Instead of waiting it out, we took Max to another vet. They ran the same tests on him and had suspected a stroke or some kind of spine cancer. Not all vets have MRI machines so we ended up taking Max straight to a specialist for an MRI, ultrasound, and spinal tap hoping we'll have a clearer answer to Max’s condition. My family and I did so much research trying to figure out what happened to Max and many other dogs with Max’s condition was diagnosed with IVDD (Intervertebral disk disease), which is when a disk shatters on the spine making one completely unable to walk. When the results came back from the MRI, surgery was not an option at all(no slipped disks found) and instead a lot of home care and physical therapy was needed to make Max strong enough to walk on his own. The specialists stated it was a rare unusual neurological dysfunction case known as FCE (Fibrocartilaginous Embolism) which is considered a spinal stroke. The stroke unfortunately occurred in his lower neck which has affected his ability to use his back legs and one of his front paws. The recovery time period is months and only reliable with physical therapy. The vet bills have been astronomical and sadly we don’t have any medical insurance and there is a lot yet to come with his daily rehabilitation needs. In addition to Max not being able to walk, he isn't able to release his bladder on his own. Me and my sister release Max at least 3-5 times a day.Almost 3 months later, Max has been going through tons of physical therapy sessions which are not cheap at all. An average therapy session for Max’s condition can cost up to $300 per session. Max has done hydrotherapy, laser therapy for his spine and acupuncture sessions. I see little improvements each and every day. This need will go on for months. The awesome news is that with this care he can be back to his old tricks some day but it's an uphill climb and he has a long road ahead of him. The vets say he is not in pain, just a little uncomfortable sometimes which is understandable. The thought of putting him down never crossed my mind, Max is fully aware of his surroundings and eats and drinks weII. Max is a strong boy that can overcome this with time. He deserves the opportunity to thrive again and recover from this condition. I would really appreciate it if you could kindly donate anything you can to get the help Max needs to walk on all of his four paws again. Max is not only a dog, but my best friend.With all the craziness going on, it's been tough to handle Max's situation. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.

She will be walking within days.  
My family and I wanted to start a new GoFundMe for Anna’s future.

(10% will go to charity to help others during this crisis we share as a country)


Hello to everyone who has been following my sisters story. Anna Norquist. Thank you to everyone who has continued to pray and support Anna and my family. Twenty months ago, my sister contracted Streptococcus A which caused toxic shock syndrome. The illness nearly killed her. We were actually told at one point to be prepared for her death. But a miracle happened...she lived. Unfortunately, the illness resulted in the loss of all of her limbs. My family and I lived in a hospital for three months and another in a rehabilitation center (RHI) in Indianapolis. And a huge shout out to the staff and facilities that took such great care of my sister. She would not be here without you. 


My mother and I are running this GoFundMe campaign for Anna’s future. The first bill that came to the house was $1.2 million. Her dream of being independent needs to stay alive. And we are limited when it comes to the layout of my parents house. We did reconstruct where we could but because she has been flat on her back and in a wheel chair for 20 months, we kind of just had to wait to see how the healing of her body played out. 


WILL SHE BE ABLE TO WORK?! I dont ever want to see her in an assisted living facility. And she will never be able to live on her own economically on the tiny bit of disability she gets with no hands and no feet. She wants a family, and wants to be able to care for a child. That will never happen if she doesn’t have the right environment. 


The next step she wants to take is for her, jimmy, and I to move in together. To help phase into independence. And that takes away from my brother and I to generate an income as well. So, if you know a house for sale in the area that is one floor with a basement, preferably with some land (Anna wants to raise llamas) that needs to be gutted, please let us know. It all has to be custom done. 


Adoption of technology takes significant effort and time in planning, evaluation, implementation. Various techniques and equipment to facilitate greater independence and personal accomplishment, is something insurance won’t cover. 


When comparing to other quad amputees who phased into being independent, I realized how much this will cost our family.  And my parent will contribute as much as they possibly can, just as they always have. Her car has to be customized. She has to have a custom shower with custom shower prosthetics. She needs an electric bed to help her in and out of her chair. A custom area where she can practice putting on her own prosthetics which will be a mountain in itself. Everything has to be voice activated. She has to have a custom kitchen. And she’s had the same wheelchair that the hospital gave us. A service dog that can get things for her and PROTECT her when I’m not there. 


If I have to stay in my parent house for the rest of my life to take care of my sister, I will. And I know the rest of my family is right there with me. But I want my sister to be happy. I want her to have independence, find love, and be able to hold her own child and raise a family. I want her to put the last two years behind her and find a path to success and a strict routine ultimately leading to happiness. Anything helps. But prayers help the most. Because God has a plan. And I have to continue to believe that there is something greater that will come out of this. Thank you to everyone that has helped Anna thus far. There are not enough lifetimes for me to show my gratitude.  Read more"

Sam was involved in a motorcycle accident on the 5th of October 2020. Sam was rushed to hospital in a critical condition In a induced coma. He has sustained multiple injuries including small brain bleed, brain swelling, broken neck, multiple fractured vertebrae, broken shoulder, plastic surgery to one hand, two broken fingers, collapsed lung, heart aorta tear, 1 snapped femur, both broken knees, shins ankles and all toes broken- he has also now got pneumonia. 12 blood transfusions.He is yet to sit through multiple surgeries to piece back together his ankle and plastic surgery to his hand. He is currently in a coma still and is proving difficult to bring out of it. No doubt Sam will need extensive rehabilitation to make a full recovery and there will be endless expenses along the way that the public health system won’t cover, to prepare for this and take the strain and stress away from him and his family during those times, having funds for that will mean a great deal to Sam and his family.

In a moment of anguish that we can only try to understand, Daniel jumped off of a 100 foot bridge. In a matter of seconds, Daniel sustained injuries that should have easily killed him, however, by God's grace, MIRACULOUSLY, he is still alive. Currently, Daniel has been through 6 surgeries. Two on his abdomen, where his spleen was removed and internal bleeding was stopped. His kidney was bleeding, but the doctors are confident that the kidney will heal. He has had two surgeries on his neck where they repaired a fractured vertebrae that was pushing on his spinal cord. In a second surgery, the doctors placed screws in every vertebrae down his neck to his T1 vertebrae. This is meant to stabilize his entire neck and spine. He has had two surgeries on his hip and pelvis. One surgery was to screw his sacrum back together and the other to repair his shattered hip allowing his leg to stay in the hip socket and prevent dislocation. Our brother able to move his head and arms, and has some movement in his hands and fingers. At this point, he is not able to move his legs. He is able to open his eyes and interact with us. He tries desperately to talk to us. He really wants to know what happened and why his is in the hospital because he can't remember.  By the grace of God, he did not sustain any injury to his brain. At this point, the doctors have done everything they can possibly do to put his body in a position to heal. Now we wait to see what he will be able to do. What mobility and functioning will he have? Will he walk again? These are unanswered questions. The road to recovery will be long. Depending on how well things go, doctors are projecting that he will be in the ICU for at least a couple more weeks (until he can breathe on this own) and then be faced with months of rehab. Our family is devastated and already beginning to think about the journey that lies ahead, but we know we serve a GREAT GOD who is capable of performing miracles. And He already has done great miracles. Daniel is alive, and we pray that God continues to “show off” in this situation. We have been overwhelmed with emotion by the love, prayers, support and concern that we have received from so many friends and family. We are truly blessed and know that you will continue to stand with us as we pray and look forward to afull recovery with total mobility in Daniel's body. With certainty, medical bills will start to pile up, resulting in additional stress in an already stressful situation.  We have no idea what this will amount to. We have no idea what the future holds in terms of what Daniel will be able to do. So many of you have already asked if there is anything that you can personally do. Pray. Please continue to pray for Daniel's body to be fully restored, for his mind to be restored, and for our family to heal. We humbly ask, if you are able, would you consider making a donation of any amount to help cover the cost of insurance deductibles, copayments, rehabilitation, and medical expenses. We really have no idea how much this could end up costing, especially in the long term. Our family would be so appreciative. Thank you! God Bless you! And Please keep praying!Read more"

Doug’s 10yo son, Jett was riding on the back and luckily while being thrown from the bike and knocked unconscious, managed to walk away with minor injuries.

Doug suffered a massive abdominal laceration, fractured vertebrae, and he has a SERIOUS life threatening Open Book Pelvic Fracture. Open book pelvic fractures are very dangerous and associated with abdominal, vascular and nervous injuries requiring a multidisciplinary team for its management. Doug is currently in ICU in critical condition. He has lost a lot of blood and has received nearly twice the amount of blood a human carries in their system. He has already had two surgeries to stop internal bleeding, reconstruction of his pelvis and close up the abdominal wound. He is at risk of blood clots, internal infection, and pneumonia. He is heavily sedated and is fighting for his life. Doug will be in the hospital for many more days and faces a long road of rehabilitation.

His son Jett has been very brave. He woke from being unconscious, got out of the road and called his mother. She was in the area and able to get to the scene quickly. Jett was taken to the hospital, but only suffered bumps, bruises, and a hairline fracture in his foot. It’s been rough on him having witnessed his father gravely injured in the road. The drunk driver was completely uninjured, but could not even muster the humanity to get out of his car to check on the injured.

Doug is very well regarded in his community. He work with Sugar Bowl Ski Patrol in the 80's. He has a strong connection with the whitewater rafting community, having started a raft guide schools in the 80's and 90's with Roger Lee (long time friend). He is also well known for his production work on many reality shows. He was instrumental in the creation of Deadliest Catch and won many Emmy's for his work on the show. He donates much of his time to various causes, including recent work on salmon restoration on the American River.

Please consider donating whatever you can to help with the enormous costs he will be facing from the hospital stay and long rehabilitation ahead of him.

At the end of the day before loading our bikes into truck, we decided on one last ride.I was out front of the pack, and riding fast, when suddenly I lost control and launched off the trail. I was in 5th gear when my bike and I left the trail crashing down a mountainside at high speed.I was thrown off the Kawasaki KX250 motorcycle, and as I flew through the air I knew it was going to hurt. I smashed face first into a large rock, splitting my fox helmet and knocking off the visor. It was the most pain I have ever felt, and my legs scorpioned over my head as I crashed.My friends were about 5 minutes behind me, and the first rider, Will approached the corner I missed. He saw my bike close to the trail and me laying face down 30 feet downhill from the trail. The lower half of my body was in a small cold creek and I was concious but unable to move.He dropped his bike on the trail and descended the mountain to help me. He was very upset when he got close seeing how severely I was hurt and knew I needed medical attention right away if I was going to survive.Blood was filling up my lungs from all the facial breaks, but I decided I wasn't dying on that trail. I instructed him to call 911 and he reached into my pocket to get my cell phone out. He noticed that my lower half of my body was twisted in more than normal range of motion.I didn't know at the time but my spine was broke in 3 areas, broken ribs, and several breaks in my face. I needed help fast. He called 911 and emergency services were dispatched to our remote location and it was getting dark out.I asked him to remove my helmet, to allow me to breathe as my head was swelling fast. Search and rescue arrived first with an ambulance, to the staging area. The paramedics were led to the crash site by my other riding friend Jim who ensured they found me as quickly as possible.Will stayed by my side, and was there to keep me talking, the paramedics arrived and Will flagged them down with the flashlight on my iPhone. They assessed my injury.They immediately called for an air ambulance, and a helicopter was dispatched. Since we were in such a steep location, it couldn't land, and I was stretcher-boarded up the mountain to be driven down to the parking area.I was airlifted to Vancouver General Hospital, and was having trouble breathing during the flight, they had to punch a hole in my neck to allow air to flow. At this time I was in a huge shock, and couldn't feel my legs or move my arms, and my head was swollen double its size.The Dr. informed me that I needed an emergency face surgery, and I later found out it was a 13 and a 1/2 hour procedure. The surgery went well, and I was in ICU for the next 3 weeks to help me recover with the face the size of a large pumpkin.I had broken my two eyesockets, upper and lower jaw, both mandibles, nose and behind the nose, and fractured the back of my skull (basilla fracture) upon impact of that rock, as well as had some brain bleeding.My spine was broken in 3 separate areas, I will post an update of the exact areas.this has left me paralyzed from the waste down which has also required I learn how to use a wheelchair.After graduating from ICU and becoming more medically stable, I was transferred to spine step down unit which is just below ICU status and met with many specialists. Once a bed was available I was transferred to GF Strong spinal rehabilitation centre where I would continue to heal.I spent over 4 months at GF strong, learning how to eat again and move my hands and arms, with lots of physiotherapy and wonderful/kind nurses. I then was discharged home where I am continuing to recover, with my brother and wonderful girlfriend by my side.It has been a very steep learning curve and very difficult recovery over the last months, but my will to recover is strong, as well as the desire to regain full independence.I have just returned from a successful nerve transfer surgery Nov 18th, that was 5 hours total surgery time at UBC Vancouver hospital to allow more use of my hands and arms, Pictures to come. This will take 6-9 months to heal and be effective, and I am excited to have my triceps working soon.This urgent Fundraiser's purpose is to help me with the costs of modifying my home to make it wheelchair friendly, afford medical equipment that we are lacking, and to help with several new expenses that are a result of the crash so thatIcan heal up fast and returnThe carpet will be removed in our home to allow my wheelchair to roll easier, and the bathroom will be heavily modified to allow a roll in shower and adapted for wheelchair use.I will also be purchasing and modifying a vehicle to allow hand controls, once I am able to manage a wheelchair to car transfer.Before this accidentIwas working as a Carpenter, building houses both residential and commercial from foundation to finish. I would love to continue in home building as it is my passion. I am planning to get back to work as soon as possible and continue my carpentry career. I am raising capital to move my workshop from Aggasiz to Kelowna. Not working for 6 months has been difficult financially, butI am determined to besuccessful after this setback.I want to thank each and every front line staff, paramedic and Doctor who helped me survive this crash, my wonderful girlfriend who has stuck by my side, and my riding friends Will and Jim, who made it possible to get emergency help to the crash site.I want to Thank you for taking time to read this and for any donations, it took a lot of courage to survive this crash and even more courage to ask for help.

I hope everyone is keeping well this winter and have had a decent start to 2021, after what has been a trying and difficult year for us all.Sadly, it has been especially tough for our family, because our much-loved Tasha suffered from a brain aneurysm just before Christmas 2019, and has been in a healthcare facility ever since.Doctors saved her life through prompt surgery that stopped a bleed in her brain, but there have been a series of complications. This has seen Tasha withstand 15 additional operations on her brain, as doctors tried to heal her for good.And while she is out of immediate danger, she is still severely compromised, unable to vocalize, needing a feeding tube for nourishment and struggling to move physically – she cannot walk.We are thankful for the medical expertise that has saved her life and are now looking ahead.TASHA'S REHAB NEEDS:Tasha needs expert rehabilitation and special equipment to enable her to continue her recovery – regaining, we hope, her voice, her ability to enjoy food normally, and her mobility.She is currently enrolled in a Complex Continuing Care Program at a rehabilitation centre , in Toronto. It is one of North America’s leading rehabilitation sciences centres, so she in good hands.While this centre’s costs are partially covered by OHIP (Ontario’s public health care system), there is a co-pay amount that must be provided by the patient/family. We anticipate that this co-pay requirement might also apply to any subsequent facilities that Tasha is moved to, such as a more intensive rehab facility or a facility closer to home.When that happens, we need to be ready. There is every chance that we will need to contribute to funding her next stage of recovery.The last thing we want is for Tasha to be denied the resources she needs to reverse the damage of her brain injury and regain as much quality of life as she can. Once the healthcare facilities start to allow more access as we navigate this COVID-19 virus, the family will be looking to supplement Tasha’s care with third party therapies and treatments. Further down the road, there may be renovations required in the home.To do this will take money. Of course, we are directing our own resources and savings into funding her care, but we are anticipating that we may not be able to afford all the specialists and equipment to give Tasha the best chances of recovery.Some of the expenses we may encounter for Tasha's best chances for recovering are:3rd Party Therapy- Extra Physiotherapy- Neurological focused brain therapy- Naturopathic therapists, vitality boosting, acupuncture, homeopathic treatmentsEquipment (short & long term)- Wheelchair (potentially motorized)- Stability and walking aids- Transfer equipment- Grab bars (at bedside, washrooms, hallways)- Accessible ramps- Stair chairsOther- Travel and accommodations- Personal care (requiring a different level of efforts)- Other consultants- In home care giverNOTE: This is just what we know as potential recovery supports today, this list may grow, and we will truly need financial help.APPEAL FOR HELP!So, friends and family, we are asking for your help. Anything you can give to help Tasha would be much appreciated and gratefully received. However, we really want to meet our campaign goal so we are asking/hoping for gifts of $100 per donor, but any amount will be 100% very well receivedgift.I, as Tasha’s sister-in-law, have set up a GoFundMe account to help Tasha and her husband, Christian, as he helps his lovely wife.COVID-19 has isolated us from her and him, and Christian is handling much of Tasha’s emotional support solo, driving from Barrie, where he has been holding down a full-time job, to Toronto any time he can. I have seen the love and devotion of Christian, and the amazing love that exists between them. The reality is that the loss of Tasha’s job as community event planner means Christian has had to meet existing financial commitments himself, and so additional medical and rehab bills will be especially tough to handle this year.We’re making a one-off appeal so we can be in good shape to help Tasha, and Christian this year.Please browse our GOFUNDME page and help.GOFUND ME allows you to donate anonymously if you wish, leave messages, post photos, however you would like to engage this fundraiser, there is a platform for all well wishes, donations, and loving thoughts.This will be a long fight for Tasha and her family. But with all the support we have received and wish for in the future, we hope we can enable her to recover from this terrible tragedy. Tasha is still fighting to get better. Tasha is a battler, as you know.           Please help us stand with her.Please share this with everyone, share on FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM and TWITTER to spread the word, any and all support is so appreciated.We love you endlessly Tasha & Christian XO.Read more"

Her dream is to become a teacher. We are reaching out to the community to help her realize this dream after recently suffering catastrophic complications during aortic valve replacement surgery last month.Bridget was born with several congenital heart defects requiring heart surgery at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 15 years of age. The surgery to replace her valve was on May 15, 2017. She has required regular cardiac care throughout her life but never let health concerns stop her from doing what she wanted to do. While at CUA she was a member of the sailing team, was very active with campus ministry, tutored for DC READS and went on a service trip to Jamaica.After a routine cardiac checkup revealed aortic stenosis, Bridget planned to have her valve replaced, recover over the summer and return to CUA in the fall to student teach and graduate with her class in May 2018. Unfortunately, Bridget suffered irreversible damage to her heart during the surgery, which meant the only option for life was a heart transplant. She was on extraordinary life support measures from May 15, 2017 until May 25, 2017. Bridget was listed for a heart with Gift of Life on May 24, and miraculously a match was made in 6 hours, and she underwent heart transplant surgery on May 25, 2017. She also suffered compartment syndrome of her left leg from complications during the initial surgery. She underwent several surgeries to try and save her leg, which unfortunately were not successful. Her leg had to be amputated on June 12, 2017. She is recovering from transplant but will require lifelong anti-rejection medication, heart biopsies and follow up. She is facing a prolonged care and rehabilitation because of the combined recovery from transplant and amputation.She has been in the hospital for over a month at this point and will require an extended stay in the University of Pennsylvania’s rehabilitation hospital. The cost of housing while hospitalized and at rehab, prosthetics and handicap accessibility of her home will be great. She will require a great deal of care, for which her mother is taking a leave from work and will lose her full-time income. Sadly, Bridget’s college and life course is changing, but with the help of her family, friends, and community we are hoping for the best recovery possible. The outpouring of love, concern and prayer throughout her illness has been truly amazing and we are very grateful. It cannot be denied that prayer is powerful when looking at the timing of quick transplantation with perfect matching for Bridget. During this time, family, friends and strangers have continually asked “What can we do to help?” We are asking now for your generosity and help by contributing to our fund to “Get Bridget Back on her Feet!”Thank you for taking the time to read our campaign and feel free to inquire about Bridget’s progress!Read more"

Evenduring his short time in Philadelphia, Aaron has become an influential memberof the PhiladelphiaGAA. On Saturday, August 26, Aaron was out in Jenkintown and was struck down by a car.Aaron was found unresponsive without a pulse. With the help of the local police department, who provided CPR until the paramedics arrived, hestarted to breathewhile still unconscious. He was taken to Abington Memorial Hospital where he was rushed in for emergency surgerybecause he suffered a severe compound fractureleaving the elbow shattered. Once this was cleaned and covered, he was taken to the neuro critical care unit (surgical trauma)where he stills remains. Because of a blood clot, leak in the brain, and a fractured skull, he was placed under high sedation. Initially,after a number of CT scans and speaking tovarious doctors and surgeons, it was found thebleedinggot worse leaving him in extreme critical condition. After several hours and another CT scan,the bleeding slowed down showing a bruise in the brain, while the clot remained the same. On Sundayafternoon, while still heavily sedated, Aaron went through a minor surgery wherehis compound fracture woundwas cleaned. On Tuesday, Aaron had another surgerywhere they inserted a chest tubeto help alleviate stress on his right lung as the left lung had collapsed. The current focus is stabilizingAaron's breathing and assessing his brain function, the reconstruction surgery for his elbowis planned for September 1st.At the moment, rest is crucial for Aaron. The doctorshave removed him from sedation in order to check his brain activity and reaction toinstructions by the medical staff, for example, ""squeeze my hand"" or ""show me your thumb"". The Kevin Barry's GFC organized two airfare tickets for Aaron's family members to be with him at the recommendation of the medical staff. Aaron will remain in the hospital for a minimum of six weeksat the recommendation ofhisneurosurgeon. Once he is released from the hospital, Aaron will require intenserehabilitation without health insurance; so these funds will be deposited into a bank account in Aaron Elliott's name for all living expenses and medical expenses incurred during his recovery. Any help that you can provide will go towards the extensive care and recovery that Aaronwillendure throughout this recovery period.Aaron is already on the road to recovery, but he still has a long way to go so look out for other opportunities to support Aaron witha fundraiser on October 8th in Philadelphia at the Irish Center.

Almost everyone in the Mascoma Valley area knows Ken Stanford. For years he was the purveyor of hardware goods at Enfield Hardware. Always a friendly face. Always a terrible Dad Joke on hand. Always there. Until it was time to shut the doors.



He retired, but then picked up a couple jobs in the area to make ends meet. Many of his longtime customers found him doing what he does best at Tractor Supply. Still a friendly face, still doing what needed to be done, even in these uncertain times.



On January 7, Ken was admitted to DHMC with COVID-19. Though he no longer has COVID, he remains in the hospital and needs a lot of rehabilitation before he can be sent home. It will be months before he might be able to work, if he is able to work again.



With Ken being in the hospital, that means no paychecks. Bills still need to be paid and the medical bill is going to be shocking.



Emily is doing the best she can, but it is time to ask for some help. Help from the community that Ken and Emily call home.

I immediately pulled him from the water, called 911, and administered CPR. He left the house via paramedics and they were able to get a very slight pulse before putting him in the ambulance.

Here is what we've come to know:

My dad was either born with spinal stenosis or it may have occurred with age- though he is only 56 years old. Spinal stenosis is an ongoing narrowing of the canals within your spine and over time it will cause pressure on the nerves that travel through the spine. Spinal stenosis occurs most often in the lower back and the neck.

That said, his higher cervical spine was weakened due to the stenosis and any trauma to that area would have triggered a heightened amount of damage. The doctors believe he suffered a spinal cord injury from hitting his head in or on the pool, thus causing instant paralysis. They do believe the paralysis occurred right before he hit the water, hence, causing the near drowning- which then brought on a cardiac arrest.

Though he is in stable condition and is responding to questions by blinking we are not out of the woods yet. He's showing minimal trauma to the brain. He can follow a pen with his eyes and move his head back and forth. They believe he may be able to talk, but we won’t know that until he comes off the ventilator.

What's most concerning is that he's not showing much movement in his legs or arms. He has lifted his right forearm but is barely lifting his left hand off the bed. He can move his feet but has not been able to lift his legs. He has a contusion (bruising) on the spinal cord which they think is causing the overall paralysis. Unfortunately, the bruising on the spinal cord does not regenerate as the rest of our body does.

Friday night he underwent spinal surgery to decompress the spine and the Dr. was happy to report that he did not need to add rods or screws to stabilize the spine. He has had significant swelling and is being treated with diuretics which seems to be working. His heart is enlarged on the right side as well.



It's going to be a long road and only time will tell as to his recovery. Currently, they are trying to wean him off the ventilator, but he hasn’t passed the test yet so they will keep trying into next week. At that time, if he can’t be weaned off the machine, he may need a tracheotomy so he can breathe better. The breathing is difficult as our breathing tube runs through the same small space where the contusion is located in the high cervical spine. Additionally, he currently has pneumonia that they are treating with the “big gun” antibiotics.

He is looking at approximately 18 to 24 months in a rehabilitation facility to see if he’ll be able to regain any additional movement from the neck down.Today I was able to visit him and he did recognize me which felt amazing. We are all hoping and praying. As I mentioned, it's going to be a long road, but we are thankful we are able to travel this road together.


I'm reaching out to friends and family with this post to GoFundMe, seeking your help in donations. Themoneywill go towards his medical and life expenditures. Any amount you are able to give would be much appreciated.


This has been a highly emotional and scary week for my sister and I as well as for our entire family. We ask that you give us a bit of time and privacy to process what has happened. We would be grateful beyond measure for any and all prayers, good wishes, and love you can send his way.

For those of you that don’t know Ruben, he’s our beautiful 9 year old miracle boy, surprising us with his presence 9 weeks early, and he’s been surprising us ever since!

Ruben was diagnosed with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy just before the age of 2. In layman’s terms this means that because of damage to the brain, the muscles in Ruben’s legs are tight causing him to walk up on his toes, in turn making every day tasks pretty tricky.

Over the past few years we have been treating the spasticity in Ruben’s legs with botox injections and serial casting. This method relaxes the muscles and then stretches them through the casting. We get a small window where Ruben can walk with his heels on the ground which improves his balance and gait - but it wears off quickly and we start all over again!

Supported by Ruben’s medical team in Newcastle, we are applying for life changing Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy Surgey in Boston, United States and we need help tomake this dream a reality!

During SDR a neurosurgeon makes a small cut in the upper lumbar region of the spine and removes a small section of bone to expose the nerve roots as they leave the spinal cord. Looking through a microscope, the surgeon then separates the nerve roots into groups, finding those that bring sensation back from the legs and leaving the motor nerves aside.

The surgeon tests each sensory nerve root in turn by stimulating it electrically, while a specialist called an electrophysiologist monitors the response in the child's leg muscles. If the nerve responses are abnormal, these nerve roots may be selectively cut.

The operation releases tone in the muscles, initially this can expose underlying weakness that has been masked by the spasticity. Intensive rehabilitation is required post operation.Without this surgery, there is a chance that Ruben will decline as he gets older as he battles against the spasticity, he may require a walking frame or wheel chair.

Unfortunately this surgery is not available to Ruben in Australia, and we are far behind America & the UK who are leading the way and changing lives for kids with CP!

Ruben is a great kid. He is a kind, funny outgoing little guy who is wise beyond his 9 year old self! He loves music, football, WWE and is obsessed with Kath & Kim and does all of their best quotes!

As his parents we think he is perfect just the way his is - but we want to make his daily life that little bit easier!This operation will be self funded, the operation itself around $60,000 USD, we will also have travel & rehab costs needing to spend around 4 weeks in the States.

We will be running some fundraising events and will share the details of those soon. In the meantime if you can make a donation to Ruben’s dream through this Go-Fund me page!

As some of you may know, my brother-in-law Jesse was involved in a freak dirt bike accident on August 17th. On an otherwise normal summer evening, Jesse, my sister Amy and my 5 year old nephew Brantley were outside doing what they love most, riding dirt bikes and playing outside. Before putting the bike away, it was “5 more minutes” that would change life as we know it. Jesse was not able to stop the bike and although he is an experienced rider and was wearing a helmet, the crash resulted in heavy bleeding from facial injury and traumatic brain injury. As he was being transported to the hospital, a blood clot formed at the base of his skull which resulted in a brain stem stroke.Jesse was stabilized after a few days in the ICU which gave us all some relief, but the world stopped when we received the news that as a result of the brain stem stroke, Jesse was ""Locked-In."" Locked in Syndrome (LIS) is an extremely rare neurological condition that effects less than 1% of stroke victims. Most survivors of LIS cannot move any muscles voluntarily or communicate, except with their eyes. LIS patients can think and reason, but are unable to speak or move. Had the stroke not happened, Jesse could have walked away from this accident with just bumps and bruises. Unfortunately, this would not be the case.After his first few weeks spent in the ICU on a ventilator fighting to stay alive, Jesse quickly realized he could communicate by blinking his eyes. He then discovered the use of an alphabet board to form words and later sentences...again, just by blinking his eyes. In October, Jesse was transferred to Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago where he began to talk, something we were told would be highly unlikely to ever happen again due to his locked-in state.After 5 months post-accident, Jesse was able to return home in early January. While we are all incredibly grateful that he is able to live at home now with the support of his family and the ability to finally see and talk to those he loves the most, we are facing many challenges in regard to his care. Amy has put her 12 year career on hold and has taken on the full-time role as Jesse's caretaker, as well as full-time parent to Brantley. Jesse has worked hard his entire life and is fortunate to have wonderful insurance, but as you can imagine, his continued care at home and rehabilitation will require significantly more than insurance will cover.Despite the traumatic brain injury, Jesse's brain has remained cognitively fully intact (we actually think he is even sharper and more witty than before the accident!) Through speech, occupational and physical therapy Jesse has had to reprogram is brain. At this point, Jesse still requires a tracheotomy tube to assist breathing and a feeding tube to eat. He has recovered some motor ability, but he is currently wheelchair bound. Jesse is determined and motivated to keep advancing and proving his prognosis wrong. We know he is a survivor and he has already proven this by fighting since August to defy all the odds stacked against him. Jesse will require continuous outpatient physical and occupational therapy, speech therapy, nutrition counseling as well as many other medical appointments multiple times a week. Transportation will be required to all of these appointments, along with medical supplies and medical equipment rental. Our goal is to keep providing Jesse the resources he needs to keep improving so that he has the best possible chance to walk, eat, drive, etc. all of the ""luxuries"" we take for granted every day. Brantley’s wish is for his dad to be able to play outside again. Amy and Jesse, still newlyweds just shy of their 1 year wedding anniversary before this tragic accident happened, have so much more life to experience together.Creating this GoFundMe page and your donations will provide financial assistance for Jesse’s continued medical expenses, therapy and care. No donation is too small and we are extremely grateful to anyone that donates and helps us share Jesse's story. Our hope is to some day in some measure pay it forward and share Jesse's success to give hope to others with the devastating prognosis of LIS. Anyone who knows Jesse knows that despite his own battle, he will continue to do anything in his power to help others in the future.*Additionally, we cannot thank the team at Aurora Summit ICU and Shirley Ryan AbilityLab for taking care of Jesse. Due to COVID-19 visitor restrictions, we have had to rely on nurses, doctors and other caregivers to care for him as if he was their own family member. You are all amazing for what you so selflessly do every day and Jesse being here with us today is because of YOU*THANK YOU!!!

Before her fall, she managed to get a call off to her parents who rang 000. Two ambulances were sent to our house and four paramedics broke in to get to Nicole.She was rushed to the Austin hospital where she went straight into theatre for emergency surgery on her brain. The surgery went for over 8 hours. Nicole’s lungs and heart were not working properly and the doctors needed to do everything that they could to save Nicole’s life. In order for the doctors to save Nicole, our baby had to be delivered. At 22 weeks, our gorgeous baby boy, Ned Roland Gallacher, went straight up to heaven.Nicole spent the next couple of weeks in ICU on life support. Things were not looking good but she fought hard and showed some miraculous improvement, which has absolutely amazed all of the doctors and nurses in the ICU and the neuro ward. She moved from ICU to the neuro ward where she was working on getting some speech and movement back.Nicole then had to have a very complicated procedure on her brain last Tuesday, followed by further surgery on her brain last Wednesday. This surgery was to cut the abnormal mass out of her brain and a series of very serious and scary risks associated with the Tuesday procedure and Wednesday surgery was explained to us.Both the procedure and the surgery were a great success. Nicole fought hard and pulled through once again. She then spent a few more days in ICU before moving back to the neuro ward, where she is currently.She is now working on her speech, swallowing, and getting some movement back. In technical terms, Nicole suffered a stroke and has a long road of rehab and recovery ahead. The team at the Austin will work with her over the coming weeks to try and get her strong enough to then transfer to a rehabilitation facility.Before I finish this post, although my words will not do justice, I just want to say how brilliant, amazing and incredible the nurses and doctors are in the ICU at the Austin. They are absolute bloody angels and are worth a hell of a lot more than their weight in gold.Similarly, the emergency team, who kept her with us on that very first night, and the doctors and nurses who have been looking after her in the neuro ward. Also, the neurosurgeons, who managed to cut the entire malformation out of Nicole’s brain in a marathon surgery that took the entire day on Wednesday.These are absolutely incredible people and we will be forever in their debt.It is far from over for Nicole. We have a long road of rehab ahead of us which is going to take a long time but we are so lucky with the love and support that we have around us.""Nicole has now been in the rehabilitation hospital for over two months and will still be in there for a substantial amount of time.We can't even begin to imagine the stress they would be under right now and know that they have many more challenges to overcome in the coming months. Dave is spending most of his time between work and the hospital at the moment. Nicole will be needing specialised equipment and support when she is discharged and they still have their everyday expenses to take into account. So we thought it might be of great help to them if we (family and friends) could help relieve some of their financial burden. You can put in $2, $10, $50, $1000 as much as you can at the moment to help these two amazing individuals. Anything will be appreciated no matter how little.All funds raised will go towards supporting Dave and Nicole with the financial burdens they currently face and will encounter in the future. Nicole will be unable to work for the foreseeable future. Modifications will need to be made to their house to enable Nicole to return home. Once Nicole is able to return home she will need ongoing therapy from a range of specialists including physiotherapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy. Any money raised will go towards these things as well as supporting Dave and Nicole to meet mortgage repayments, bills etcP.S:We know that not everyone can help financially so if you would like to donate some of your time instead that would be of great help too. There are plenty of jobs to be done like gardening and cooking. If you think you can help in this way shoot us an email or facebook message so that we can liaise with Dave's family.Read more"

Shortly after her arrival, she lost consciousness. Upon performing an MRI, 2 separate brain hemorrhages were detected from what was suspected to be 2 aneurysms. The hemorrhages were so extensive that she would not have survived if she hadn’t already been at the hospital. She was rushed to surgery, where a piece of her skull was removed to relieve the pressure. She then needed a second emergency surgery Friday night, where the larger of the 2 clots (100cc) was removed.Jessica has been on a ventilator plus other tubes and drains since 2/18. She is still mostly unconscious and remains in the ICU, but she’s slowly showing signs that she will survive this tragedy.Jessica has 8 children at home, ranging in age from 4 to 17, whom she homeschools. She is an incredible and selfless mother, wife, sister, daughter, granddaughter, aunt, niece, cousin, and overall human being, and is a fearless and staunch supporter in the LGBTQ community.Jessica has suffered many health/medical issues throughout her 36 years (Graves’ Disease, EDS (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome), and was recently diagnosed with POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) to name a few). She suffered a carotid artery dissection in 2013 as a result of complications from EDS.This time, however, things are different - her doctors don’t yet know how much brain damage she will suffer, and she is facing up to 2 years of rehabilitation. Her husband Brad works full-time, and is also a volunteer firefighter/First Responder. They had already taken a hit to his income because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and now he faces what must feel like an almost insurmountable hurdle - working to support their family, ensuring their 8 children continue their home-based education, and caring for Jessica once she has recovered enough to finally come home.Funds raised will be used for non-covered medical/related expenses, plus other living expenses that will become a challenge due to loss of income that Brad will undoubtedly face by taking additional time off from his job to tend to their family’s needs and Jessica’s care.Every penny donated will be greatly appreciated as the family stays strong and finds their way through this dark and challenging time.We thank you for taking the time to read this, and for your love and generosity!Read more"

His strong, fighting spirit has won battles in the critical early days and he continues to do so daily, leading many medics along the way to call him a Miracle.Cian is now at a stage where he needs extensive rehabilitation therapy to regain mobility, motor skills and speech. This will enable him to experience life to the fullest as every child should; being able to play the games he loved and communicating with his family and friends.At his most recent discharge from the National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH), in November 2020, it was advised that Cian needs weekly intensive Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, and Speech & Language Therapy to enable his recovery and optimise his potential for success. His Temple St. Consultant also identified these therapies as critical needs for Cian to enable him to achieve the best possible outcomes. He will continue to need these services for many years to come with estimated costs in the region of €15-20k per annum.Cian and his family have come so far but still have a long and arduous road ahead. This fundraising page has been set up to ask for your help, to get Cian these crucial therapies.From the bottom of our hearts we thank you for your support in helping Cian continue his journey of recovery from Stroke.Cian’s Story:Cian is a mischievous, fun-loving, sensitive, strong, independent 7-year-old boy. He is third in a family of 4 siblings, cherished by their parents, Mike & Olivia.On the morning of May 6th, 2019 his parents struggled to wake him and rushed him to Limerick A&E, where they were told that Cian was after having a stroke. He was 6 years old. It was the day their world changed forever.Later they learned it was caused by a reaction to the Chicken Pox virus, which happens to 1 in 100,000 children. Cian hadn’t shown any visible signs of Chicken Pox and wasn’t sick, he hadn’t missed a day of Junior Infants up to this. From Limerick A&E, Cian was transferred to Crumlin Hospital but due to multiple clots his condition deteriorated on route and when he reached Crumlin, he was rushed into emergency surgery. The Surgeon explained the severity of the situation. He had never carried out this procedure on a child of Cian’s age before and his medical devices were sized for adults. Cian was given a 20% chance of survival.Following his surgery, Cian was kept in an Induced Coma in the hope that the swelling to his brain would reduce. On Thursday night Cian was taken for an emergency brain scan and then came news that no parent ever wants to hear, Cian was given hours to live. It was only a matter of time before the swelling would cut off his oxygen. It was advised to get all his siblings to see him; Siύn (10 years), Michael (9 years), and Tadhg (9 months).The only option was craniotomy surgery to remove the left side of Cian’s skull bone in the hope that the extra space would reduce pressure on his brain. The removed piece of skull bone would be placed in his stomach for safekeeping with the hope of reinserting it safely at a later date. Even with this option, his parents were advised that he would most likely still have serious brain damage.
The surgery felt like an eternity. Afterwards, the surgeon remarked “the ball is in Cian’s court” and with that, we knew in our hearts that Cian would fight for every inch. His strong, stubborn, competitiveness, and fighting spirit took over, and against the odds, he pulled through.After a critical week in Crumlin's Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Cian was transferred across the city to the ICU in Temple St. Hospital. The move was a positive one, with Cian showing slow but steady signs of improvement; coming off the ventilator and breathing for himself. During those early days, the flicker of an eyelid, twitch of a muscle and squeeze of a finger were all much-cherished experiences.Cian was moved to St. Gabriel's Ward, where he was gradually weaned off medication and when he woke up, he was unable to speak, move, or do anything for himself. He would have to re-learn everything.Very early the decision was made by Cian’s family that he would not be left alone and would have someone with him 24/7. With the amazing support of family, friends, employers, and Hugh’s House (accommodation for parents of long-term patients), his parents stayed by his side.His parents advocated on his behalf, communicated for him, and performed all his care needs. They turned him every 3 hours in bed, fed him by an NG tube, used a hoist to lift him, bathed him, and did anything else he needed. They also learned and experienced how much a person can communicate with their eyes alone. Together, they all began the slow journey of rehabilitation.After a month, Cian had further neurosurgery, where his skull bone flap was successfully reinserted. He had a left-side brain injury which resulted in right-side body weakness. He was still unable to speak and was now a wheelchair user, with new daily struggles and challenges.


With the help of Bumbleance (Children’s Ambulance Service), Cian made his first weekend trip home to Tipperary at the end of July. 

He started to stay in hospitalMonday-Fridayfor rehabilitation therapies and get home at weekends to his family, where he continued to make gains.It was at home (the day Tipp won the All-Ireland) that Cian took his first steps, once again moving the goalposts and surprising medical staff, some admitting they never anticipated this happening. The good news was Cian was now too well to be a patient in a clinical hospital setting such as Temple St. The bad news was a bed was still unavailable in the National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH), which was where Cian needed to be.In mid-September, after 5 months, Cian was discharged home from St. Gabriel's Ward, Temple Street, to continue his rehabilitation journey with Local services, while waiting on the NRH.None of Cian’s journey has been easy but unfortunately, this was when Cian’s family experienced first-hand what others had forewarned them; Children’s Disability Services in North Tipperary are under-resourced and unable to meet Cian’s needs.During his time at Temple Street, Cian had been receiving 10-15 therapies weekly, including daily Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy (OT) and Speech & Language Therapy (SLT). At discharge, Doctors advised that he needed to continue to receive this level of therapy.Although Local Services categorised Cian as a Priority 1, they could only offeroneweekly therapy (a tenth of his requirement to progress). The following months saw Cian at home in the care of his parents, amid much anguish, despair, and frustration at the lack of services available. At the end of November, he was admitted to the NRH for intensive rehabilitation. He responded very well to therapies and made progress.
In February, Cian was discharged home from the NRH to continue his rehabilitation with local services and with a plan to return to the NRH in April/May. Then COVID struck and local public children’s disability services stopped operating. While back in Tipperary, between February and October 2020, Cian met with a Physiotherapist three times and once with a Speech and Language Therapist. Due to COVID, Cian’s re-admission to the NRH was delayed until October. By then his range of movement had deteriorated since his discharge in February due to lack of therapeutic intervention. Thankfully, Cian responded again during his four weeks there, proving the benefits of regular and consistent rehabilitation therapies.At his most recent discharge from the Paediatric Daisy Unit of the NRH, on 7th November 2020, it was advised that Cian needs weekly intensive Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, and Speech & Language Therapy to enable his recovery and optimise his potential for success. He will continue to need these services for many years to come. On 24th November 2020, his Temple St. Consultant also identified these therapies as critical needs for Cian to enable him to achieve the best possible outcomes in everyday life.There is no way of knowing to what level Cian will recover but his best potential for success is with regular rehabilitation therapies. As one Consultant advised, the rehabilitation journey is a marathon and not a sprint.

Cian is now 19 months post Stroke and continues to be as strong, resilient, and mischievous as ever. He is a “character” with a great sense of humour and a very social child. He loves being with his friends and having fun. Some of his favourite characters are “Mr. Bean”, “The Simpson’s”, “Denis the Menace” and he loves a good prank. He is also a Pokémon fanatic.Cian has an Acquired Brain Injury, which is often an “invisible” injury. Fatigue has a huge impact, and he needs to work so much harder to concentrate and participate in daily activities we all take for granted, including everyday games and interaction with his friends and siblings.Although some speech has returned, Cian now has acquired language learning difficulties. Though he knows and understands what he wants to say, sometimes he cannot say what he wants to say or the wrong word will come out. Other times speech will be slurred and unclear. This can cause great frustration for him in everyday activities and communication. However, this can be helped with regular Speech and Language therapy.He continues to have a right-side weakness but has regained mobility and can be seen playing with his siblings and friends. However, he struggles to climb, and it can be a challenge to get into different vehicles, get into a bath, or use some playground equipment. Prior to Stroke, Cian was a very active child. Some of the activities he enjoyed were climbing, cycling, playing soccer, hurling and rugby with local clubs. He had also started swimming lessons. He can no longer do all the things he could before his Stroke. Cian always had and continues to have high energy levels. He can experience frustration due to his current physical limitations. This can be helped with regular Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy.For his first 6 years, Cian was right-handed but he now has a forced change of hand dominance and is re-learning to do things with his left hand. He currently has no functional grasp in his right fingers or at the wrist. Cian needs assistance with dressing, feeding, opening things, carrying things and his daily care, although his attitude of “I do it myself” serves him well. He needs the professional intervention of Occupational Therapy to help learn, where possible to do everyday tasks in a new way and regain his independence. He also needs intensive OT to continue rehabilitation with his right arm and hand.Cian was in Junior Infants at the time of his Stroke and was only starting to learn to read and write, which he now has to relearn with new challenges. He missed a considerable amount of time in school due to hospitalisation and returning to school on reduced hours due to fatigue. He is now in 1st class in Lissenhall NS. Co. Tipperary and is blessed to be part of an amazing school community. He always loved school before his illness and continues to do so now. Cian faces increased challenges at school educationally, as a result of his Stroke and this will only become more evident in years to come.There have been many battles fought and tears shed, but more importantly, there have been many successes celebrated as Cian continues to improve and inspire us all. He has an amazing strength of character and despite the odds not always in his favour, he continues to move goalposts and surpass expectations. He is our real-life Superhero who shows us every day that life is for living.None of this journey has been easy and there is still a long road ahead for Cian and his family, with new challenges to face. We have received amazing support from friends, family, employers and community along the way, for which we will be forever grateful.We are forever indebted to the wonderful medical and rehabilitation staff who have brought Cian this far. Thank You for taking the time to read Cian’s story. We know that his Journey to Recovery is being made possible with your continued support.

It was a day much like any other for Steve at a time when the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic had made so many things far from normal. After saying goodbye to Steve, Collin would not speak to him for another seven days. In fact, no one would see or speak with Steve between March 30 and April 6. Steve returned home after hitting with Collin, and then, things took a terrible turn. Steve was in his apartment, where he lives alone, when he suffered a massive middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. No one knows when the stroke occurred, but his phone indicates that Steve failed to respond to calls and texts between April 1 and April 6. Growing concerned that Steve had not responded to them in several days, Collin and his brother David went to Steve’s apartment. There, they found him collapsed, disoriented, and confused. Steve was rushed by ambulance to the hospital.Many of you know Steve through tennis. He has touched the lives of innumerable people who have attended his clinics, taken lessons, or watched him teach their children. Steve has been a USPTA pro for 34 years and has been a fixture in the greater Washington, D.C. tennis community for decades. Steve is a teacher, coach, and mentor to tennis players of every age and skill level, and he is a friend to all.To spend an hour on the tennis court with Steve is to know him a lifetime. Students come to Steve to learn a game, and they leave with a lifelong friend. No matter if you are Steve’s first lesson of the day or his last after many hours on the court, Steve meets you with a big smile and genuine interest in you and your family. Anyone who has played on a court anywhere close to Steve has heard his billowing laugh. It is as infectious as it is genuine.Steve enjoys the game of tennis, but his real love is teaching, especially children. Countless players owe their college and high school tennis careers to Steve and even more look back fondly to spending hours learning from him. Ask any of them, and they will say that they are proud to be members of Team Parker.A stroke causes a sudden interruption of blood flow to the brain. In an MCA stroke, blood flow supplied by the middle cerebral artery, the largest artery in the brain, is cutoff (an infarction) by an ischemia (a blockage, clot, or constriction). As with any stroke, rapid diagnosis and treatment are essential to limiting damage. While no one knows exactly how long Steve waited to be found, it is clear that he was alone and suffering for several days as he lost valuable time for treatment. Most weeks, Steve teaches tennis seven days per week. The courts at which he teaches were closed to comply with coranavirus distancing measures. Had Steve been teaching on his normal schedule, he very likely would have been found much earlier.Doctors initially determined that Steve had lost the use of his right side and his ability to speak. The degree to which he was cognitively impaired was unknown. After being treated for seven days in the hospital, Steve was transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation center where he remains today. Coranavirus precautions have made it impossible for Steve to have any visitors in either facility. All of Steve’s students know he will work tirelessly to rehabilitate. He will push himself the way he has inspired so many of his students to work and grow. While Steve is beginning to try to vocalize and can take a few steps with the assistance of his therapist and a wide base quad cane, he has a long journey ahead of him. Unfortunately, there are no set timelines for recovery, and Steve faces the very real possibility that he will never regain full use of his body. Steve’s immediate goals focus on regaining some of his ability to communicate and use his right arm and leg. Success will be measured by the degree to which Steve will be able to function independently. At this point, it is hard to envision Steve returning to the tennis court, the place where he has earned his living for over 30 years. Coaches and instructors like Steve do not choose their profession for the money. It is a calling. It is also a profession that only pays when you work.Our campaign goal is $150,000. This will be used to assist Steve with the following expenses:· Medical and hospital bills· Rehabilitation bills· Durable medical equipment and ambulatory devices· Continued physical, occupational, and speech therapy· Home health assistance· Living expensesThank you for reading Steve’s story. In these days of the Coronavirus pandemic, we are witnessing suffering of every type, and many people are in need. If you know Steve, please consider his selfless nature and the countless hours he has devoted to people like you and the many children who fondly call him Coach Steve. If you do not, please consider helping a truly generous person who now must rely on others’ generosity.We appreciate any help, no matter how large or small. Please help us get the word out by sharing our campaign on social media (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) and with your friends. We will update this page on Steve’s progress and the use of funds. If you have any questions, please contact [email redacted].#HelpCoachSteve #CoachSteve #JoinTeamParkerFrequently Asked Questions1. Who are you and why are you starting the Help Get Coach Steve Parker Back in the Game Campaign?The Help Get Coach Steve Parker Back in the Game campaign was established by Gary Kessler and Collin Parker. Gary and his daughter are among Steve’s many students. Like so many of his students, they greatly value Steve’s teaching and friendship and are proud members of Team Parker. Collin Parker is Steve’s younger brother. Gary and Collin established this campaign to assist Steve with the expenses associated with his treatment and rehabilitation as well as his lost income. 2. Who will administer the funds raised by the campaign?Steve’s brother Collin Parker will hold and administer all funds raised by the campaign until Steve is able to attend to his personal affairs.3. Does Steve have health and disability insurance?Unfortunately, Steve held neither health nor disability insurance at the time he suffered his stroke. His brother Collin Parker has applied for Medicaid on Steve’s behalf to assist Steve with future medical expenses.4. Was Steve’s stroke caused by COVID-19 (coronavirus)?We do not know. Steve was not tested for coronavirus during his stay at the hospital. At the time, it was not widely understood that a stroke could be caused by the COVID-19 virus. Although Steve later tested negative for active virus at the rehabilitation center, he has not undergone an antibody test to determine if he previously had the virus that causes COVID-19. 5.  How is Steve progressing?Steve is receiving inpatient occupational, physical, and speech therapy at a rehabilitation center. Steve is beginning to try to vocalize and can take a few steps with the assistance of his therapist and a wide base quad cane. Steve currently has nominal use of his right arm.6. What care will Steve receive when he is able to return home? Who will care for him?Steve lived alone at the time he suffered his stroke. After he is discharged from the inpatient rehabilitation center, Steve will move to his brother Collin Parker’s house. Steve will still require ongoing occupational, physical, and speech therapy as well as the assistance of a home health aide to perform self-care and home management activities. Collin and his wife will help Steve while attending to their young family and professional obligations.Read more"

She was riding in a designated bike lane wearing her helmet when a city garbage truck struck her. She sustained a closed head injury, a punctured lung, compound fractures of her tibia and fibula of the lower right leg with soft tissue damage, fractures to her pelvis, 8 broken ribs on the left side, 2 fractured vertebrae, as well as a perforated spleen. She remains in Bay Front Health Hospital in St. Petersburg, FL. She has gone from the ER to ICU, to the Trauma unit, and is now in their Rehabilitation unit. During this time, she has not been able to have any visitors due to Covid-19.Because of the fractures in her pelvis and leg, Julie is unable to put any weight on either leg, so she is, and will be, wheelchair bound for at least three (3) months. Thankfully, every day that goes by, Julie's family sees improvement. However, Julie will need months of rehab when she is able to put weight on her legs again. As you can well imagine, Julie’s medical costs will be exorbitant and her family needs your help.Julie is married and has two (step) sons, 23 and 25, that she has raised and is very proud of. Julie has focused her career on fish and wildlife conservation. She works for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Washington D.C. as their lead for national conservation planning and policy for the National Wildlife Refuge System. She has lived in D.C. for 4 1/2 years, but travels across the United States to learn and understand the variety of issues that she can represent in the nation's capital. She enjoys being outside fishing and hunting and seeing wildlife in their native habitats. That is what attracted her to travel to Florida to vacation. She was in Florida to pursue her love for kayaking, fishing, cycling and, of course, obtain some beach time.It's an extremely trying time for us all, but we need to remember - we are still in this together. For some of us, many years may have passed since we last met or spoke (Auburn High School Class of '94, I'm talking to you), but we cannot forget that when one of us is in need, WE respond. We all have families, stories, and experiences which have taken us into our current lives, (beyond high school), but let us not forget our happy days , when we supported and cared for one another. On behalf of Julie Henning and her family, we ask that you continue to support her in her need and help in her recovery. We ask that you donate generously.Read more"

I'm a 40 year old bartender with a love for playing all things music. I was approached by a journalist from Time Magazine( link to the articlehttps://time.com/5940505/housing-crisis-2021/ ) in December, that was writing a story on the rent crisis our country’s currently experiencing and the issues that tenants and landlords are going through. Some of you reading this may have found me through that or you might know me in “real life”.As so many of us, I’ve been out of work on furlough from my bar manager position(I’ve been a volunteer at a non-profit club for 12+yrs) since early March, 2020, and because I was a volunteer, I haven't qualified for any unemployment assistance through this whole quarantine/pandemic. I now owe over $25,000 in back rent and more to other bills and personal loans. The little savings I had has long since been cleaned out and as I'm typing this I have less than $20 dollars in my bank account. I’ve never had much money, never had credit cards, and I don’t have any investments. But I’ve never NOT BEEN ABLE TO WORK when I needed to pay my bills. I’m a musician, an artist, and I believe in working, earning your keep.Imagine you’re at the grocery store, in the milk aisle Have you ever wondered if you really NEED the gallon of milk in your grocery cart? I hesitantly put it back onto the shelf because i figured the loaf of bread would go further and I could make more things to feed my girlfriend and myself with it. These are now common thoughts I have when shopping at the store. In the past year, it’s become a decision I have to make every time. And more times than i can count I simply didn't have the money for even the loaf of bread, let alone anything to put on it. The choice between bread or milk, food or gas.So by June I tried driving for DoorDash. That seemed like it would be a great help. I could just drop off food deliveries until clubs could open again!I’m driving for Door Dash for about a month and one evening I’m on an order. I make sure the bag holding the thai food is safely strapped into my passenger seat and as I started to drive across the parking lot.....BAM! The car from halfway across the parking lot was suddenly hitting me, knocking my car up a curb. He was driving about 30mph! So I get out and inspect the damage. The back left drivers-side tire was bent inward, looking like the axle might've been snapped. That was the moment that all of the anxiety, stress, and just plain fear of the last year hit me. The realization that the only thing keeping my girlfriend, kitty, and I from starving. The one thing putting money into my empty bank account. The one glimmer of hope that i might be able to earn money to pay my landlord ANYTHING towards rent or for the stacked electricity, heat, or water bills.. was GONE. It was gone and with it and my hope that we could somehow find a way out of this hell the pandemic had put us in.My car was totaled by an uninsured driver and I had nothing to pull from to fix it. And by October we were looking at becoming homeless without even a car to live in.I've always believed in working for what you want and always had a hard time asking for help, even when I should. Five years ago, I had a brush with death. I spent three months in a coma while machines breathed for me. My lungs, kidneys, and liver all failed due to a case of necrotizing pancreatitis. I also acquired a rare condition while in the coma that caused my elbows and knees to lose the majority of their range of motion. It was the most painful, impossibly scary thing I’ve ever gone through. When I woke up, I couldn’t even hold a pen to sign my name. I was told that I’d be insulin dependent and have trouble walking for the rest of my life, after I re-learned how to walk again. But after almost a year of painful physical rehabilitation, numerous surgeries, and the love and support of my amazing girlfriend, family, and friends, It left me with a few lasting health issues but I lived through it. But now the tables have turned. Now it is my girlfriend that has a degenerating condition in her hips that is preventing her from being able to walk. Which has basically made me her primary caregiver during this pandemic. She is almost entirely reliant on me.I’ve never been good at recognizing when it’s time to ask my friends and family for some support and now I’m so far behind in debt, with the ever looming possibility of becoming homeless, I don’t know what to do. Writing this GOFundMe is so hard, hard because I feel like I’ve failed. Failed my girlfriend, my kitty, and failed myself.Thank you for taking the time to read my story. And while I’m thanking, a huge thanks to Abby Vesoulis, the Time journalist that wrote the story & our absolutely AMAZING landlord for being beyond understanding, patient, and caring. I know everyone’s going through an undefinably hard time right now. But if you can help us out with any amount, I can’t tell you how much it would help, what it would mean to us. And if you can’t give, if you could share it on your Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc, we would be forever grateful.Thank you from the bottom of my heart,Ollie AldamaRead more"

He had an awake craniotomy and tumour resection but had a post operative brain haemorrhage the following day. The surgery resulted in an acquired brain injury of the frontal lobe which has required ongoing rehabilitation and support. He is unable to work or drive. He had 6 weeks of radiation treatment and 12 months of chemotherapy. My Mum has been doing everything possible to support him and keep our family going. They have been together since they were teenagers and married for 22 years this year. They have had their ups and downs but always managed to keep it all together. Dad has frontal lobe brain damage so is nothing like he was before the operation. He needs a lot of support to have a decent quality of life. When Dad got sick I was 16 and my siblings Sam and Lucy were 9 and 7. Mum has never asked for any financial support but has worked and budgeted to try and keep our family comfortable as well as managing Dad's disability.On April 14 2020 my Mum Louise, who is 45, had 6 seizures in one day. She was diagnosed with a brain tumour following an MRI. It was totally unexpected as she was healthy and working and showing no symptoms. We were all shocked and devastated. She is currently waiting for a date to have surgery. She is now unable to work or drive. This has put a financial and emotional strain on our family. Only 2 weeks before she had suddenly lost her Mum and our Granny when she died of a pulmonary embolism. Everything seems so unfair and I don't know why this had to happen to us.As Dad is unable to care for Mum and support our family we plan to move in with my Mum's Dad. His house requires modification to make it multi generational and safe for my Dad who has mobility problems and both my parents who now have epilepsy. I am hoping to raise some money to help pay for this and to ease our financial stress as it is a huge strain on an already stressful situation. We would like to get this done as soon as possible so my Poppy can take care of Mum after her operation.My Mum has always told us how blessed we are and how things could be worse and to be positive and hopeful but it's really hard sometimes.I hope that there is someone out there who can afford to help us but I realise that this is a big ask. Mum never wanted to ask for help. I want things to be easier for them and my younger brother and sister.We would appreciate your support but understand that everyone is strained at the moment.

We paid the shelter to ship her from Beijing to New York. She’s had a tough life, including an attack by a man that left her with only 1 eye. We’re happy to give her a better life but she’s incredibly traumatized and scared of humans. We’ve been patiently trying to rehabilitate her over the last few months with little progress. We’ve already spent a fortune on behaviorists, but they’re unable to help and told us that we need to hire a specialized behaviorist, which will cost $1,800.Long version (grab your tissues, light a candle):Like many others at the start of the pandemic in 2020, my boyfriend and I adopted a shelter dog. What we knew was that we’d be giving a dog in need a new lease on life. What we didn’t realize was the long and difficult road ahead to her recovery and rehabilitation.Willa, a 17 lb, 5 yr old, one-eyed mixed breed dog, was officially adopted from a shelter in Beijing at the end of March 2020. We were told that she was fearful and it would take a big heart and a lot of patience, but the shelter was positive she would thrive in the right environment. She had been rescued from the China dog meat trade. Her right eye had been horrifically damaged, but the shelter was able to operate on her and save her. She lost use of that eye, but other than that and her fear of some humans, was in good physical health.Unfortunately, due to Beijing’s Covid restrictions, we didn’t receive her until the day after Thanksgiving. Until that point, we had received a few videos and photos of Willa. She seemed generally fine - in some videos, she is seen happily trotting about. She doesn’t engage with other dogs, but she doesn’t appear afraid of them. In other videos, she is with her handler. She is wary of him, but she seems to tolerate him. She appears to not like being petted. Sometimes if someone gets too close, she’ll squeeze herself into a corner or lower her body to the ground, trying to make herself very small. We felt the handler was too aggressive, too loud, too MUCH and we would be very different.We studied these videos. We knew we had a lot to work with, but we were certain in a few weeks she’d be loving her new home and cuddling up to us. We watched countless videos on The Dodo, of amazing humans rescuing dog after dog, and the dogs adapting and thriving within a few weeks. We looked with eager anticipation for the day when we would finally welcome Willa into our home, and felt that in no time she’d know that she was a part of our family. We were too optimistic.Today is Day 73, Week 11. 11 weeks is not a long time in the grand scheme of things, and she is very slowly progressing, but she will need a lot more time and training. Every shelter dog’s journey is different and we understand that, but it is starting to get very expensive to rehabilitate her.We have already had 2 behaviorists, tried different types of CBD and calming chews like Solliquin and Zylkene, and used Adaptil sprays to no avail.We need to get her on behavior medication, but we’re unable to get her to a vet because she darts away if we go anywhere near her. We can’t just grab her - it would set her back too much. Since we can’t get to her, we also can’t walk her so she goes on pee pads in the apartment. We have attempted to gently leash her many, many times. Each time, she runs away and trembles in fear. She has shown that she is a submissive eliminator and very easily gets stressed out and eliminates.Her nails have become a detriment - they are so long that they are curling under, and must be hurting her. She won’t come out on the hardwood after slipping one time in Week 7 (due to hair growing between her paws), so we have bought a bunch of new rugs and mats to place everywhere, but she generally does not come out of her bed now except to eat and eliminate.We have agreed that she won’t ever be a lap dog, and we will never force her to be, but we’d like to get her on behavior medication somehow and the behavior training will have to continue. We will not give up on little Willa, Willy Wonka, our One-Eyed Princess. We want to give her the best life but we need a little help.The next step is to get her to a Vet Behaviorist. These are limited in the country, and cost $900 for a mandatory 2 part session, but they will be able to observe her and prescribe her the proper medication. We’d like to get her at least 2 appointments for what would total $1,800. For more info you can visit www.nycvetbehavior.com.Thank you for reading and please pray for Willa!Read more"

Her story began in 2015 with what she thought was something in her heel. After going to the foot doctor she was told she had a collapsed arch that would need a simple surgery.The doctor over operated leaving Cristyl with nerve damage and chronic pain. This has left Cristyl whom was once a busy, energetic, active mother of 2 (Hoyt 11 and Karlie Jo 9) wife to Josh Choate and Business owner most times bed ridden. No longer able to run her business herself, care for her children or maintain her home fully as she once did, Josh and Cristyl have tried and are willing to try any treatment available to manage pain and restore Cristyl's life even if a little bit. Through it all Cristyl still continues to keep a smile on her face.Over the last 5 ½ years Cristyl has had over 100 procedures and therapies as well as 35 back surgeries (spinal cord stimulator) and 3 failed pain pumps, the first one that caused an infection that almost killed her, causing each one after needing to be removed as well due to internal infections from the first.Her children have had to grow up quickly. They have learned at their young ages how to administer both oral medications and infusion medications as Cristyl was unable to do them for herself and Josh HAS to keep working to support the family, and maintain insurance benefits.The last attempt at pain management was a spinal stimulator in November that caused excessive bleeding. This leaves Cristyl once again only able to use very strong medication to help her try to cope with the pain.Both Josh and Cristyl continue to research any new treatments that might help. Through research they have found the Spero Clinic in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The Spero Clinic's mission is to help those who have lost hope to reclaim their lives. While the Spero Clinic does not claim to treat or cure any specific condition they do aim to restore balance to the Central Nervous System, which assists the body in healing from within. They are currently the only center in the world that offers a unique neurologic rehabilitation.At this point Josh and Cristyl are clinging to hope that this will be the answer while trying to stay positive. This facility as with everything else comes at a cost, and this one is not covered by insurance. The last thing they wanted to do was to ask for help however as their sister I am asking for the help. The total cost is going to be $100,000.00. I am asking for any assistance anyone can give. Every cent is greatly appreciated. Prayers too!This journey has been so difficult on the entire family. I have also set up a mailbox as well if anyone would like to send a note of encouragement to Cristyl and her family. The address is 472 N Route 47 Suite F PMB 253 Sugar Grove, IL 60554.Read more"

Hi everyone, my name is Nicole. At 22 years old my little brother Bradley has been diagnosed with an aggressive form a Sarcoma Cancer in his foot. Unfortunately, by the time we caught it, the tumour had basically consumed his entire foot, destroying all the bones and leaving his foot unsalvageable. Additionally, this type of cancer does not respond well to Chemo or radiation, leaving Brad with only one option, amputation from the knee down.

All this information within just a short few weeks has been devastating to our family. But we are fighting together and staying optimistic that things will start looking up for Brad soon.

---------------------------------------------------

Brad's story:It was 2020 and it was an exciting year because I was just finishing up my third year of university. But in March my final third year semester took a terrible turn. Due to the coronavirus I was forced to finish my semester online but not only that, I had a terrible pain and swelling in my left ankle/foot.I had visited my school clinic and then later the hospital with both telling me that I had a sprained ankle even with an x ray.Eventually the pain had gotten so bad that I went to the hospital again where I had stayed in the ER for 24 hours doing tests. I was later admitted to the hospital where I had even more tests done including a biopsy.One week later I received the results that completely rocked my world. I was told I had cancer, but they just weren’t sure what kind.I left Ottawa and went home to tell my entire family and all my friends. They were devastated. I was devastated. I couldn’t believe that this was happening to me. A week later I went to Toronto where an even larger biopsy was performed. They told me they would absolutely know what it was after that.3 weeks later I went it and they still didn’t know. They had an idea that it was a sarcoma called Cic Dux4. At this point my foot was so large. They had measured a tumour inside that was larger than 6cm. The pain was unbearable. I stayed up most nights rolling around and screaming.One night I decided to look up this Cic Dux4. The only thing I wanted to know was the prognosis. I typed in Cic Dux4 survival rate and that’s when I saw... 28.2%. I broke down. I couldn’t believe it. I cried for the rest of night from the pain of my foot and pain in knowing that I was probably going to die.That’s when my family and my doctor decided that the only alternative would be amputation. This was all happening so fast it felt like a dream. Nothing seemed real anymore. In February I had my entire life ahead of me, everything was going great. I was happy. I had jobs lined up for the summer and I had goals lined up for my life and I was going to achieve them too, I knew it. Then just 5 months later I felt as though I had nothing in my life. But I didn’t want to give up. I couldn’t give up just like that. So that’s why I agreed to the amputation. My last hope. And I’m still going to achieve all my goals regardless because that’s what I was born to do. And I need a good prosthetic leg to do it. ---------------------------------------------------

Brad was always the athletic one in our family and continues to live a very active lifestyle. He plays baseball and hockey, runs, and goes camping and hiking. The loss of a foot is not something that any 22 year old should have to endure. We hope to get Brad a prosthesis which will allow him to go back to living a normal life and complete university on time with his peers.Brad’s amputation will be performed in a week, afterwards he will be fitted for his prosthesis. We are very grateful for the urgency the doctors have given to Brad’s treatment. However this gives us very little time to figure out finances.A prosthetic leg will cost between $10,000 and $50,000, only part of which will be covered by insurance. Additionally Brad will require months of rehabilitation in Toronto. Money and bills are the last thing we want Brad to be concerned about right now. The purpose of this gofundme page is to help lessen the financial burden for Brad during this difficult time.Thank you to all our family and friends. We appreciate all the prayers and kind words. I will continue to update this page regularly.---------------------------------------------------A message from our mom, Wendy:A mother’s worst nightmare ... is it a child’s death or watching her child struggle towards possible death as some unknown cancer ravages their body? Without any way to take away the pain, calm the fear, or offer possible explanation, this has been my reality for the past 7 weeks - an emotional and physical rollercoaster for the entire family.After countless medical procedures (both invasive and non-invasive), visits to 5 different hospitals and at least as many doctors (some considered genius in the area of malignant sarcomas) we are no closer to finding a definitive diagnosis, as this cancer has baffled brilliant doctors and their colleagues, offering only a guess at a possible diagnosis, leaving Brad with no definitive cure or idea of outcome.Can you imagine his fear? Can you imagine sitting by his side, doing nothing but waiting … for the phone calls from the doctor that never come, the results of tests that never calm, the sleepless nights that bring no rest, the miracles from heaven we still pray for...To hear your child ask the doctor “am I going to die?” is something I hope you never have to experience. I can assure you it is utterly heart-breaking.We have been overwhelmed by the love, support and many beautiful gestures you our family and friends have sent our way and appreciate every kind thought and prayer you offer us. … please help us afford Brad the opportunity to live his life as fully as he has always dreamed.Thanking you from the bottom of my heart,Wendy Bishop

It's amazing to watch the tiny helpless kits grow up and become young foxes. Towards the end of October the old man with a distinctive spotted nose was severely injured and lost the use of his front left leg. This old fox already affected by past injuries whose approximately 10-12 years old would have a difficult time hunting but this new injury would make it virtually impossible to hunt and he would most probably would eventually starve to death. I realize that not every injured and sick animal in Algonquin Park can be helped but these foxes and in particular this guy is special to many , myself included.  Aspen Valley Wildlife Sanctuary was contacted and with the permission of Algonquin Park and the MNRF they were allowed to set up live traps to try and capture and give him medical care to fix his injuries so that he may live out his life naturally . This ended up being a long process, representatives from Aspen Valley travelled many miles to check and re-bait the traps daily. Finally after about a month the old man fox was captured and sent back to their facility for assessment. The actual cost for capturing, medical treatment and rehabilitation is much higher then the goal set for this fundraiser. Four thousand kilometres of travel was incurred by Aspen Valley and the time and fuel expenses are $3500. Medical expenses, rehabilitation and ongoing care will be in the thousand's of dollars.

As a result of a major accident, Alex has sustained serious injury to his spinal cord, leaving him paralysed from the chest down, along with other complications that come with paralysis.On Tuesday 16th June 2020 my fiancé, Alex Collins, who is just 21 years old, dived into a river and hit his head. At the time it was unclear exactly what injuries Alex had sustained, but he couldn’t move his body at all, so we knew it was serious.Alex was very quickly taken to the emergency department at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, where he had an emergency MRI and CT scan. These revealed the extent of his injury and specifically that his C5 vertebra in his neck had split down the middle and was exerting pressure on his spinal cord. We were told Alex would need major and extensive surgery to help relieve this pressure and that the future was fairly unknown.He went down to surgery the next morning and the incredible team of Neurosurgeons replaced his C5 vertebra with a bone graft from his hip. They then bolted his C4, C5 and C6 vertebrae together. Devastatingly, the surgery revealed the severity of the damage to his spinal cord and at the moment he is a Quadriplegic - meaning all four limbs are affected to some extent and the level of recovery is, at this stage, unknown.The following two weeks saw Alex in the Intensive Care Unit, where further procedures, scans and medication were all used to control his situation and, ultimately, help him to remain in a stable condition.Alex is now out of Intensive Care and after 2 weeks on the Neurological Rehabilitation ward in Addenbrooke’s, he has been moved to the spinal rehabilitation unit at Stoke Mandeville hospital where he is receiving amazing care and is at the very start of what will, inevitably, be an extremely long, and complex, journey towards rehabilitation.It will be several months before Alex can return home, and even then we are unsure of the adaptions that will be needed, wherever we will be living.His rehabilitation is going to be incredibly difficult, but is a journey that he will not be going through alone. The mental and physical challenge this will be for Alex means it is so important that we are able to be together. This is, inevitably, going to put massive financial strain on us. There will be a big loss of earnings, lots of travel costs and, potentially, accommodation costs whilst Alex is at the Spinal Unit. This is all before we even begin to think about the huge costs of items and services Alex will need in the future. I am sure many, if not all, will agree when I say that Alex is the kindest, most selfless person I have ever met and is known, by everyone, for his incredibly kind and generous heart. He will always help others before even questioning how it might affect him. Alex is extremely hardworking and will never give up on anything until the job is done. We are so very sure this will play a massive part in his recovery. Alex was working professionally as a dancer / singer before his accident and has always loved performing; we know it is going to be a difficult adjustment for him not being able to do this anymore. He has a love for so many other activities and had recently been doing lots of woodworking and making different contraptions for people. Anyone who knows Alex will know how devastating it will be for him not to be able to do the things he loves most in the world.I would like to thank everyone for the massive amount of support, care and well wishes given to Alex and I over this last month. It has now come to a point where I would like to ask for your help in supporting Alex’s recovery, in future care and for the things he will need moving forward. We have tried to consider as many things that will help him and after many conversations it’s become quite clear that the costs are going to be enormous. We have a target of £50,000, which we know is a massive amount of money but we really hope that people will get involved and even enjoy organising fundraising events to help get Alex back on his feet. The money we hope to raise will be used to help adapt housing where necessary and fund a wheelchair (these are surprisingly expensive), which will be a necessity for Alex. Other costs will be in rehabilitation to try and help him regain as much independence as possible.I know Alex would be the first person campaigning, fundraising and doing anything he could to help and support anyone so I really do hope that you are able to help him in whatever capacity you are able. However big or small, any help will make this unimaginable journey a little less difficult.Thank you all for taking the time to read Alex’s story so far.

Hello all,I’m Anthony, Natacha’s husband and this is her unfortunate story.It’s been a week since the incredible accident that reverberated through the community. Natacha Legein, a Smithfield RI mother of three little ones, 10, 4 and 2 was excited about the opportunity to join the vibrant Pawtuxet Village neighborhood in Cranston RI where she and her husband were scheduled to open their coffee shop on Tuesday 9/22. That’s going to have to wait because on Monday 9/21, at approximately 9pm Natacha was viciously struck by a speeding car seconds after she exited a local store, on her way to finish prepping for her own store’s opening the next morning. Natacha accident video in Cranston RI

On that fateful night Natacha became the innocent victim when one of two speeding cars lost control, careened off the road, and struck Natacha as she walked on the sidewalk to get to her car. Unconscious, Natacha was transported to a local hospital trauma center.Natacha’s accident left her with multiple upper body fractures including a crack in the base of her skull, a fractured vertebra in her neck, broken ribs, a cracked eye socket, a fractured sternum and a bruised lung amongst other injuries. She has extreme difficulty breathing, little to no mobility on her right side and has struggled with considerable brain swelling...but she’s alive! And her friends and family are blessed to be able to say that.Natacha is strong and will pull through, this is just one more difficult hurdle that she’ll deal with and hopefully overcome.The family is expecting significant medical expenses, especially during the long rehabilitation and recovery period that is ahead (optimistic medical estimates are 8-10 weeks before Natacha can get on her feet and have sufficient use of her extremities) Natacha has been a presence in the community, trying to support local causes and to positively impact the people she meets...our humble ask is that we are able to get some support in this incredibly difficult time.Thank you so much.

Hier kan hij een Epic Treatment volgen, waardoor zijn spraakvermogen weer op gang zou kunnen komen.De oorzaak voor het verdwijnen van zijn spraakvermogen is een ongeluk op 25 juni 2019.Jochem, een sociale en welbespraakte jongen, gaat na een lange dag werken en studeren zwemmen met vrienden. Tijdens een stoeipartij van twee van die vrienden, op de steiger van het atol bij Fika, valt één van hen in het water. Bovenop Jochems nek en hoofd. Door deze klap scheurde een van zijn linker halsslagaders. Het grijze deel hieronder is het afgestorven stuk. Dat was niet meteen duidelijk, maar de pijn zorgde er voor dat Jochem stopte met zwemmen en naar huis ging. Hij ging die avond gewoon naar bed, maar kon niet slapen van de pijn. Spierpijn, dacht Jochem. Met spierzalf heeft hij geprobeerd de pijn te verzachten.De volgende ochtend, tussen 10.00 en 10.15, werd Jochem op school onwel. Na telefonisch contact met zijn moeder, een half uur later, werd op haar aandringen een ambulance gebeld. Ondanks de verstrekte informatie dat er de avond ervoor iemand op zijn hoofd/ nek was gevallen tijdens het zwemmen, werd daar niets mee gedaan.De ambulancemedewerkers hebben een monitor aangesloten om allerlei lichaamswaarden bij Jochem te meten, maar gaan helemaal voorbij aan het bekende 'Mond Spraak Arm'. Men gaat er van uit dat het lichaam in acute stress modus is geschoten, omdat er ook verteld is hoe hard Jochem vanaf die maandagavond heeft gewerkt om over te gaan. Dat verhaal van het ambulancepersoneel leek aannemelijk, ondanks dat Jochem nooit last van stress leek te hebben. Ze hebben echter niet aan een herseninfarct gedacht, wat dus ook bij een 16 jarige jongen kan optreden. Dit gebeurd in Nederland dan ook tussen de 400 á 500 keer per jaar bij jongeren onder de 35.Nadat zijn beide ouders op school zijn, mochten ze Jochem mee naar huis nemen om hem de stress ‘uit te laten slapen’. Hij zou die slaap nodig hebben en daarna wel weer snel 'de oude zijn'. Opmerkelijk is het vertrek van de ambulance, omdat Jochem nog steeds niet aanspreekbaar is of in staat is om iets te drinken. De ouders vertrekken met Jochem naar huis, om hem te laten slapen en arriveren rond 13:00 uur thuis, waar ze hem op de bank leggen. Hij is nog steeds niet aanspreekbaar en werkt niet mee met zijn vervoer. Omdat ze denken dat dit bij het beeld hoort dat door de ambulance geschetst is, bedenken ze nog niet dat er iets ernstigers aan de hand is. Vier uur later is er geen enkele verandering in het beeld is opgetreden en is Jochem nog steeds niet aanspreekbaar, of in staat om iets te drinken. Ze bellen zelf nogmaals 112 voor advies. Direct komt er een tweede ambulance, die na een snelle controle met hoge spoed naar het Isala Ziekenhuis Zwolle rijdt (nota bene 10 minuten bij zijn school vandaan). Hier is pas 's avonds, middels een scan, een herseninfarct geconstateerd.Door een scheurtje in zijn linker halsslagader is een bloedprop ontstaan, waardoor deze ader dichtgeslibd is. Een propje is vanuit daar in zijn hersenen terecht gekomen, waardoor hij in de klas omviel. Omdat het in eerste instantie op stress gegooid werd, zijn de eerste cruciale uren voorbij gegaan zijn, zonder de nodige medische hulp.‘s Avonds om 19:00 werd Jochem naar de OK gebracht, waar artsen het propje in zijn hersenen hebben kunnen verwijderen. Vervolgens kreeg Jochem bloedverdunners toegediend om eventuele andere bloedstolsels te bestrijden. Vanaf dat moment is hij rechtszijdig verlamd en heeft zijn spraak verloren. Welke schade er nog meer ontstaan is, is dan nog niet duidelijk, maar het ergste wordt gevreesd. Hij zou niet meer kunnen lopen, mogelijk blind zijn en nooit meer de ‘oude worden’. Er zal nog een hele lange weg van revalidatie te gaan zijn.Na een eerste revalidatieperiode in Hilversum, waar Jochem snel terecht kon, komt hij uiteindelijk terecht in het Daan Theeuwes Centrum in Woerden. Daar zal hij door de intensieve therapie lichamelijk snel revalideren, lopen en zelfs rennen en sporten. Hier werd al niet meer vanuit gegaan door het enorme tijdverlies.Helaas kan Jochem nog steeds niet goed praten. Hij heeft forse afasie aan het infarct overgehouden (a = niet, fasie=praten). Voor zo’n jonge knul, die altijd zo wel bespraakt was en met zijn grappen en verhalen zo eenvoudig een goede sfeer wist te creëren voor zijn omgeving, is dat een extra hard gelach.Waarom deze actie?Deze week is er een intakegesprek geweest met een van de behandelende artsen om de mogelijkheden van Jochem te bespreken. Het zal een spannend traject worden, want Jochem heeft niet ‘zomaar een hersenschudding’, die behandeld moet worden en garanties zijn er niet.Wij willen er als zijn ouders alles aan doen om Jochem de kans te geven om weer goed te gaan praten. Daarom willen we met Jochem naar CognitiveFX in Utah (VS) om een therapie te krijgen. De zogenoemde EPIC Treatment: een therapie waar revalidanten veel vooruitgang ervaren. Ook revalidanten uit Nederland, die hun positieve ervaringen bij Eva Jinek op tv deelden. Een erg kostbare behandeling, waarvoor we deze crowdfunding starten!

Alle beetjes helpen!Doneren kan via deze site https://www.gofundme.com/f/jochem-naar-utahOn June 26th 2019, 4 days before his 17th birthday our son was struck by a cerebral infarction while he was at school. The evening before a friend fell on his head while he was swimming in the nearby lake. Without anyone imagining it, a tear had developed in his carotid artery, causing a clot of clotted blood to shoot up hours later. A part of his brain died. Time stood still.Our social, eloquent, hardworking and sporty son, became paralyzed right-sided and lost his speech from that moment on. It became very quiet.The staff at school and the called ambulance did not treat him the way they should have and send him home, after diagnosing his symptoms as 'stress related'. He was taken to the hospital hours later, by a second ambulance, where the diagnosis was made. Diagnosis were that he may be (color) blind, would never walk again and remain paralyzed on the right. Jochem would show that he would not recover according to statistics ...As you can see in the video, Jochem has progressed very much physically, due to the intensive therapy in the Daan Theeuwes rehabilitation Center in Woerden. Unfortunately, Jochem still cannot speak well. He has suffered severe aphasia from the cerebral infarction.As his parents we want to do everything we can to give Jochem the opportunity to start talking again. That is why we want to go to CognitiveFX in Utah (USA) with Jochem to receive therapy. A therapy where clients experience a lot of progress. A very expensive treatment, for which we start this crowdfunding! Could you miss a contribution to get Jochem to Utah? Every little bit helps!

If not---the short story is that my husband (Jeff) and son (Judge) came within an inch of their lives when they were crushed by a 75 foot red oak tree that fell during a storm in Nashville. Three year old Judge suffered a severe traumatic brain injury and was in a coma for two weeks, all the while being closely and carefully monitored by the heroes at Monroe Carroll, Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt. Because neither our hometown of Nashville, nor the State of Tennessee offers inpatient rehabilitation for children with brain injuries, Vanderbilt transferred Judge to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA), where we have been since May 27th. Jeff shattered 19 ribs, both of his scapulas, punctured a lung, and grotesquely broke his back (sorry, but that's how it was described to us), requiring spinal surgery to both fuse his broken vertebrae and to insert a steel rod. It's nothing short of a miracle that both survived their injuries, and in Jeff's case, is able to use his legs. Because of the global pandemic, cruelly, neither Jeff nor Judge have been allowed visitors during their hospital stays. I've been living with Judge and, mercifully, both hospitals have made a couple of exceptions along the way, so that Jeff could see Judge and I for a short time...but our family having to be apart over the last six weeks with no other visitors has been very tough for us to endure emotionally. Thankfully, Jeff has since moved on to outpatient status and is doing his rehabilitation work at the renowned Shepherd Center in Atlanta, while staying in an apartment nearby the facility. We're incredibly grateful that both Jeff and Judge were able to transfer to two of the top facilities in the country to undergo their rehab work. Once Judge is discharged from CHOA and is ready to begin his outpatient work, we have rented a home where the three of us will finally reunite as a family. What a happy day that will be! Jeff & Judge's doctors have been straight-forward in stressing the long-term therapy and care both will require. We don't know yet how Judge's young brain will heal but doctors have warned us that he may have life-long complications from the severity of his injuries. But we pray for a complete healing everyday, and we are certain that our family (extended to include you) is still living through an active, fluid, and dynamic miracle, that our precious Judge will recover fully, and will live a full and rich life, forever to be known as the boy that took on a majestic red oak, and lived to tell about it!In the few moments Jeff and I have been afforded alone, we've begun to get an understanding of the fallout from this tragedy, both in terms of financial expenses and disruption to our professional lives. We're absorbing the sobering reality that the cost of this unexpected event outstretches the resources we have available. This has been a humbling exercise, and one that has required us to face our hubris, and drop our pride for the good of our family, especially for Judge. We're heeding the advice given by our brother Thad Cockrell from one of his most inspired songs; ""Pride won't get us where we're going"". Where we're going is home, in every sense of that word...and we need your help in getting there. It takes all the courage we can muster to ask for your assistance, even while knowing that many of you have already offered and many more are willing. It's overwhelming to consider the encouragement, love and support we've already received, and we're awestruck by the grace and generosity provided us daily, both in ways we see, and in ways unseen but felt. Please know that once we're to the other side of this, a ""Healthy Family Together Again"", and back on firm footing, both physically and financially, we'll repay the charity given us to the life-saving, care-giving, soul-enriching healthcare providers who have nurtured Judge back to good heath, sound mind and strong spirit. We'll forever think of you as we support Monroe Carroll, Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, as well as CHOA. Your gifts will be paid forward, but our family will be forever indebted to the angels who, we believe, appeared to us even as that tree began to fall, and will stay with us for time eternity.Read more"

But, she remained in the hospital for almost a month because of severe complications. After a great deal of testing she was diagnosed with Paraneoplastic Syndrome from Ovarian Dermoid Cysts. She is also suffering from Cerebellar Ataxia, which attacks the cerebellum and causes excessive shaking, slurred speech, difficulty writing/reading and she now requires the use of a wheelchair as she cannot walk without assistance. I understand that this may be difficult to hear because when many of you think of Malika, you immediately think of a strong, resilient, independent and articulate woman. For those who have met and/or worked with her she has surely been a light, a counselor, a beautiful spirit, a generous collaborator, a sister, and an amazing friend.She is still all of those things, but in full truth, she is also a woman up against some very real obstacles. She is in the fight of her life, and she needs our help.Her doctors have given her a prognosis and implemented treatment which combines medication with intensive physical rehabilitation; a healing process that will take time, as a theater director and freelance artist, she will not be working for the next few months.Also, like many free-lance artists and millions more in this country, she is on Medicaid- which cannot cover the full cost of this recovery.To help Malika focus on her healing, and to remove the additional stress of financial struggles, her family and friends are starting a GoFundMe Fundraiser.These funds will be used to assist her receive a higher quality of treatment, as well as cover copays for medical care, household bills, and transportation costs to-and-from rehab.We are hoping to raise $15,000.If you are willing and able to give, it would be greatly appreciated as a tangible way to help her in what is going to be a struggle for her in every way.

UPDATE 02.08.20, 18:10An important figure in the sport of mountain biking needs our help (english below).#WeWillHelpErhardGollerWir sind FreundInnen von Erhard Goller und sammeln Geld für seine Sprachtherapie. Am 14. Juni erlitt Erhard einen Schlaganfall und eine Hirnblutung. Nach einer Woche auf der Intensivstation stand fest, dass er eine starke Aphasie erlitten hat. Das bedeutet, dass sein Sprachzentrum im Gehirn stark geschädigt ist: Er kann sich weder artikulieren noch Texte lesen, während er sonst, geistig wie körperlich, vollkommen fit ist.Das ist – besonders für einen Journalisten – das worst-case-Szenario. Momentan befindet sich Erhard in der BDH-Rehaklinik Elzach. Seit einer Woche gelingt es ihm, einzelne Worte zu sagen. Diese Reha-Klinik wird noch bis zum 14. August von der Krankenkasse übernommen. Doch eine weiterführende Therapie ist unabdingbar für Erhards weitere Genesung. Was er braucht, laut den behandelnden Ärzten, ist eine Spezialtherapie, mit der er Schritt für Schritt wieder lernt, Buchstaben mit Sinn zu füllen und richtig zu verwenden. Denn er muss das Sprechen, das Lesen und Schreiben komplett neu lernen. Diese Therapie in einer auf Aphasien spezialisierten Reha-Klinik muss - sollte die Krankenkasse nicht weiter unterstützen - privat finanziert werden. Sie sollte mindestens vier Monate dauern und wir müssen mit rund 10.000 Euro Kosten pro Monat rechnen. Favorit ist die Uniklinik Aachen, die eine Aphasiestation haben. Mittlerweile haben wir diese Mindestkosten erreicht - das ist super! Vielen Dank an alle! Damit er solange dort bleiben kann, wie er es benötigt, haben wir das Spendenziel auf 60.000 Euro erhöht.Erhard im Interview mit Irina Kalentieva 2019. F: Weschta.Mit dieser Spendenaktion möchten wir Erhard bei der Finanzierung der Reha helfen und hoffen auf die tatkräftige Unterstützung der Mountainbike-Community. Erhard ist sehr motiviert und gilt in seiner aktuellen Reha-Klinik als Musterpatient.Erhard widmet sich seit 2000 der Mountainbike-Berichterstattung. Als einziger freier Journalist weltweit reiste er zu fast allen nationalen und internationalen Rennen und berichtete vom Renngeschehen. Seine Kunden sind verschiedene Zeitungen, die dpa und der sid, Magazine, Verbände und Profi-Teams. Bei der seltenen Bildschirmpräsenz der Mountainbiker, etwa bei Olympia, versorgte er die KommentatorInnen und JournalistInnen verschiedener Sportredaktionen mit Informationen und Einschätzungen zum Cross-Country und Marathon-Sport.Erhard 2006 beim MTB-Weltcup in Curacao.Trotz diesen vielfältigen Anforderungen berichtete der 56-Jährige auf seinem Blog www.acrossthecountry.net ehrenamtlich und kostenfrei für die LeserInnen über die Geschehnisse auf und neben der Rennstrecke. Dieses Ehrenamt betrieb er genauso ernsthaft und selbstkritisch wie seine hauptberuflichen Tätigkeiten. So schuf er über Jahre eine Öffentlichkeit für den Mountainbike-Sport, die es ohne seine Leidenschaft für den Sport, sein Engagement und Herzblut nicht geben würde. Die Empathie und Zurückhaltung, die Erhard jeder/m entgegen bringt, wird auch von den Sportlerinnen und Sportlern sehr geschätzt.Nino Schurter, Olympiasieger 2016, Achtmaliger Weltmeister: „Erhard Goller ist eine positive Konstante des Mountainbike-Sports. Nur ganz wenige kennen sich so profund aus in unser Sportart. Seine Arbeit weiß ich sehr zu schätzen, nicht nur wegen seines Fachwissens als Journalist. Er war stetig sehr respektvoll uns Fahrern gegenüber. Er wollte immer nur das Beste für uns und den Sport. Und genau das das hat er mit seinem Schaffen auch bewirkt.“Jolanda Neff, Gesamtweltcup-Siegerin 2018, Weltmeisterin 2017: „Es gibt keinen Journalisten, der meine Karriere so genau kennt wie Erhard. Seit 10 Jahren sehe ich ihn bei jedem einzelnen Rennen. Er kennt die Rennszene wie sonst niemand, begegnet jedem Fahrer mit größtem Respekt und wahrt diesen auch in seiner Berichterstattung. Was er für den Mountainbikesport macht ist total unersetzlich – vor allem im deutschsprachigen Raum. Es gibt niemanden, der diesen Einblick und dieses Verständnis hat.“Manuel Fumic, mehrfacher Deutscher Meister: ""Erhard gehört national und international durch seine journalistische Arbeit, aber vor allem durch seine positive menschliche Art, sein Engagement und seinem Herzblut, zum festen Bestandteil der Mountainbike Community. Ich kenne Erhard seit über 20 Jahren und für mich ist er ein guter Freund geworden der meine Karriere von Anfang an mit begleitet hat. Er hat dem Mountainbike Sport sehr viel gegeben, ich hoffe dass wir als MTB Community auch ihm jetzt etwas zurückgeben können und ihm helfen, wieder gesund zu werden.""Gunn-Rita Dahle-Flesja, MTB-Legende: «Erhard did a great job for our sport for sure and I would say he has been the best journalist ever around, getting the good and interesting stories, asking the different questions but never stepping on anyones toes. His smiley face was always a second away and we had many good laugh together during all these years in the same business. Erhard loved the life and all life around him. He did not take a lot of space, more the quiet type, but easy and feel good talking to. I do hope some specialist can help Erhard and get his life back more or less as before. He guess he has many stories still to tell and share with other people»Elisabeth Brandau, Deutsche Meisterin: „Erhard begleitet mich schon meine ganze Karriere und durch seinen Weitblick ist er auch ein guter Freund geworden! Ich hoffe für ihn persönlich, dass er es schafft, wieder zu seiner Stärke zurück zu finden. Ohne ihn wäre unser Sport nicht so publik geworden und ich wünsche mir, dass wir ihm jetzt etwas zurückgeben können, um seine Genesung zu unterstützen!“Beim Weltcup in Lenzerheide 2019. F: Sigel.--------------------------------------------We are friends and colleagues of Erhard Goller’s and are raising money to cover the costs for his speech therapy. On June 14, Erhard suffered a stroke, which caused internal bleeding to his brain. After one week of intensive care, we now know that the stroke has damaged his brain’s language center. While regaining most of his health, he suffers from severe Aphasia, leaving him unable to speak or read texts.For a journalist this is a particularly difficult reality to face. Currently, Erhard is a patient at the BDH Rehabilitation Clinic in Elzach. His health insurance will discontinue covering the costs of his rehabilitation after August 14. His doctors though stress the need for further treatment. But what Erhard really needs, according to the doctors, is a more specialized form of therapy, where, step by step, he is taught how to give meaning to all the letters of the alphabet and use them correctly. He faces the challenge of completely relearning how to speak, read, and write. This highly necessary, long-term therapy, offered only at special clinics for Aphasia patients, is not covered by health insurance. The treatment should last at least four months and we are assuming costs will rise to approximately 10,000 Euros per month. The best amongst such clinics is the University Clinic in Aachen. UPDATE: Thank you to each and everyone, who donated already! We managed to organize the costs for the minimum time of 4 months in the clinic in less than 24 hours! Thats amazing! To make sure, that Erhard can stay as long as he needs and have the best support for his cause, I set the goal to 60.000 euro.With our fund-raising campaign, we want to help Erhard finance his treatment and hope for the active support of the mountain bike community. Erhard is highly motivated and is considered a model patient in his current rehab clinic.Erhard has dedicated himself to reporting on the sport of mountain biking since 2000. He is the only freelance journalist worldwide who has travelled to almost all national and international races and reported on race events. His clients include various newspapers, the dpa and the sid, magazines, associations and professional teams. During the rare on-screen presence of mountain bikers, for example at the Olympics, he provided the commentators and journalists from various sport media outlets with information and assessments on cross-country and marathon sports. Despite these many demands, Erhard still found the time to write about events and stories on and off of the racetrack on his blog www.acrossthecountry.net. He took this role upon himself just as seriously as his full-time activities. Over the years he created publicity for the mountain bike sport that would not have existed without his commitment and passion for the sport. His low-key professionalism and personal warmth are also highly appreciated by the athletes. Nino Schurter, Olympic Champion 2016, eight-time World Champion: ""Erhard Goller has always been a positive and stable presence in mountain biking. Only very few people know our sport so profoundly as he does. I appreciate his work, not only because of his expertise as a journalist. He has also always been very respectful towards us riders. He wanted only the best for us and the sport. And that's exactly what he did with his work.""Jolanda Neff, overall World Cup winner 2018, World Champion 2017: “There is no journalist who knows my career as well as Erhard does. For 10 years I have seen him at every single race. He knows the racing scene like no one else, treats every rider with the greatest respect and maintains this respect in his reporting. What he does for mountain biking is irreplaceable - especially in German-speaking countries. His insight and understanding of the sport and its people are unmatched.”Manuel Fumic, multiple times German Champion: “Erhard is at national as well as at international level a profound part of the community of mountainbiking. This is due to his work as a journalist but also through his positive manner, his engagement and his passion. I know Erhard from 20 years and he became a good friend of mine. He gave a lot to our sport and I now hope, that our community will give him something back as well.”Gunn-Rita Dahle-Flesja, MTB-legend: “Erhard did a great job for our sport for sure and I would say he has been the best journalist ever around, getting the good and interesting stories, asking the different questions but never stepping on anyones toes.

I am guessing he has many stories still to tell and share with other people.”Elisabeth Brandau, German Champion: “Erhard has accompanied me throughout my entire career. As a good friend, I admire his farsightedness as a constant visionary. I hope for him personally that he manages a full recovery. Without him our sport would not have reached the same level of attention in the public eye. Now I hope we can give back to him and support his recovery!”Read more"

My Scouting career began as a tiger cub in the first grade, and over the last ten years, Scouting has taught me so many things. More than anything, it has taught me the twelve points of the Scout Law, values like trustworthiness, courtesy, and kindness, that I will carry with me throughout my adult life. One thing all the points of the Scout Law point toward is helping others instead of just helping ourselves. This is why to achieve the highest rank of Eagle Scout, all scouts must plan, organize, and carry out an Eagle Service Project for the betterment of their community. My Eagle Project will be a landscaping improvement project in front of the main administration building of the Veterans Administration in West Los Angeles, California. The VA supports our nation's veterans every day of the year, providing health care, vocational rehabilitation, education assistance, and many other badly needed services for our vets. And yet, the grounds these vets visit are not always the most welcoming. My project will beautify the grounds around the main administration building, making it a more welcome place for veterans to come to when they need help. In addition to cleaning up the area, we will be planting drought-resistant flowering plants to provide a welcoming, peaceful place for our vets to come. I hope you might consider helping me out on this project, by making a donation of any amount. Truly, anything you could give will go a long way toward making this project a reality. Along with the help of my troop and the community, this project will take place on July 6th and 7th, 2019 . Completing this project is not an end to my scouting career, but a test in which I will use the skills that I have learned throughout my years of Scouting to provide leadership and guidance to my fellow scouts.

You may recall that Rokhy was diagnosed with Stage II breast cancer at the age of 45 in December of 2017. She was fortunate to find the tumor early herself and with her persistence, resilient attitude and the prayers and support of friends, family, and many in the community she was able to beat the cancer and began resuming her life. Life was promising again for Rokhy after the dreadful and difficult treatments came to an end. She slowly regained her energy and strength, and her hair eventually grew back. The following year, she witnessed her only child, Parto graduate from high school, and begin attending college. Rokhy also got a new job that she really loved and life was normal again. But, little did she or anyone could have known or predicted, there was another storm on the horizons for this mother-daughter duo. Hence, I am initiating another campaign and I am asking you again to offer your prayers and support. Sometime in the Fall of 2020, 19-year-old Parto began complaining of left hip pain. When X-rays of the hips were unremarkable, her doctors attributed the pain to “growing pains.” Around that time, Parto also had some back pain that would come and go. She was eventually diagnosed with kidney stones and after a couple of ER visits, she underwent an ureteroscopic stone removal surgery on November 8, 2020 at Mission Hospital, where the stones were successfully broken into smaller pieces using shockwave and eventually flushed out. The procedure was uncomplicated and Parto was scheduled to be discharged the next day. Meanwhile, her left hip pain continued and since Parto was already in the hospital, Rokhy insisted on an MRI, just as she had insisted on an MRI when she had found a lump in her own breast a couple of years earlier and had been assured by her doctors that an MRI was not necessary. Rokhy’s instance again turned out to be potentially life saving. The MRI showed a suspicious tumor near the left femur, as well as a fracture on the same femur. Further imaging on November 11, 2020 confirmed the diagnosis for a type of bone cancer known as osteosarcoma. Utter devastation, sadness, despair, shock and even anger does not even begin to describe how Rokhy and Parto felt upon being informed of yet another cancer diagnosis for this mother and daughter. Remember, I told you last time that this wasn’t the first time cancer had knocked on Rokhy’s door? Well, this wasn’t the second or third time either. This is the FOURTH time. At the age of only ten months, Parto was diagnosed with retinoblastoma (a rare cancer of the eye) in Iran. With the help of her brother Farzin who lives in New Mexico, Rokhy and Parto moved to the US and started cancer treatment at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. Rokhy spent months at her toddler daughter’s bedside at the hospital. Months of chemotherapy, radiation, countless follow up visits, scans, ER visits, and multiple hospitalizations ensued for the next almost three years until the cancer went into remission. Although Parto had recovered, the doctors told Rokhy that with childhood cancers, there is always an increased chance of recurrence within 10 years. Dreadfully, at the age of 11, Parto was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia. With her brother’s support again and the support of friends and the community, this strong and extraordinary mother and daughter persisted as they embarked on yet another grueling round of chemotherapy treatments, prolonged hospitalizations at Children’s Hospital Orange County, countless tests, and at times devastating medical set backs until the cancer thankfully went into remission.Life continued and the pair thrived as years passed. They had made Orange County their home and they loved it. Parto was a well-adjusted, happy, and thankfully a healthy teenager. She attended Capo Valley High School and was popular with a nice circle of good friends. Parto started college in the Fall of 2019 and was enjoying her classes. This has now changed, but hopefully temporarily. A tough battle lies ahead as Rokhy and Parto must now fight Parto’s third and their fourth collective bout with this ugly disease. This campaign has been launched by Sahel Alemansour and I with the permission of Rokhy and Parto. Please note that with the exception of the small administration fee that GoFundMe site takes from the donations to every campaign, every one of your kind donations will go directly to Rokhy and Parto to lighten the financial burden during this difficult period in their lives. Rokhy is a single mother and has not been able to return to her job since this diagnosis, and she will likely not be able to for at least another year. Parto has already started chemotherapy treatments. Depending on the tumor’s response to the treatment, she will hopefully undergo surgery in February 2021 to remove the tumor on the femur. Once she is strong enough after surgery, she will resume her chemotherapy treatments for a few more months. After that, Parto will need months of physical therapy and rehabilitation. Given the long duration of the treatments and the recovery process, our goal is to raise $150,000 in 60 days. Heroes are not fictional characters in cartoons or movies. Heroes are everyday people that do something, however large or small, to make a difference in the life of a person in need. We ask you to share this campaign with everyone you know and to keep Rokhy and Parto in your prayers. We will keep you abreast of Parto’s recovery and we thank you for your support.

This has been the most difficult year so far for Mark “Chew” Yanchewski and his ‘knee issues’. As of today, November 12th he has had 12 trips to the Operating Room and has spent 60 of the last 85 days in a Boston hospital and 15 days in a Rehabilitation hospital. In hospital speak; he’s had two readmits within 30 days – which is not good. He misses home and the normalcy of life. To say that he’s been laid up seems an understatement as he had his first surgery this year on June 10th, and was non-weight bearing post that time until Oct 24 when he became restricted to bed.

Mark and his surgeons are doing everything they can to save his left leg. All agree that he is too young and too active to be crippled with a high leg amputation (hip disarticulation). So, a difficult decision to take a long corrective path that would provide a better outcome has not been an easy decision for Chew. He knew that would mean that he would be unable to work, to coach football and to coach wrestling. He misses both the kids he coaches and the kids he works with every day in Special Education at Wellesley High School. Never mind all the activities he’s missed out on – like kayaking and attending his own son’s graduation from Navy Boot Camp. It’s hard to explain all that he has been going through but when dealing with nurses and doctors at the hospital you know it’s bad as they all express how sorry they feel for him making comments such as “he can’t catch a break”, “he’s been through so much”, and “how does he stay so positive through all of this”, etc. On a lighter note, he has formed new relationships with the nurses who have been working with him over these months. Many make comment at how positive he is and yes, some even laugh at his humor. Personally, I think it’s his faith that’s carrying him through this difficult time.

Late last year, Mark and I moved to a single level house. Much of this difficult decision was due to anticipated problems with his knees, our age and empty nesting. Although we are primarily on one level, he still needs handicapped access to the bedroom, the bathroom and the entry into the house. Unfortunately, since Mark has been out of work since June (both school and coaching), we are working with just my income. We simply can’t afford these renovations ourselves with a single income and medical related costs.

Currently, Chew is still in the hospital and has at least one more surgery planned for skin grafts. Once the reconstruction on his leg is improved, he will then move to a Rehabilitation hospital and have to gain back strength before he can go home. Once home, he will have to wait six months to return for a new knee, femur and tibia to be inserted. He’ll continue to be on multiple IV antibiotics much of the time, continuing to fight the new infections in his leg. Until then, he has a large antibiotic-coated rod bolted to his hip extending to his ankle – which means his leg cannot bend (as there is no knee in there). He will have to recover/rehab after the spring surgery as well. So, as you can see, he has a long road ahead.

We are asking for help to fund these specialized handicapped renovations so that he can maneuver more easily in his wheelchair when he can return home.

Chew is not the type of person that asks for help, so he’s not going to be comfortable with the fact that I have initiated this fund (I haven't told him yet). Frankly, I’m uncomfortable asking myself but many have asked me if there is anything that they can do to help. So, I’m hoping that people/families who Chew has coached, taught, or helped in any way over the years will find it in their hearts to help make it so that he can be safer at home, when he is finally able to return. 

So please SHARE and SHARE SOME MORE to reach those who know/knew Chew and might be able to help – in any way. If people would like to donate services instead of money, these too would be gladly accepted – maybe our own version of “Extreme Makeover”?

Thanks in advance for any/all help you can give in helping me get Chew home safely.

Eileen Yanchewski

The sanctuary’s mission is to be Canada’s leading wolfdog rescue that makes the rehabilitation and rehoming of displaced wolfdogs a priority. Since its conception in June 2011, Yamnuska Wolfdog Sanctuary has become home to 29 resident wolfdogs. Today, we continue to provide a forever home to these wolfdogs who have been neglected, abandoned or otherwise displaced while also balancing educational programs with a highly successful adoption program. To learn more about us please visit https://yamnuskawolfdogsanctuary.com/.We Need Your HelpFollowing the Public Health Agency of Canada’s recommendations, we had to make the tough decision to close and remain closed to the public to mitigate the risk of COVID-19. As a specialized animal rescue facility that relies mainly upon the revenue from daily visitors, tour operations and gift shop purchases, we are facing challenging times ahead.During this time of uncertainty, our priority is to remain committed to the safety of our community, staff, volunteers and resident wolfdogs. We are currently expanding our fundraising efforts to ensure that each member of our pack will continue to maintain the level of care and support that they need during this time of crisis. We are asking for your help, at whatever level you can afford, to champion the continuous welfare of the wolfdogs, for whom, without the sanctuary, would have nowhere else to go.Why $75,000.00?The COVID-19 pandemic has caused challenging times for everyone. From social distancing to mandatory home-schooling to layoffs from work, we are all feeling the effects whether that is financially, socially, mentally, physically or a combination of some or all of the above. As a non-profit organization that relies on the generosity and visitation of people like you, we are also experiencing the same effects.Since we have had to close our doors to the public in March, we are already seeing a major decrease in the number of donations, revenue and funds available. Caring for each wolfdog costs $1,800 per month per wolfdog. This cost includes aspects of animal care such as food, enrichment activities, maintenance of the enclosures and any necessary veterinary care that may arise. With having 29 wolfdogs in our care, this number adds up quickly. Your donations also will ensure that we are able to maintain our essential staff that has formed a meaningful, safe and secure bond with the wolfdogs and have been highly trained to maintain the essential level of care that each wolfdog requires. How Your Donations Will Make a DifferenceAny donation, on any scale, will make a positive impact for the wolfdogs at Yamnuska Wolfdog Sanctuary. Here is an example of how your donations will help:$10.00 - Feeds one wolfdog for one day$30.00 - Feeds one wolfdog for three days$60.00 - Covers all costs for one wolfdog for one day$120.00 - Covers all costs for one of the following packs for one day: Rundle, Castle, Temple, Galatea, Grotto, Norquay or Pocaterra Pack (2 Wolfdogs per enclosure)$200.00 - Covers all costs for either the Engadine or Cascade Pack (3 Wolfdogs per enclosure) for one day$300.00 - Covers all costs for the Yamnuska Pack (5 Wolfdogs) for one day
Thank You For Your SupportNow is an essential time for Yamnuska Wolfdog Sanctuary. We hope to be open again before summer; however, with no defined reopening date in sight, our goal is to raise enough funds to ensure that we are able to cover all operational costs while we are limited to what in-person services we are able to offer. Whether you are able to donate or choose to share our cause with your friends and family instead, any help will go a long way to aid us in our mission to provide a safe, loving and forever home for otherwise displaced wolfdogs.From all of us at Yamnuska Wolfdog Sanctuary, we wish you and your loved ones all the best during these times of uncertainty.Stay safe, stay healthy and keep your pack close!

Byron was involved in a life threatening /changing motorcycle accident right before Christmas while in Costa Rica. On the afternoon of December 23, 2020 Byron was traveling on a motorcycle with a friend Mainor Murillo in El Tanque 8km East of La Fortuna. When a large Semi truck pulling a trailer crossed the center line causing an accident; which lead to Byron and his friend being run over by the trailer back end. Byron sustained critical life threatening injuries and was transported by a costly private ambulance after waiting 45 mins plus in the rain for public ambulance after the accident. Byron has had 9 hours of emergency surgeries for internal bleeding and ruptured bladder. Subsequently he was transported by another ambulance to a hospital in San Jose, Costa Rica where he had orthopedic surgery to repair multiple fractures (knee, femur, hip, coccyx). Byron also has infections in several of his organs which were surgically repaired and/or impacted during the accident which require further testing/monitoring and may require additional treatment. Moreover, while in one of the hospitals, Byron also contracted Covid. This coupled with the recovery from the surgeries and infection of his organs means that the hospital stay will be longer than expected, followed by intensive rehabilitation and after-care support. We do not expect him to be able to walk by himself for several months and to be unable to work for 6-9 months.Many of you have already contributed to Byron’s GoFundMe fund, and we thank you all for your generosity. To date, upwards of USD $25,000 has been raised. Byron’s family has already covered some hospital bills for a total of about USD $19,000. However, additional invoices a total amount of USD $45,000 need to be paid immediately. Then additional funds will be required by the San Jose hospital for Byron to continue to receive care after the next three days, corresponding to about $25,000 for an additional 8 days.We are still considering an air ambulance to repatriate him to California as soon as he is physically able, and this would cost about USD $40,000. Otherwise he would stay in Costa Rica for the next 6 to 8 weeks before he can sit and take a commercial flight (assuming no other medical complications).We are therefore in need of additional funds to make sure that Byron will have the short term and long term care that he needs.The current funds in the GoFundMe fund + Byron’s family’s payments just partially cover his current bills, and we need to immediately raise an additional $70,000 ($45k for current hospital bills, + $25k for the extended hospital stay and care).After that, Byron will also need help for his rehabilitation and in home care costs for 3-4 months or at least until he can be mobile or travel back to CA, which we expect to cost $2-3k per month.Byron is looking forward to recovering and standing on his own 2 feet (both literally and figuratively), and he is getting love and support from his family, but he will be unable to work for 6-9 months assuming his recovery goes perfectly. We would greatly appreciate any help that our friends and family can provide. Please donate any amount you can, big or small.Thank you

He was very badly battered by the impact of the vehicle, and has experienced severe swelling and bleeding in his brain among his many injuries. The doctors performed a craniectomy to help alleviate the swelling in Cooper's brain, but it will be some time before the full extent of his brain injury is known, and he will likely face extensive rehabilitation.None of the medical care that Cooper received in Mexico will be covered by his insurance.

He was hit in his head so hard that he was knocked out while standing , fell backwards to the ground, hitting his head on the asphalt, then had a seizure. The other kid ran and fled the scene, while a couple of boys helped Cooper while he was seizing. Elisha and her family rushed to the Brigham City ER. Cooper was absolutely out of it and was not making sense at all and his poor little body was in shock. Within the first few hours that he was there he had seized 5 times. Cooper was then life-flighted to Primary Children’s Hospital Trauma Unit, and was admitted to the ICU, and intubated for 48 hours. Cooper has several skull fractures as well as bleeding on his brain and bruising. WHY IS THIS URGENT? Cooper was not insured at the time of the incident. Elisha was in the process of adding Cooper to her medical plan, but with open enrollment, we all know that coverage will not be effective until January 1st 2020. Funds will help with hospital bills and Cooper’s ongoing rehab to ensure he is getting the proper care. In the event there are funds over the amount needed, Elisha is going to advocate and bring awareness to the severity of what can happen when kids fight and what a brain injury can do to our youth. Elisha will also give back to kids in need in our hospitals and any fundraisers for those in need.Cooper will have a long road to recovery. Cooper does not remember much about the event and his memory has suffered, he will need rehabilitation/ occupational therapy going forward. Cooper will not be able to return to school in a normal fashion and he will have to be home schooled for some time. A brain injury is very serious and if anything happens to Cooper over the next few months it could very well put him back into the hospital and the damages will be worse.Most of you know Elisha Ward. She is one of the most positive and giving people that I know, and I can say that, because I have known here since I was a wee lass. Elisha is always taking care of everyone else, and is always one of the first people to reach out and offer help, volunteer her time and money for whatever cause or fundraiser there is. Elisha is a single mother, raising 2 boys the best she can, and she always gives all she has to her boys, friends and strangers, and rarely takes the time for herself. If you know Elisha like I do, she is also very prideful. She never asks for help on anything, she just buckles down and jumps in with both feet. And so when she said, Kate, I need help, I knew that her even asking for help was very hard for her.Friends, it is time for us to rally around this Momma and help her, the way she helps everyone else.The case is being investigated, so any information we have as far as what is going to happen next, is in the hands of the county attorneys.Elisha also has a Venmo account if you would rather donate that way - @Elisha-Ward-1Read more"

Dan Crines has a very rare form of cancer called Sezary Syndrome, which is a form of Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma. This cancer has been wreaking havoc on his body for several years, and unfortunately his treatments are becoming ineffective. His best option for what is being called by his medical team @ The Abrams Cancer Center (Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania) a long term durable remission is an Allogeneic Stem Cell transplant. This is considered by medical professionals as one of the most challenging procedures known to modern medicine. Most everyone who knows Dan knows he is intensely loyal and loving to his family and friends. If you call Dan for help, all he will say is “I’ll be right there.” He wears his heart on his sleeve and if you are hurting, then he is hurting. He embraces an incredible work ethic, which has shown in just about everything he does. Needless to say, grass doesn’t grow under Dan’s feet! But most importantly, Dan is a fighter. Before the pandemic threatened him with his compromised immune system, Dan worked full time through all of his treatments to provide for his family. And when Dan isn’t working, he is out running the Ocean City Boardwalk or Linwood Bike Path for miles to get physically and mentally ready for the new fight ahead. The one thing left out is that he is the ultimate father and husband. His first born is off to college this year and he actually asked the doctors to delay his transplant so that he can be there to make sure Cameron is settled and safe during such a huge life transition. He and his wife, Tracy, are partners in every sense of the word and their marriage and devotion to one another is one that most of us could only hope for.Now, think about all I just said and then think about that guy in bed and in isolation. That is going to be Dan’s reality very soon. And while he is hopeful and grateful for a chance at a long-term remission, the reality of the treatment is daunting. For, as if the typical hair loss and incredible pain and nausea from the treatment were not enough, his biggest burden will be his inability to provide for his family during his long rehabilitation. Dan will be unable to work for over a year; instead, he’ll be fighting against his body’s natural instinct to reject the new stem cells while also avoiding potentially deadly infections due to his suppressed immune system. And although Dan will qualify for medical disability, the cost of living with this cancer far exceeds what Dan is entitled to. With a child starting college and another only three years behind… the reality of the financial consequences of this fight is crushing.Anyone that knows Dan knows that everything mentioned above about him is true and, perhaps, even a bit understated. They also know that if the cancer or treatment does not devastate him, the inability to provide for his family just might. Therefore, much to his embarrassment, we are asking anyone that can help to please give what you can. If you know Dan, then you know that he would certainly do the same for you. On behalf of Dan, his family, and friends… we thank you for anything you can do to help.Read more"

During the night around 4 am Rowan awoke complaining of pain in his legs and back. By 5 am he was in the emergency department at the Saint John Regional Hospital and unable to walk or stand. A CT scan showed a large blood clot on his spine and by 10 am he was in the operating room for emergency surgery. He was then rushed by air ambulance to the IWK Children's Hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia for futher treatment.Rowan had no sensation from his feet to his upper chest.It was hoped that as the incision healed and time passed feeling would return. This hope was quickly replaced with worry and after one day Rowan was diagnosed with Spinal AVM. This is a growth of abnormally large arteries and veins around the spinal cord resulting in a bleed. The result and the reality is that Rowan is permanently paralyzed.With the paralysis starting so high up, he has trouble coughing and has no control of his abdominal muscles. We can only hope and pray that over time and with therapy, the mobility of his upper limbs will improve.On May 17, Rowan was transferred to the Stan Cassidy Center in Fredericton, NB resulting in a two hour round trip for his family to visit him. He has a lengthy period of rehabilitation ahead of him to develop as much mobility in his arms as possible.Amazingly, Rowan is helping his family deal with their despair. He is going about the business of getting on with life. He ask questions like ""Will I still be able to go to school?"" and ""Can I still play with my friends?"". He looks forward to getting into his wheelchair and exploring the hospital. He has occupied his recent days going to therapy and learning how to do all the little things we take for granted over again. We are amazed at his attitude and bravery.Rowan lives at his grandparents, Bernie and Veniene, with his mother Candance, his brother AJ and his cousins Makayla, Lydia and Jayden. A very busy household and they are all anxious to get Rowan home with them. Veniene and Candance have been with Rowan at the IWK and are now at the Stan Cassidy Center since the beginning.

She was having problems with her oxygenation.On August 17, the doctors intubated her because her lungs were not responding to the treatments. She spent three weeks intubated and did not respond. At the same time, she was still testing positive for the virus. Her doctors recommended the tracheotomy because she could get a chest infection since she was three weeks intubated. Based on the recommendations from doctors, we decided to do the tracheotomy on September 18. two days later, after her surgery, she had a heart attack, and she was 4 minutes without oxygen. They did the CPR and were able to resuscitate her. They did a ct scan on the brain. The results came in, and due to the four minutes without oxygen in her brain, it caused damage to the cerebral cortex. Being in the hospital for 109 days, 90 days in ICU, 60 days positive with the virus, on Friday, November 20, they gave us no choice but to take her home or to a rehabilitation center.This Gofundme has been created to assist the family with the financial burden of medical expenses.

Since we opened in 2004, we have returned nearly 200 cubs to the wild. Every year we receive approximately 10 cubs but there have been years when we have had over 20.Den disturbance is the leading cause for cub abandonment in Romania. As mothers and cubs get disturbed in their den, usually by logging activities, their instinct to flee takes over. Sometimes the cubs are too young to keep up with their mothers so they get left behind. Collisions with vehicles, both cars and trains, are another main reason why cubs become orphans.The rehabilitation process usually takes between one and two years. During this time, the orphaned cubs enjoy a completely natural environment, young spruce forests, willows and lots of raspberry bushes. The cubs learn to forage for grubs and vegetation and how to dig their own dens for their winter sleep.We have minimal contact with the cubs and human access is restricted in the project area. We place additional supplemented food with the use of a drone so the cubs do not associate humans with the food.Unfortunately, recently the drone we use for feeding the bear cubs crashed. One of the engines exploded mid flight and the drone collapsed breaking into pieces. The drone was custom made for the project and did not come with a warranty. We contacted the manufacturer to let them know what happened as this drone was less than a year old but they have not responded to any of our efforts to contact them. As such we have the challenge of raising the funds to buy a new one. A new drone, from a company that can offer us a warranty for a custom design, costs in excess of £12 000.Until we are able to buy a new drone, we have to carry the food sacks on our backs to the bear enclosures. This is very physically demanding and time consuming as the terrain is steep and rough. We also have to wait, sometimes for over 1 hour at a time, in order to be able to put down the food without being seen by the cubs. Even so, we still risk being seen or heard by the cubs which could hinder their rehabilitation process.Please help us give these beautiful animals the best chance to a normal life back in the wild. A new drone would greatly reduce our contact with the cubs and it would also allow our small team to spend more time developing the infrastructure for the project.A massive thank you from Leo, Gabriel, Maria and all the cubsRead more"

T1D is when thebody cannot produce insulin, the key hormone needed for the body to absorb sugar in the bloodstream. Without a way to absorb any consumed sugars, the body's sugar levels can spike or drop dangerously beyond levels that are safe for a human. T1D is not caused by something that Sarah did, or did not do. It's an autoimmune disease where her pancreas has stopped working. There is not yet a cure.The Game ChangerFor the last 3 years, Sarah and her parents, Lori and Andrew, have been manually monitoring Sarah's insulin levels and food intake carefully. Sarah's Dad, Andrew, is a volunteer firefighter and has answered several calls where an individual has collapsed from extremely low blood sugar. These instances have caused Lori and Andrew to realize the absolute need to transition Sarah to a Continuous Glucose Monitor. which will alert her parents to any significant spike/drop in blood sugar and she would be much safer, especially when she's sleeping. Her Endocrinologist has also recommended a pump for her insulin intake, she currently needs 4-6 shots a day, and a pump would eliminate that as well as giving her more food freedom, and help her to bring her A1C back into a safe range. They would like to get her set up with this much safer system as quickly as possible.Why are they in need of finances?Last September (2016), Sarah's Dad, Andrew, was in a car accident where he sustained a severe neck injury. Since that time, he has completed a surgery and is currently doing rehabilitation therapy. Ongoing medical costs meanthere are no extra funds just laying around to scrape together.

February 17, 2020 - Mipri was found in full cardiac arrest. The paramedics were able to find a faint pulse, unfortunately, she had been without oxygen for approximately 30 minutes. Mipri has suffered some brain damage due to the extended period of time without oxygen. Mipri is a 19 year old Sophomore at Rowan University studying to become an Attorney.

Mipri also works at TD Bank in Customer Service. Mipri is fun, loving, caring, outgoing and most importantly full of LIFE. 

Currently, Mipri is in a coma-like state. She is completely unresponsive and needs a ventilator to assist with breathing. Soon Mipri will undergo surgery as part of her treatment and rehabilitation.

Mipri’s mother, Capri, has not left her side since this unexpected tragedy has happened. She has yet to fully return to work as she is sitting by Mipri’s bedside and attending to her on-going Medical needs. 

We are seeking financial assistance for Mipri's increasingly high medical bills, while currently hospitalized & for future rehabilitation costs. Insurance will only cover a small portion of her medical bills, so the remaining balance will rest on her family. 

Any amount donated will help and will be greatly appreciated. 

Mipri has a lot more LIFE to LIVE!

He loved spending time with his family and being a dad to Anna (almost 4). He also loved his job as a 3rd grade teacher where his students adored him as much as he adored them. And when you think of James, it’s not without a guitar in hand or his music. But unfortunately, he is now in the fight of his life.On January 9th, James received a steroid shot for back pain. Two days later, in excruciating pain, he went to the ER. They told him he had an arthritic hip, gave him morphine and pain pills and sent him home. Hours later in the early hours of January 12th, when there was no relief from the pain, James was admitted to Henry Ford Hospital (Detroit, MI), where he has been and will continue to be in their Surgical ICU. The pain James was experiencing was from a bacterial infection that traveled very quickly through his blood. His body went into septic shock, his organs began to shut down and he was taken into emergency surgery. He has since had 6 surgeries, he remains on intermittent kidney dialysis and most other organs have been affected. But it gets worse. What began as a bacterial infection, developed into a highly aggressive form of necrotizing fasciitis (flesh eating bacteria); an extremely rare and destructive disease. All 6 surgeries have been performed on James right leg & buttocks, each one requiring the surgeons to remove more tissue and muscle to stop the infection from spreading. The medicine they used to save his life starved his extremities of proper blood flow. After his last surgery, the family received devastating news; James is facing the complete or partial amputation of every limb. James' right leg was removed Wednesday January 31st, saving just8 inches from the hip. James will also lose both hands (how far up the arms is still to be determined). And his left foot. His doctor told the family that James is the worst case he has ever seen and his road to recovery will take years. We are not sure when James will get out of the hospital or when he will return to work, if ever. So we have set up this page for those that want to help James, his wife Jessica, and his daughter Anna. The long road ahead will include physical and emotional rehabilitation, prostheses, alterations to their house, a handicapped vehicle and so many other obstacles and challenges. Your donation will allow James and his family to begin this long and difficult journey while alleviating the stress and uncertainty posed by the current and future mounting medical bills. If you are able to help in any way, the family greatly appreciates it. They thank everyone who has already been there to support them and ask that you continue to keep James and the family in your thoughts and prayers. All of their lives have been forever changed.

Your support is valued and appreciated, whether in the form of warm meals and financial assistance, or prayers and positive energy.As some of you may know, on January 3rd, Gina began experiencing some numbness and tingling ranging from her lower extremities up to her pelvis. Her symptoms rapidly progressed, causing complete paralysis from the navel down through her lower extremities, and in most of her face. She was initially diagnosed with Guillain–Barré syndrome, defined by Mayo Clinic as “a rare disorder in which your body’s immune system attacks your nerves. These sensations can quickly spread, eventually paralyzing your whole body.” As a follow-up to this diagnosis, she began to receive Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a standard treatment for GBS. Unfortunately, the IVIG did not produce the results that her family and doctors were hoping for.Gina’s symptoms quickly continued to spread, with the severity of her paralysis in her arms and hands coming in waves, starting with numbness and tingling, before complete paralysis would set in. After a month of worsening symptoms, including a reduced ability to speak, breathe and swallow on her own, she was intubated and put on life support on February 4th.Doctors believe she may have the chronic form of GBS, Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP), rather than the acute form. Regardless, rehabilitation is expected to take months, if not years. Gina, who has owned her own business and managed her home-farm for decades, will no longer be able to work. The financial assistance obtained from this go-fund me will initially be used to cover any medical necessities not covered by insurance, and to cover bills that she is unable to pay while being hospitalized. Once Gina is weaned from life support, and begins her recovery at home, funds will be used to create a handicap accessible space (room, bathroom, etc.) and vehicle, as well as cover her cost of living for her and Kian while she works toward recovering. Gina’s every effort should be focused on her recovery, and we’d like to ensure that money is the last of her worries.Read more"

Graham is an incredible spouse, son, brother, uncle, friend, Journeyman Red Seal Instrument Mechanic at Canfor, athlete, runner, skier, hiker, two-stepping partner, nature lover, and an overall amazingly talented and kind-hearted gentleman. When he wasn’t at work at Canfor’s Northwood Pulp Mill, you could see Graham taking his two Labrador retrievers for an adventure hike, fishing at Purden lake with family, skiing the deepest powder, working on a new project for the house, or grabbing a beer at the local brewery with friends.On October 4th, Graham was struck by a vehicle in the pedestrian crosswalk at Ospika Blvd and Davis Ave in Prince George while out for a jog before work. He was rushed to the UHNBC hospital in Prince George with several broken bones and a severe head injury. He was immediately put on life support. His partner, Julie, arrived on the scene shortly after it happened looking for him as he hadn’t returned to the house when she had expected. She IDed him and rushed to the hospital, calling his mom on the way. That night he was flown to Vancouver General Hospital due to the condition of his brain. His injuries included: skull fractures, traumatic brain injuries, and several other fractures. He underwent several surgeries to repair his leg, as well as his clavicle. They installed an Intercranial Pressure monitor and have discovered seizure activity in his brain. Graham is still in the Intensive Care Unit in VGH but he is not able to respond to commands at this time. His brain injuries are very severe and are dispersed throughout his brain. While his broken bones will heal, his brain is still a huge question mark. These injuries will require Graham to undergo extensive rehabilitation over the next couple years including speech therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, etc. Julie was able to fly down with Graham and has been by his side ever since. These injuries will affect both of them for the rest of their lives.The donations from the page will be put towards supporting Graham and his partner, Julie, in order to pay bills, mortgage payments, and travel and living expenses, as well as to create a savings for their uncertain future. Julie and Graham’s mother, Kathy, are staying in Vancouver while he begins this long journey. We anticipate that in the immediate future Graham will not be returning to his job as an instrument technician. We do not want him to worry about financial burdens as he begins his recovery.If you have met Graham or his family, you would have encountered their kindness and support of the Prince George Community that they have always called home. His mother, Kathy, has touched the hearts of many through her time at UHNBC, UNBC, and CNC. His father, Scott, recently retired from Finning in Prince George. Graham’s spouse, Julie, works at Chernoff Thompson Architects North in Prince George as an Intern Architect, recently graduated from the University of Calgary. Graham’s older brother, Sean, as well as his wife, Anita, and their son Gerrik, are also active members in the community.Your donation is greatly appreciated by Graham’s friends and family. Any amount will help ease the financial stress that he will experience when he regains consciousness and throughout the rest of his life. Any donation helps. If you cannot donate, please take the time to share the gofundme link with your friends and family. Thank you so much for your help in Graham’s recovery.Read more"

He fought for his life for more than 16 days in Intensive Care Unit and the fight continues as he struggles with short term memory loss and reduced mobility.Sometimes in life, you can only comprehend the word tragedy when it hits you in a way that your mind is unable to process the dimensions of it. Tragically, it did to me and my family when we started receiving messages on Facebook on 1/10/2020 that the community members in Australia are looking for the family of Danyal Waheed who is unconscious and in ICU. What happened after still shatters my heart and I feel the pain that I did that day for my younger brother. Pakistani Embassy reached out to us and informed us that my brother has severe brain injuries and have been a victim of physical assault and police will contact us to give the authorization to speak to the doctors in the hospital. It took us almost 20 hours from that point onwards to be able to speak to the doctors. He got severe brain injuries, his lungs were punctured, he had broken ribs, damaged liver, injured stomach, damaged kidneys, face laceration, he had chest injuries, broken hip joints, fractures in the neck and blood clots in his legs and was on oxygen support. It’s been a long journey after that including constant procedures, x-rays, the windpipe removed from the mouth and inserted directly into the throat (tracheostomy), scans, waiting every 24 hours until our contact person would visit Danyal in the hospital and do a video chat with us as Danyal wasn’t able to speak. Danyal has remained at the Alfred hospital in Melbourne (Australia) for more than a month and two weeks at the rehabilitation facility. Danyal has post-traumatic brain injury leaving him with a disability to conduct complex tasks, and it remains unclear as to when and if he can return to work or study. He has short term memory issues as to recalling things that happened a day before and also doesn’t have the memory from the past few months. He still has the hip joints fractured restricting his mobility and currently attending to very basic needs (going to the toilet) with crutches. We have no close family or relative in Australia. When the incident happened, Pakistan Welfare Organisation in Australia came to rescue us & helped, from that point onwards the representative of the organisation has relentlessly helped us in the process by constant visits to the hospital, maintaining communication with the doctors and ensuring my brother’s wellbeing. Another member of the community has helped us in Danyal’s wellbeing and alternatively visited Danyal each day to make sure we can speak to Danyal and can see him. Me and my parents are far away from Danyal so he has no emotional support available. Danyal have been discharged from the rehab facility with many pending procedures. Danyal has to go through physiotherapies, brain MRI, chest x-rays, pelvic x-rays IVC device removal which was inserted to prevent life-threatening pulmonary emboli, this device is still in his body and needs to be removed. The hospital bill is almost AUD 200,000.00 and the remaining procedure costs will need to be paid upfront so if we cannot gather the money his rehabilitation will not be possible. My family has no such assets or resources to cover this huge amount. Danyal was studying mechanics until the corona pandemic happened and due to scarcity of jobs, he wasn’t able to continue with his insurance which is further aggravating the situation. Danyal has been in an unfortunate situation and circumstances, and we all can give him another good chance at a life where he can learn, grow and start a new life back home. He desperately wants to return home (Pakistan) to be with the family. However, he cannot fly yet because of operated lungs, and he needs to do the scans so the doctor can give him a green light to fly home. Another complication is his hip fracture because of which he is unable to sit more than 20 minutes without the hip and leg getting numb. He still has nerve pain in his right leg and restricted movement that require physiotherapies on time. PWOA (Pakistan Welfare Organisation in Australia) will be helping to monitor the funds raised through this campaign to pay the hospital bill and for pending therapies, and the family taking care of Danyal will be taking him to all his appointments. How is Danyal? We are grateful for his life. It’s a miracle that he is alive despite of what happened. I am appealing this on Danyal's behalf because I don’t want him to go through this alone and no one should go through such a horrifying experience on his own. Danyal is a kind, intelligent guy full of life, love and hope, helping people around him, and who had a bright future ahead of him. What he needs now more than anything is the support of people to help him get back to his life and we can hope that his brain injuries won't be an hindrance to that. Every dollar will matter to save Danyal's life and help him have a new start where his brain and body can function normally.WHO AM I? I am Danyal Waheed's elder sister and I am from Pakistan. I am appealing for this support on Danyal's behalf as he is currently unable to do this himself. I have informed Danyal that there are so many people out there who wants to give him a new chance at life and he is very hopeful that he can have his pending procedures done.President of PWOA ( non-profit Pakistan Welfare Organisation in Australia) named Syed Muhammad Abbas Abidi (resident in Australia) is authorised next to the kin for Danyal in Australia as no one of the family can reach to Australia and the organisation is helping us organise this fund.All the funds will go into their (PWOA) account. The money collected will be used by PWOA to pay the hospital bill and for pending treatments as mentioned (physiotherapies, NonContrast CT Brain, N/Surg R/V, Pelvis XRAY, C Spine XRAY, ORTHO R/V, Chest XRAY, IVC Filter Removal which was inserted to prevent life-threatening pulmonary emboli, this device is still in his body and needs to be removed, physiotherapies and GP's visits).Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions!In case you are donating from Europe and have troubles making the payment.

These tables lift plants off the ground to protect against the disease Phytophthora. This nursery produces over 20,000 plants / year for the restoration of endangered and rare species habitat. To fund this project I need to raise $825 to buy the materials for five of these specialized tables. If you can chip in a few dollars, it would really mean a lot to me in order to help me get my Eagle just like my dad, and blaze the trail for many females in Scouting to come.

On the 14th February, 2020 the Dahms family had their lives flipped upside down. Ethan was walking to school, with his twin brother Hayden, when he was hit by a car.

Ethan was rushed, lights and sirens, to hospital where he was placed in an induced coma. He had acquired a severe traumatic brain injury. The situation was extremely critical. Ethan remained in this coma for a long nine weeks. The intensive care stay was gruelling for both Ethan and his family. He had broken bones, a section of his skull removed to assist with reducing brain swelling, a half body cast to protect his brain and spine, drains and tubes in place... a traumatic experience no 13 year old should go through.Over the next few months, Ethan began to make a slow recovery. Hours and hours of demanding rehabilitation and therapies. Ethan continues to learn how to eat, talk and walk again. He has made such amazing progress, but the rehabilitation journey has just begun. Due to such circumstances, members of Ethan’s family have had to leave their jobs to accommodate such appointments and intensive therapies.This page has been started to help this beautiful family cover the day to day expenses of life, upgrades required around the home, and hopefully a much needed relaxing family holiday. Your generosity is greatly appreciated.

As anyone who knows them would say, Mary Lu and Robert are a selfless and loving couple. They enjoy adventures together, and creating new memories.Both have always had a special connection to motors, and love riding motorcycles. On May 4th, they jumped on a beautiful black Harley and took off from their home in Henderson, Nevada for what was supposed to be a leisurely ride to Gunlock, Utah.Unfortunately, their ride came to an abrupt end before they reached Gunlock. They were on Old Highway 91, near the Utah/Arizona border, and saw a vehicle veering toward them in their lane. Mary Lu screamed, ”Robert!”, and he told her to ”hang on“! He veered to the right but the driver of the vehicle still managed to hit them almost head on.They were both thrown into the dirt and gravel on the side of the road. Mary Lu’s left leg, and Robert’s left foot were immediately severed during the impact. But, God was watching over them and sent angels to the scene. These angels had the strength, knowledge and training to provide urgently needed medical aide. They literally saved their lives, using belts as tourniquets. Our families are forever grateful for their heroic actions.Mary Lu and Robert were airlifted by two helicopters from the scene. They suffered traumatic, extensive injuries, beyond the tragedy of their amputated limbs. Each of them has undergone multiple surgeries over the past few days and endured excruciating pain.The driver of the vehicle was arrested for DUI, causing severe bodily injury, among other charges, including driving on a revoked/suspended license and having no insurance.Mary Lu’s injuries: Left leg amputation, broken ribs, broken collar bone, broken left pinky finger, and extreme road rash.Robert’s injuries: Left leg amputation under the knee, broken ribs, broken collar bone, and broken/cracked sternum that is requiring surgery to put plates in.We know the financial impact of this tragedy will be tremendous and it is for that reason we created this Go Fund Me page. We are hoping to put their minds at ease so that they can focus on their recovery. Undoubtedly, they will need additional surgeries, prosthetics, special accommodations, and mental support for years to come.Our families appreciate any and all donations for this beautiful couple who have always been so generous and loving toward everyone they meet. God bless and please keep them in your prayers.

Thank you so much.

This type of stroke is very rare (1% chance) of developing Locked in Syndrome or LIS. This is a horrific neurological condition in which Brandon is fully aware and can hear what is going on around him. Brandon has all his cognitive abilities but is unable to speak or move any muscle. Brandon can only can move his eyes up or down. The only way he can communicate is with Yes or No questions; raising his eyes up for yes and down for no. He is totally paralyzed.  Imagine waking up and not knowing what happened to you and not being able to speak or move a muscle. The doctors have told us Brandon will need around-the-clock care and massive amounts of therapy and even then cannot say what Brandon will regain, if anything.  Everything we have read about “Locked In Syndrome” says that with fast, intense rehabilitation there is a better chance of recovery. We are struggling with getting all the care he needs with the insurance. Many therapies are not covered.   Brandon already has made huge strides in recovery by getting off the ventilator; only 50% of LIS patients ever get off the vent. Over the weekend he furrowed his eyebrows for the first time and coughed which is huge!  Brandon is strong in body and mind and if anyone can recover he can but he needs all the help he can get. He needs therapy to work on swallowing skills as to not aspirate and coughing as well as communication with his eyes. Brandon had a PEG (feeding tube) placed Friday and is now in the step down unit of the hospital. We are awaiting his transfer to a post-acute facility with 24/7 skilled care this week to start his journey of recovery. Brandon has a hard road ahead in which very few have traveled and needs our help to survive. He needs therapy and help with the tools he needs to communicate; any donation will be helpful and appreciatedAll monies will go to Brandon Williams care handled by his mother, Cindy Lacy.Read more"

His hand is currently immobile and he unable to do anything. Both of his children Atticus age 3 and Berlin age 17months are struggling to understand why daddy can’t do anything with them. Jay is actively involved in his kids lives and this accident has affected them all greatly.

In the coming months he will have many specialist appointments and have to do physical therapy 2-3X per week at the Royal Alexandra hospital from their he will be transferred to the Glenrose rehabilitation hospital in Edmonton AB to continue treatment learning how to live with out his fingers. Jay will be out of work for the next 6-8 months at minimum. Jay is the families main financial supporter, with out his income things will be financially difficult.

Our friends and neighbor's, Tim & Cassie Merrifield, are going through a very difficult time. Their son, Drew (14), broke his neck in a trampoline accident on Tuesday evening, June 30, 2020. He was very lucky to have survived the accident and is now in the hands of the amazing doctors and nurses at Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.Drew recently graduated from Twin Peaks Middle School and is an excellent and beloved student, in addition to being an active and athletic young man . Drew was a Poway All-Star baseball player, continues to play after Little League, and is looking forward to starting Poway High School and being a part of their baseball team. He loves any opportunity to go fishing with his dad, hang out with friends, and do tricks on the trampoline. We always enjoy seeing him out walking his dog, Lola, with his older brother Colton.Drew had surgery on Tuesday night approximately 4 hours after the injury. The surgery was to fuse his C2 & C3 vertebrae. Our understanding is that the spinal cord was not severed, but was pinched or bruised. He had very limited movement for the first couple of days and is unable to breathe fully on his own. On Thursday, July 3rd, we received very uplifting news that Drew was moving his feet and having tingling sensations in his legs. On Friday, July 4th, we learned that he is able to move additional body parts and is having physical therapy 3 times a day. He is communicating by blinking his eyes and they have worked out a system with a whiteboard for communication. The next hurdle is to get him breathing on his own. Drew's team of doctors have said his turnaround and progress is impressive. The doctors have also made it clear that each person reacts differently, and the road to recovery for this type of injury is a marathon, not a sprint. The Merrifields have expressed how strong Drew is and that he is a ""fighter"".We are all heartbroken and hurting for their family and want to do something to help ease some of their worry. We all know that it could have been any one of us, and can't imagine what they are dealing with. We have started this GoFundMe to provide them assistance with Drew's medical costs, rehabilitation costs, and any necessary future expenses. Despite having medical insurance, their portion will be extremely expensive. In addition, both Tim & Cassie's employment continues to be affected by the COVID-19 shutdowns and is already causing financial concerns for their family. Drew's recovery and rehabilitation is expected to be a full-time job for some time. Drew Merrifield is the beneficiary of this fund and Tim & Cassie Merrifield have been given the access to withdraw the funds as needed for Drew's expenses. They have expressed how grateful and humbled they are by your outpouring of support.GoFundMe does not charge for using their website. There is a 3% charge by the credit card processing company which is standard.

On June 29th 2020, I will undertake to RUN from Malin Head to Mizen Head....600+ km in one week to raise funds for Cappagh Kids. Cappagh Kids is a charity close to my heart........In 2017, my son Michael was diagnosed with Osteofibrous Dysplasia in his left tibia and so began our journey with the National Orthopaedic (Cappagh) Hospital. Overtime, without intervention Michael’s shin would break easily and was likely to deform. Surgery was the only option, if any, of fixing the bone. Over the past four years Michael has had countless surgeries and related treatments. Michaels treatment and rehabilitation has taken place at Cappagh under the exceptional expertise and care of Mr Connor Green and his team. Cappagh, the National Orthopaedic Hospital, is primarily an adult hospital, but with many children travelling from all over Ireland to avail of the unique orthopaedic specialist skills and equipment. I have seen first hand hand how child friendly facilities are crucial but non-existent at present.


Cappagh Hospital Foundation is the charity that raises funds for the hospital and the funds I raise will go towards supporting the purchase of critical equipment needed for ‘Cappagh Kids’ the new Department of Paediatric Orthopaedics at National Orthopaedic Hospital including but not limited to exam tables for the clinic rooms; equipment for the physio room; digital x-ray machine for theatre; and therapy garden equipment. Michaels journey, the team who have treated him and the many people we have met at Cappagh along the way have inspired me to undertake this RUN in an effort to raise these much needed funds. All funds raised from GoFundme will be transferred to Cappagh Hospital Foundation for Cappagh Kids.Any donation would be greatly appreciated,Thanks a million,Barry.

My brother Romik was unlawfully shot on January 28, 2021. We thank God daily that he survived. Unfortunately, because of the shooting, my brother has been in the hospital for almost 2 months battling multiple serious injuries including: a fracture on his vertebrae and injuries to his large intestine with an open wound into the cavity and through his flesh and skin both of which are on going and doctors continue to treat. As of now, his right leg is completely paralyzed. For as long as I can remember my brother has always been athletic and active. Seeing him forced into a sedentary life is heartbreaking.To date, he has undergone 4 major surgeries since the incident. Imaginably so, he has been bedridden for well over 1 month. My family has appropriately hired an attorney to address the unjust and unlawful incident. Followed the incident and while he has been in the hospital, his house was robbed multiple times. Sadly, all his personal belongings including, cash, undergarments, clothing, jewelry, televisions, and much more of his valued belongings were taken.Despite these tragic stream of events, we continue to remain hopeful for my brother’s full recovery and pray for his health and happiness. However during this very challenging time in his life, I started this gofundme account to help my brother rebuild.These funds will be withdrawn and directly handed to my brother in order for him to be able to cover some of his medical bills, and will be used to transfer him to a physical rehabilitation center. Any amount of donation will be hugely appreciated. If you’re unable to donate funds, please take a few moments to echo our prayers for him as he has a long journey of healing ahead. We believe in the collective power of prayer and hope. Romik is a loving and kind soul ready to live the rest of his life and lend a helping hand to those in need. Thank you massively in advance for considering to be a part of his journey through your donations and prayers.

Maurice Loehmann, Jr. (Dec 21st, 1952 - April 30th, 2020)*******************************************************************************HIS STORY:Mo Loehmann was an exceptionally caring friend, father, husband, brother, and brother-in-law over the 67 years of his life. Born and raised in Terre Haute, Indiana, he fell in love with Christine Duperon and they married in October 1975. From a young age Mo had a passion for dirt bikes, Indy cars, and photography. After moving out west through Boise and the Tri-Cities, Mo and Chris finally settled in Portland, Oregon in the mid '80s. In February 1994, their family came together as they adopted their child, Elizabeth (myself).Over the years, Dad worked for various TV news stations as a videographer. He made many friends and touched many hearts with his kind, gentle demeanor. In his free time Dad would ride Vintage Motocross, go to Indy car races, and photograph almost anything you can think of. (His favorite being scenery and of course his family.) He led a fulfilling life that unfortunately took a turn for the worse twice in his life.At the age of 56, Chris passed away from ALS and early on-set dementia. This shook the entire foundation of Dad's life. He was heartbroken, and suddenly had to raise a 15yo kid by himself. He did an amazing job while continuing to work at News Channel 8 (KGW) while taking care of me. Dad was my hero through and through. After being forced into retirement, he found joy in volunteering at the World of Speed museum on the weekends. However, it became clear that Dad was very depressed and he never moved passed the death of his life-long love.Dad's health began to mirror his broken heart. In 2015, we took Dad to the hospital after becoming nearly unconscious from lack of oxygen. He then had to begin frequently using oxygen. Two years later Dad had a heart attack and was diagnosed with congestive heart failure, but he continued to fight through it. In November 2018, Dad moved back to Terre Haute where he could be with his sisters. Shortly after in April 2019 he was diagnosed with non-alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver (liver failure), then followed kidney failure in October. During my visit in December 2019, he was placed into the hospital for low blood pressure.Even while enduring all of the medical hardships, Dad tried to make the best of his life. He reached out to old friends back on the west coast to reconnect, giving him a beam of light rekindling old friendships. Dad also continued to cook and spend time with his two dogs, Sam (12) and Milo (2). His dogs were the highlight of his photography in the last few years of his life.During the peak of COVID-19, Dad continued his dialysis treatment three times a week. April 17th, 2020 he was placed into the hospital after falling episodes. He was told he would come home May 7th after rehabilitation. However, by April 27th his ammonia levels skyrocketed, leaving him confused and ultimately shut down the rest of his body after he was struggling for so long. In his will Dad had asked to not be put on life support, so making the extremely hard decision on April 30th, I asked the nurse to help make him comfortable. I got to say my heartbreaking goodbyes via FaceTime since I could not physically be with him. An hour later Dad took his last breath and passed on.*********************************************************WHY A ""GOFUNDME"":Right after Dad passed, my amazing friend and roommate (Sierra B) went above and beyond to help drive me cross-country in 2 days to Terre Haute during the peak of COVID-19. For the last month my partner (Bobby L) and I have been in Indiana working on Dad's house-- sorting through medical bills and paperwork, packing up memories, cleaning up the house, taking care of the dogs, and getting Dad's estate set-up. It has been both emotionally and physically exhausting, especially doing this alone at age 26. We have now reached a point where we need to go back home to move forward with our jobs and home life.During this time we have come to find that Dad had almost no money or assets saved away, living paycheck to paycheck. He had borrowed from his pension earlier in life, so he has very little left to be passed along. Since he moved out here so recently there is very little equity on his house. His medical bills and debt are currently over $10,000. The estate is now only beginning to open up, and the process could take up to 9 months to end. Unfortunately this trip has been very expensive and has drained both Bobby and my checking and savings accounts. We have two dogs to transport back to Oregon, but no car or moving van to get us back. We will also not have enough time or money to attempt to move any of the wonderful memories and furniture back with us this time around.We are asking for help because we cannot do this alone. Dad's long time friend, Brian R, made a memorial post for Dad on FaceBook. After seeing all of the love and kindness pour in for my father from his friends who he brought smiles to, there were many people asking how they could help. Since we cannot do a memorial quite yet, we are asking for support. We hope to put together a BBQ and a celebration of life later this summer, or a virtual memorial for Dad at some point once we are back home.Bobby and I are hoping to leave within the next week or two to return back home. I know it is a short time frame, but every little bit will help us with our journey. Any amount raised over the goal will go towards keeping the pups, Milo and Sam, happy and healthy, and the eventual return trip to bring the memories and furniture back.We understand that these are uncertain times, but I know there are so many people who loved Dad and want to help. I wish to follow in my father's foot steps and move forward to cary on his legacy. Mo Loehmann was an amazing man, and the best father and hero a kid could ask for.

Thank you for your time, and best wishes to everyone!- Elizabeth LoehmannChild of Mo Loehmann, age 26

Hercules is a 6 year old Great Dane cross who we rescued when he was only 4 months old. Hercules came into our lives and stole all of our hearts. Herc has recently been diagnosed with Wobblers Syndrome which creates spinal cord compression in his neck. As a result of this Herc cannot go on his usual walks in the woods or play with other dogs like he used too; instead his paw bleeds as he walks because he drags it along the floor as a result of his condition, he can barely put any weight on his back right leg, he often falls over and struggles to hold his weight when he goes to the toilet.Treatment for Wobblers Syndrome is an operation which releases the compression from Herc’s neck. However, the operation and aftercare is very expensive. We pay full insurance for Hercules but after tests, CT scans and MRI’s our yearly allowance has been used up, meaning that we have very little left to put towards his operation. As a result of this Hercules is currently taking Metacam which will never cure or improve his condition. The other choice of medication will make Herc drowsy and ‘relaxed’ which is not what we want. We want Hercules to live. We have been told that with Hercules taking the medication we will never see an improvement, that we are basically providing palliative care unless he gets the operation. The thing about Wobblers is that it progresses quickly and one bad fall can lead to the worst situation imaginable.




We are hoping to raise £14,000 to cover the cost of the operation and rehabilitation. If, unfortunately we do not make enough money for the operation we will put it towards physio and donate the rest to the National Animal Welfare Trust where we rescued Hercules.Thank you to anyone who reads this, any donations are really appreciated.

At 29 years old, she was boldly making her mark in the Los Angeles theater world. Despite all that promise, just a short few weeks ago while in Colorado, Sofia unexpectedly suffered a hemorrhagic stroke due to an arteriovenous malformation in her brain stem. An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a cluster of abnormally formed blood vessels causing bleeding into the brain. Her medical team in Colorado have recommended radiosurgery to treat her AVM because her malformation is in an area that’s difficult to reach by regular surgery. She will undergo radiosurgery in August. AVMs occur in less than 1 percent of the general population and are typically not hereditary. So, in Sofia's case, it is simply a stroke of the worst luck possible (as if 2020 isn't the worst year ever already).If you know Sofia, you absolutely love her. She is the best friend, sister, and daughter you could ever have. Sofia is always one of the first to offer assistance and positivity to those in need. Now, she needs assistance from her large community of friends and family.Specifically, Sofia needs financial help from loved ones, friends and family to help her offset the medical costs for this extended ICU stay, 30 day in-patient rehabilitation, radiosurgery and then the ongoing outpatient rehabilitation. Please give what you can to help Sofia! Your generous contribution will go directly to Sofia to help her focus on her difficult recovery and not worry about her mounting hospital bills due to this unexpected medical crisis.Read more"

This hardworking attitude was what got him up for work every morning to support his family. His wife, Leah has been out of work and on disability for quite some time, due to long-term health problems. She had to leave a 21-year career as a nurse in the University of Maryland health care system. Due to this, we lost the benefits (insurance, etc.) her job provided. Subsequently, Jeff was the backbone to our family’s financial stability and caretaking.On Sunday, July 19th – Jeff was admitted to Baltimore Washington Medical Center, due to a stroke. The effects of the stroke have left him needing 24-hour care, and difficulties with swallowing, speaking, and mobility.Unfortunately, like so many other Americans, our family could not afford health insurance for him. The medical bills have begun to flood in and the loss of his income has caused many challenges. We (Jeff’s family) have started this Go Fund Me Campaign to help gather financial support for costs related to his hospital expenses, and ongoing care.The hospital care resulted in a 3-day stay in the ICU, with multiple tests and evaluations from specialists in all areas. Additionally, he needs in-home care and rehabilitation to regain strength. The rehabilitation period is critical in getting him back to a place of health and happiness. We have a long road ahead of us and it will take a lot of dedication from him, his family, and caregivers.Our family is asking for any donations and prayers you can provide to help us through this difficult time. Any amount, no matter how small will be very much appreciated. We thank you for your support and kindness!Read more"

My little brother, Anthony Bing, was in a terrible snowmobile accident on January 3, 2016, while we were sledding together in the back country. Sledding is his passion. It was nearing the end of an amazing day of sledding together with Mindy, his wife, myself, my 4 year old son, and our mother and father when this horrific nightmare happened. We had all been playing on the hills all day long, Anthony decided to go up one last time. The hill got a little steep and Anthony's sled came right over backwards, spun 180 degrees and the track of the snowmobile landed on his leg while the throttle was stuck wide open. The scratcher (a metal bar that digs in the snow) went through his boot and through his achilles tendon which stopped him from being able to pull his leg out. Meanwhile the back end of the track ripped through his clothing removed all the skin and tissue and into the muscle and tendons on the back side of his entire right leg. While the track was spinning at 70 mph it was cauterizing as it ate through his leg. He put his hand into the track to free his leg and shattered his hand. I was quickly at his side and able to get him down onto flat ground where I removed my clothes to make tourniquets to stop the bleeding. We called an ambulance and my amazingly tough in shock brother road out to the parking lot where the ambulance rushed him off to the Whistler Clinic. The clinic did triage on him and determined they could not do anything for him and then rushed him down to Vancouver General Hospital to the burn unit. He has suffered massive nerve damage to his leg and has next to zero feeling in his right leg. The pain killers and nerve pain killers are so strong that he is not able to focus on anything let alone type and ask for help. Watching him convulse in pain to the point of passing out for weeks on end is the worst thing that I have ever experienced and I pray that this kind of accident never happens to anybody ever again.Since being in the hospital he has had5 skin grafts for his ankle and his hamstring area on top of having a broken hand and massive internal nerve damage that can’t be seen.After the first skin graft the actual graft on his ankle was somehow removed during a bandage change and was never noticed until he was admitted at Lionsgate 10 days after his initial surgery.The transfer to Lionsgate was another fiasco in this nightmare. The doctors at VGH determined that Anthony was ready to go “home” about 5 days post surgery. Well, home to Fort St John wasn’t an option because of the lack of doctors and proper medical care for the injuries he had. So the hospital decided that he should go to Prince George. After Mindy and his mom did more extensive research into the medical care available in Prince George they learned that they too didn’t have the proper medical care for Anthony’s injuries. When they tried to talk to the VGH staff they were given the run around and basically told the hospital policy was to send him to the nearest hospital to his home town and that’s what they were doing. Well, in order to beat the system they changed Anthony’s legal address to his parents home in North Vancouver. VGH was then forced to either keep him there or transfer him to Lionsgate Hospital in North Vancouver. By keeping Anthony in the Vancouver area it allows for more family support and a two hour flight for his wife instead of a six hour drive to be able to visit when she can.Because there are no doctors in Fort St. John even when Anthony is allowed out of the hospital he will have to stay in the Vancouver area for more appointments with specialists and follow ups with surgeons. In order for him to attend each appointment he has to travel by ambulance which is not covered by BC medical.When the surgeon at Lionsgate did an initial assessment of Anthony’s injuries he noticed that there was nothing in the file about the damage to Anthony’s ankle area. They especially failed to mention that the skin graft hadn’t taken and that the actual skin around the achilles tendon was receding and festering thus making the wound much more significant and requiring immediate treatment in order for the best change of recovering movement and sensation in the area.After determining all of this, the surgeon then told us, the family, that there was nothing he could do because the two hospitals were fighting over the administrative side of who should be responsible for the costs to correct and continue to treat Anthony’s injuries. Another week went by of Anthony continuing to lay in a hospital bed in excruciating pain and feel as though his leg is rotting away a little more every day.It is now March 5, 2016 and he is still in the hospital for a minimum of one more month pending the last skin graft takes.Over the last 64 days we have learned also that his medical insurance doesn't cover his medications. When he was first admitted to the hospital the medications he was given turned into a massive allergic reaction which resulted in new meds that we later learned he is also allergic too. In the end the only meds that he can take without breaking into a rash from head to toe are not covered by BC Medical. The cost of these are over $1000 a week.That doesn’t include any of the future surgeries that he will have to have to fix the nerve damage along with countless nerve testing, years of physio and rehab and the medication for them as well. The doctors are saying that once he is out of the hospital he will have physio for a minimum of a year 4 to 5 times a week. With only 12 visits a year covered by medical, the bills will be huge.If the accident was not bad enough, Anthony and his wife’s financial situation is really struggling. Anthony runs a company in Fort St. John and since this was not a work related injury he is not being paid anymore. He qualifies for short term disability which is less than a grand every 2 weeks which doesn’t even cover the cost of his medication. His hospital room costs $200 a day as he requires a private room because his customized walker does not fit in the bathroom of a shared room but his injury for some reason does not qualify for a paid private room. This is something that shouldn’t even be an issue, because it is a requirement of his injuries. We have always been told that the hospital stay is covered by BC Medical. After receiving a bill for over $4,000 just for his stay at Lionsgate Hospital, Anthony and his wife found out the hard way, that isn’t true.On top of that, he has bills and amortgage like everybody else. Mindy has to be in Fort St John with their dogs and her job and can’t afford to come down and see her husband anymore than she already has.Due to the change in the economy in the oil and gas industry there is no guarantee there will be a company to return to once he is able. If he wasn’t beaten up enough physically, just imagine the mental deterioration and depression of not being able to provide for his family. My brother is one of my biggest inspirations in life. I have always looked up to him even though he is my little brother. He is a huge teddy bear underneath everything and has bent over backwards to help me over the years and would do the same for anyone in need and this is one of the reasons I find myself trying to help him, not because he is my brother but because he would do whatever he could for me or anyone else.If you can help in anyway even a little I know it would be appreciated and never forgotten.

In 2016 ben ik gediagnosticeerd met multiple sclerose. Ik was aan het werk, werd onwel en belandde met mijn werkbusje in het water. Na een lange periode van vele onderzoeken, kwam ik er achter dat ik leed aan MS. In 2016, I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. I was working, became unwell and ended up in the water with my work van. After a long period of many physical exams, I discovered that I had MS.Destijds zat ik nog in een revalidatiecentrum en was ik rolstoelafhankelijk. In de afgelopen jaren heb ik meerdere veranderingen in mijn leven aangebracht waardoor ik een betere grip heb op de ziekte. At the time I was still in a rehabilitation center and I was wheelchair dependent. In recent years, I have made several changes in my life that give me a better grip on the disease.Door voldoende te rusten en gezond(plantaardig) te eten kon ik mijn MS de afgelopen 4 jaar aardig onder controle houden. Door al deze veranderingen heb ik toch een beetje kunnen genieten van mijn opgroeiende zoon. Helaas is vermoeidheid en moeite met mijn grove motoriek nog altijd een probleem. By resting sufficiently and eating healthy (plant based) I was able to keep my MS under control for the past 4 years. All these changes have allowed me to enjoy my growing son a bit. Unfortunately, fatigue and difficulty with my gross motor skills is still a problem.In Nederland wordt MS behandeld met remmende medicatie die op langere termijn minder effect heeft. De aanbevolen behandeling tegen deze ziekte (RRMS) is een stamcel-behandeling. In the Netherlands, MS is treated with inhibiting medication that has less effect in the long term. The recommended treatment for this disease (RRMS) is stem cell treatment.Voor deze behandeling zal ik naar Panama moeten afreizen. De artsen in Panama hebben voor mij een behandelplan gemaakt dat helemaal is afgestemd op mijn situatie en ziektebeeld. Helaas wordt deze behandeling niet vergoed door mijn zorgverzekeraar. Ik wil daarom het geld inzamelen om deze behandeling te kunnen bekostigen. Dit hoeft niet overmorgen al voor elkaar te zijn (reizen is ook lastig tijdens de corona-periode) maar het liefst wel met enige spoed, aangezien ik lichamelijk achteruit blijf gaan.

I will have to travel to Panama for this treatment. The doctors in Panama have made a treatment plan for me that is completely tailored to my situation and clinical picture. Unfortunately, this treatment is not reimbursed by my health insurer. I therefore want to collect the money to pay for this treatment. This does not have to be done the day after tomorrow (travel is also difficult during the corona period), but preferably with some urgency, since I continue to deteriorate physically.Zonder deze behandeling zal ik in een korte tijd slecht ter been raken, weer rolstoelafhankelijk worden en uiteindelijk komen te overlijden aan de gevolgen van MS. Dit kan ik moeilijk accepteren. Ik wil er zijn voor mijn zoontje, mijn ouders en vrienden. Ik ben nog niet klaar met het leven en heb nog een heel veel in petto. Mocht iemand niet de financiële middelen hebben om mij te helpen dan zou ik ontzettend blij zijn als u dit bericht kunt delen met uw naasten of mij kunt helpen bij het opzetten van inzamelingsacties. Without this treatment I will have difficulty walking in a short time, become wheelchair dependent again and eventually die from the consequences of MS. I can hardly accept this. I want to be there for my son, my parents and friends. I'm not done with life yet and still have a lot in store. If someone does not have the financial resources to help me, I would be very happy if you can share this message with your loved ones or help me set up fundraisers.Elke euro komt goed terecht. Help mij deze ziekte te verslaan!

Every euro ends up well. Help me beat this disease!

Elon Aaron is a fighter. He is typically very strong-willed and normally has a strong pain threshold, however, his most recent 10-hour spine surgery he underwent was one of the most physical and mentally draining “adventures” he has ever encountered or experienced. Elon suffers from systemic severearthritis/stenosis that came about suddenly turning his youthful 37-year-old body into that of an 80-year-old man. Several discs were fused, artificial disks implanted, and realignment of his cervical spine and neck curvature. Out of seven surgeons seen, not one of them was able to give him a definitive answer as to how this all started. He is extremely fortunate that he had the surgery when he did because his surgeons commented that he was only a couple of months away from suffering from major paralysis. Elon thanks God every day for the blessings of still being able to function and get around without the use of a wheelchair.


Surgery was completed on August 27th accompanied by a 5-day hospital stay. As it stands now he is still extremely worried about the inability to swallow at times. This, along with his excruciating pain had brought him back into ER.

Since 9/23 he has been back in the ER three times in four days for not being able to swallow. He’s scheduled to soon be getting an endoscopy to see exactly what’s going on with this very scary and painful situation. It appears that there is too much excess fluid building up in his system due to his surgery which prohibits him from even swallowing his own spit. Food and water is almost impossible. He will have an update within the next week or so. Four different surgeons/doctors are simultaneously overseeing his health so that something even more devastating does not happen.Elon is in dire need of financial support as the majority of needed specialists he is having to see for treatment not covered by his insurance. Even with insurance, his co-pays are brutal. Due to not being able to work, paying health bills out of pocket, and recently totaling car caused him to clear out his entire savings. Your donation will help with his survival and rehabilitation, gain physical and financial independence, and hopefully, be able to start a fresh life going forward. Elon is very aware of the struggle that everyone is going through in this awful year and the environmental issues on the West Coast, and he’d be out there in the trenches helping others if he could, but his circumstances sadly put him on the “needing” side at this time in his life.caption: Henry Winkler and Elon on setcaption: Elon with Ákila ArcanjoHis close personal and work friends are doing all they can and going the extra mile to help Elon because they know first-hand what he stands for as a human and love him for it. He has unconditional respect for everyone he meets and will go out of his way to help when needed and we would like to reciprocate that favor in this painful and challenging time.Elon's professional career has been quite varied and unique. For almost a decade he has lent his talents in film and tv Location Management as an esteemed scout/location manager for productions, in music videos, features, and commercials. This job has taken him around the country, sometimes putting him in some beautiful locations and crossing paths with many well-known directors and stars in the entertainment industry. He feels very blessed to be able to work in an atmosphere of such great camaraderie and kinship.caption: Life Vest Inside Team Elon used to volunteer. Photo includes CEO Orly WahbaIn addition to his challenging work in the ""movie business"", Elon has extensive event/promotion/concert coordination experience and dedicated his life and thousands of hours spearheading the position of Volunteer Director of Strategic Operations for an international “kindness” organization assisting the CEO to bring it to life. Along with CEO Orly Wahba, he not only helped strategize different methods of fundraising, he also spearheaded a choreographed freeze/flash dance mob harboring over 50,000 participants plus placing musicians and post-production engineers to make it the best sounding experience possible. Here is an example of these ventures:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sJLzJoQH6ocaption: When Elon was an advisor for a delegation for CA. Youth and GovernmentElon has also dedicated an exorbitant amount of time as a volunteer for an incredible “A-political” organization called Youth And Government -spearheading groups that taught empathy for one another politically and helping facilitate the legislative structure when in the capital building. Here is a link for that specific organization so you can visibly see, how powerful this isORGANIZATION WEBSITE: https://www.calymca.org/caption: LVI teamElon has always been in the emotional position to help others and always without reciprocation expected. This is the main reason that he feels uncomfortable asking for help for this himself, and why I am personally involved, My focus is to help him cover the extraordinary costs and on-going medical care so we can give him his life back. I understand that this is a very difficult time for most of us but would greatly appreciate any donation that you could extend this young man, even if it's just $5.00. caption: Len May and Ian LancasterAny amount will help, and I thank you in advance for all you can do... if you're not able to financially help him at this time a sincere word of encouragement is a priceless commodity in these times and it will go a long way to help him emotionally and feel that he's not alone in the fight of his life to survive, strive, and move forward.caption: Elon at a wedding 10 years ago.Elon said to me one day that “I yearn for the day I am “normal once again”. I wish this type of pain and agony on NO ONE.” From a friend’s perspective, this was hard to see and hear. ANY help at this moment would mean the world to Elon and I know how grateful he will be. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.CHARACTER REFERENCES From Elon - ""I’m blessed to state that all of these references below are written in their own words and genuine. I had zero input to do with what was stated or how they stated it.""Ossey J. – Close business associate/Producer / 10+ year friend“If there were ever a guy who wanted the best for a person, it’s Elon. Elon and I met about 19 years ago in the music scene in Los Angeles. Immediately we were able to spark you a natural and genuinely friendly conversation which also translated well into his business talents. Elon is the definition of “go getter”. I had made a post on Facebook looking for a filming location on Facebook and before you knew it, Elon had already come through with a location within hours. For this I offered him $100. He said, “my only stipulation for helping you is not money, but that we can sit down for a coffee and talk about what you do as a location manager. It’s very interesting and I’d like to know more about it.” I agreed. Later on that same week Elon and I met for coffee. We ended up speaking on all matters of life for hours. The things this man has been through would possibly make anyone lose their edge. Not Elon, he was friendly and open the entire time and mentioned how he too would like to become a location manager and name in the film industry, as he very often has incredibly creative ideas both for business and story. I warned him about how stressful the job can be and also how difficult it can be at times. All the weight of the production lies on you. Elon wasn’t phased at all and raised the stakes and said that he would not only learn to be great at this, but he would make it into the Teamster Union within a year's time. This greatly intrigued me so I accepted. From that moment on for the last 10 years, Elon has met his goals. He became a union locations manager, he did it in a year. Not to mention he worked his way up to network television shows and successfully managed himself and others.To say Elon is a good businessman is an understatement, he is an extraordinarily hard worker but most of all he has been a good reliable friend. Sometimes sharing his last dollars for us to have a meal, fighting for MY rights, and what I deserved as a location manager, even more than I fought for my own. He truly is the definition of a great friend and an inspiration.Which brings to us this unfortunate mishap that he is going through. He is one of the last people on earth who deserves to have his life and career taken away from him, live and breathe in excruciating pain for reasons beyond his control. I know if the roles were reversed Elon would be there for me in a second and at this time. He really needs us to be there for him. Donating money to Elon’s recovery and medical expenses is not just a donation. It’s an investment into sustaining a person that will continue to uplift your life, your perspective and most of all, be there for you when not another person will. Please lend to this whatever you can spare for this man. Of all the causes that people post for, this is one that makes lives better and gives to a much deserving person, a second chance to continue doing what he loves. Connecting people and helping people.”Steve H. - Business owner of Chili Johns/ close friend“Elon Aaron is an extremely professional and trustworthy individual. Proclaiming someone trustworthy is not something I take lightly or do without merit. In Elon’s case, it is definitely not under warranted. Elon is extremely hard-working, and once given a task, he emphatically works feverishly and un-dauntingly to accomplish it promptly and with surgical like precision. All that being said most importantly, I am proud to be privileged enough to call Elon a true and loyal friend and highly trusted business advisor.He has guided and helped nurture several productions and is an invaluable asset to our family restaurant named Chili John’s. He personally has secured over five productions which only made us better and more desirable as a location. We can not thank him enough for his work and dedication so far(often donating his time) We look forward to continuing this partnership in collaboration with him for years to come.Elon has recently fallen on hard times medically, physically, and emotionally as well as financially and is well-deserving of any assistance available in order to enable and support his personal, physical, emotional, and financial recovery...:""Orly Wahba- Friend“I met Elon some years ago as he reached out excited and enthusiastic to offer his time to help my non-profit, Life Vest Inside. It was clear to tell from the get-go that he has a great heart and was wanting to lend a hand in any way he can. As a result of his medical issues, he has and is accruing significant medical bills. Elon isn’t one to reach out for help unless he really needs it. And so when he reached out and shared the hardships he is facing and asked for my help - of course, I said yes!Please contribute whatever you can to help Elon get back to better:) In today’s day and age, we all could use a bit of help every now and then. When we offer a lending hand it is never wasted.”Christian A. L. – Business associate/ Friend“Since encountering Elon, he has been both a valuable asset and a man who has constantly grounded me and my ethics. He stands ferociously with taking the right option over the easy one and has always pledged himself to just causes. Like Musk, Elon has a refreshing drive about him to seek out and go out of his way for futuristic efforts, as well as noble causes which he believes in. This is a quality that is hard to find in the business world and goes to show how strong his character is. From the time I have spent working with Elon, it is clear to me that he is not only a reliable partner, but he deserves to belong in technology. People like him improve the lives of many without question.”Nathin B. - Business associate/ Friend“Elon Aaron is one of the most honest, trustworthy, and hard-working gentlemen you’ll ever meet. When faced with adversity, he continues to strive to succeed in the ever-evolving entertainment industry. You’re an inspiration to us all mate!”Rachel A. – Friend of 20+ years“I’ve known Elon since I was 16. He is a passionate soul and has one of the biggest hearts I know. He always tries to bring joy to others and is compassionate as can be. We don’t always see eye to eye but regardless of our differences, we never let that get in the way of our 20 plus years of friendship. His willingness to drop whatever he is doing and makes a point to be there when times are rough. Elon is a sweetheart and I consider myself fortunate to have him in my life”Jehnean W.- business associate / Friend“I have known Elon Aaron since 2015. We have worked together on getting my film put together. His passion and drive were evident as he envisioned making the project a success. He has worked solidly as a location manager and scout in the entertainment industry for a few years on much high profile film and television productions. I have seen his work habits and they are not only focused but driven to excellence. When he takes on a project he commits 100 % in till his job is finished and shines. He diligently pursues his goals and always does it with a heartwarming smile” He strongly deserves our assistanceRicardo R. – Security Gaffer / Close Friend“I have known Elon for about 6 years now. He is one of the most humble/ great people I have known and / or worked with. He always goes out of his way to help you any way possible out of the goodness of his heart even if he does not like you. I’ve seen that first hand. I first met Elon as a location manager and after years of knowing him, he has become an intricate part of my life. I have personally witnessed Elon go to great lengths to help multiple people “just because”. A friend/business associate like Elon is hard to come by. He truly loves what he does and it shows. Even if he is in a bad mood he always has a smile on his face to make sure others are at ease. Especially in the production world, people come and go, but very few stay to make sure “you” are doing ok as a human. Elon is one of those that has giving a lot to the community. Not many are made to handle the industry and life in general, but Elon has and will”Josh L. - Close Friend""Elon is a good man that stands for his convictions and is not one to ask for help. Throughout the many years of our friendship, he has always been a voice of reason to many of my struggles I expressed to him. He has gone out of his way to help even when not asked. This man has always been a supportive friend that has no qualms about using his time and energy to help a friend in need. Now he needs our help financially in his time of need. I hope that those reading this will offer some aid because we all know he deserves it. No matter his struggles you will never see him without a smile on his face to make sure others are happy. I know he has been in significant pain and distress over this last year which he’s stated himself “I wish this on no one, not even my own worst enemy”. He is one of those people that is worth helping even if all you can give is a small donation to the preservation of his life and well-being. His struggles are harsh and deserves solace.""YOU CAN DO IT ELON!-Sheri DavisRead more"

Thank you to everyone who donated. I am behind sending out thank you messages but I will work on that on Saturday when I’m at the hospital visiting Ben. I will also include the latest on his recovery. I increased the goal of this campaign as John and I are learning more about what the costs will be for Ben to fully recover. It’s been amazing at all the people who have reached out one way or another. I have an amazing group of friends that truly care about Ben. I tell Ben about the outpouring of love and I read some of the messages I receive. I swear he even tries to smile at times. Or it could be gas. He smiles at that too . I will continue to share his progress and update this page as I see fit. Thank you to everyone. I am blessed. 

 On December 3rd Benjamin lost control of his motorcycle (he just got it back from the repair shop) and crashed at a high rate of speed into the side of the road. His helmet came off and left his head unprotected. We estimate he flew approximately 35 feet into the field next to the road. He fractured his eye socket, broke 3 bones in his hand and a bone above his elbow. He also incurred a brain bleed and swelling of the brain. He has been on a ventilator and sedated for 10 days now. He is scheduled to get a tracheotomy this weekend so we can remove the ventilator. After he is set with the tracheotomy he will be transported to a rehabilitation hospital. (Craig in Englewood Colorado). There he will begin an intensive program to re-learn how to walk, talk, eat etc. It is vital that he begins therapy sooner than later so that he may be given the best opportunities to fully gain back his motor skills and most of his cognitive abilities. This will be a long process. We are told that where he is after 12 months will be the highest level he will gain. Therefore more reason to begin as soon as we can. Craig is considered one of, if not the, best rehabilitation hospitals in the country. We are fortunate to live within an hour of it. We will apply for family housing while Ben is there. We are not sure if we qualify at this time. They also allow dogs to visit so that will be good for his recovery as Walter and Jesse love Ben a ton! 

Right now we aren’t sure what our out of pocket costs will be but we know that we are not in a position to comfortably cover all the costs. We are hoping to get the best care for Ben as we believe that he will make a full recovery if he is given that opportunity. I will probably not be able to work a lot this coming year in order to be available for Ben. He will be my priority from this point on. Thank you for all the kind messages, meals, and support I’ve received thus far. I have an amazing community of friends and equestrians reaching out to help. This will be an ongoing fundraiser. Thank you in advance. Read more"

My name is Erik Bentley (I go by Bentley) and I have started this GoFundMe in order to have reconstructive jaw surgery. 

On June 12th in Denver Colorado I was jumped by three White Men who assaulted me and called me racial slurs like Ni**er and broke my jaw in three places, specifically, my mandible. At the time of me writing this, I have already been to the ER and been given temporary relief and treatment. I currently have my bottom jaw partial wired, my lower teeth wired together, and have had my jaw adjusted. On June 22nd I will be undertaking an outpatient procedure in order to get my jaw reconstructed. They will be installing two plates and multiple screws. My recovery time will be 6-8 weeks, and in that time I will not be able to chew as I heal so I will be restricted to a liquid diet. 

I've been blessed to be able to walk away from the assault with my life, and I'm hoping I'll be able to be blessed again. I currently don't have insurance, and after Medicaid/Hospital Discounts, an $80,000+ bill has been reduced to $31,000. I am grateful that amount has been lowered, however I have been unemployed since the beginning of March due to the pandemic, and have not qualified for Colorado unemployment due to me moving in December '19 and not making enough to be reimbursed.

With this money I'm hoping to have my entire bill covered, as well as be able to provide myself with food and rehabilitation tools. I understand the world is going through a global pandemic, and domestically we are fighting for the lives and rights of Black People and POC here in America, but on a personal level, I'm fighting for my life. I'm fighting to return to normalcy. I'm fighting to restore my voice so I can speak out against vile and heinous actions like the one perpetrated against me. I'm fighting to be able to smile again.

I again thank you for your time visiting my fundraiser, and ask humbly and with full humility, to please donate to help restore my jaw, my dignity, and my life.

Keep each other safe and loved,

Because Jeff wasn't married with any family and wasn't working for the last two years due to his strokes, we would appreciate any donations to help defray the funeral costs in lieu of cards and/or flowers.On March 4, 2016, our son and brother, Jeff Harbuck, attended a religious conference in Brooksville, Florida, that he had been looking forward to for some time. Others at the conference who’d always known Jeff to be very engaging, friendly, and talkative, noticed he was not his normal, outgoing self. He was usually one to sit toward the front of the room and actively participate in discussions, but this weekend, Jeff was seen sitting in the back of the room appearing to fall asleep. His odd absence was also noted at meal times, as well.At the end of the conference, Jeff miraculously managed to make the 6 hour drive home to Daphne, Alabama, where he resides with and helps take care of his elderly mother, Lizanne Harbuck. Upon Jeff’s return, he entered the house, told Lizanne that he was completely exhausted, and went to bed where he ended up sleeping for nearly 24 hours.On Tuesday, when Jeff finally emerged from his room, Lizanne noticed he seemed dazed and confused and said he was dizzy with ringing in his ears. He had difficulty speaking clearly and bumped into the wall several times. Concerned for her son’s health, she drove him to the emergency room in Mobile. The doctors were baffled by his symptoms and unsure what to do. He was admitted and treated with antibiotics. By Thursday, Jeff was continuing to slur his speech and make no sense. He seemed disoriented and angry and began fighting the medical staff, pulling out his leads, and trying to get out of his hospital bed. For his own safety and to aid in his healing, his hands were mitted and he was put in a four-point restraint. His vital signs were off the chart—not in good directions—and there was concern for his heart and his kidneys. His blood pressure had skyrocketed to 300 over 212 at one point.To make matters worse, Jeff’s kidneys began to fail him. He was swollen and bloated from excessive fluids and for all of these reasons, the medical staff felt it was to his advantage to intubate and sedate him to give his body a chance to heal while they decided what was going on. Everything was going downhill and Jeff showed no signs of improvement.Believing he might not make it through the next 24 hours, Jeff’s uncle, who is a retired physician, and his younger sister made a 10 hour drive from their homes in Savannahto Mobile perhaps see Jeff for the last time. Once they arrived, they saw a brother and nephew they did not recognize. His condition was termed “critical” and “dire” by the medical staff and it was unclear if he could come through this.Through what can only be described as a casebook example of the awesome power of prayer—especially the many prayers from around the country and around the world flooding in—Jeff not only survived through the night, but his condition had greatly improved the following morning. They started dialysis on his kidneys and it appeared to be greatly helping. It was as if the rain clouds had stopped, separated, and a rainbow of hope was shining through. A state away, Jeff’s older sister encountered a rainbow in a rain-free sky as she arrived at work and we all took it as a sign.Days passed, blood and toxicology tests were performed to rule out anything and everything. Finally, the doctor told Lizanne that Jeff had contracted pneumonia while in the hospital. While he expected him to make a full recovery from the pneumonia—albeit a long one—they still were unsure as to what brought Jeff into the hospital.CT scans were performed and compared to the ones taken when he first arrived in the ER. As the days passed, more dialysis was administered, and Jeff remained in a sedated, intubated, and restrained state. At times when the sedation was changed, his eyes would flutter open, but there seemed to be no recognition of people or his surroundings. After several more days of sedation, dialysis, and aggressive antibiotics, it became apparent there were other, deeper underlying issues.Finally, another CT scan revealed that Jeff has suffered from a stroke. More tests are needed to determine the severity and extent of any possible brain damage. As of Thursday, March 24, he is now breathing on his own without the tube, but is still unable to speak or make clear sense of his surroundings. He has been able to respond to verbal cues by blinking his eyes and we have faith that he will be able to rebound from this—although it will be a long rehabilitation process. We are that any brain damage will be minimal, but it is too early to know for sure.This ordeal has been extremely taxing and stressful to Jeff’s family, but especially to his mother, Lizanne. Since losing her husband in 2014, Lizanne has relied on Jeff as her in-home caregiver and has depended on him for financial assistance. With Jeff hospitalized indefinitely and facing an extended recovery, 100% of the financial burden is now on Lizanne who is on a fixed income living off a monthly social security check.That’s why we, Jeff’s family, have started this crowd sourcing campaign… to help raise funds to make up for the loss of Jeff’s income, to ease some of the financial burden for Jeff’s mother.Lizanne has shown amazing resilience and strength throughout this ordeal, but at 82 years of age and only employed part-time as a church organist, she is not prepared to suddenly absorb this immediate, unplanned, and possibly ongoing financial shortfall.We are praying for a full, speedy recovery for Jeff, but we are also being cautiously optimistic.With the power of everyone’s continued prayers, we are hoping for a miracle.In the meantime, Lizanne sure could use your help. She’s under an enormous amount of stress with Jeff’s hospitalization and is now facing a very uncertain future in terms of his lengthy recovery and not knowing if he will ever be able to return to work. If you know Jeff, then you know how important Lizanne is in his life and how much he loves her. We’ve made it a top priority every day he has been in the hospital to let him know that she is fine and is being taken care of… that he has to focus on himself, on getting better. But, she needs outside financial assistance at this time.Please contribute in any way you can. Jeff would certainly appreciate it and be eternally grateful. Please share this message with others and help us keep the vigil for Jeff’s recovery going strong. We will be sure to keep you all posted with regular updates on Jeff’s condition as we have them.Thank you for for contributing, and please keep Jeff and his family—especially Lizanne—in your prayers.MAY GOD BLESS EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU!Read more"

My brother and his family couldn’t have been more excited to come see us and meet their new nephew and cousin. Matter of fact, so anxious that they decided to leave in the evening after a long hard day at work so they could capitalize on every second that weekend to spend with us. They packed up not knowing that their and our lives would never be the same. That evening, my brother plowed his way through the darkness of the night making his way towards us on their long journey. A journey that would change him for the rest of his life. He began to hear loud noises in the car, thinking of mechanical problems and fearing for his family’s safety, he steered the vehicle to the side of the road as the vehicle lost power. Upon the shining of the light from his wife’s cell phone, it was apparent that there were no mechanical issues but merely gunshot rounds that rang into the vehicle. At that point, they realized my brother had been shot and lost feeling from his chest down. He was rushed to the hospital while his family was left behind in shambles. Now, as he lays in a hospital bed paralyzed from his chest down, we are all trying to pick up the pieces and grasp to hope that he may return to some type of normal. A new normal without the use of his legs.It’s a long road ahead. Hospital bills, lengthy rehabilitation, home modifications, vehicle modifications, loss of the ability to work and family care for the foreseeable future.

He never asked for this, provoked this, nor deserved this. He’s an incredible Father, a devout husband, and a loyal brother and friend. 

Please help us bring him a new sense of normal with your donation. One where he can put this horrific past behind him and focus on a new normal.

God bless you and your hearts for your donations towards that next step!

Unfortunately his treatment is not covered by any insurance we currently have, so it's our responsibility to pay for it. Please help our dad receive his treatment so he can go back to putting a smile on everyones face!It all started in 2010 when his daughters were just 11, 9, & 8 years old. He was rushed to the hospital after experiencing excruciating headaches where he was told that he had a brain tumour the size of a golf ball. At first the doctor believed it to be an aneurysm, but later they determined it to be a brain tumour that had ruptured. The doctor thought our dad wouldn't survive, and asked our mom to immediately bring their daughters to say their goodbyes to him, because he thought there was no hope and he would die. Our mom said no thank you and forced the doctor to refer brain surgeons to them because she was confident that our dad would survive this. Seven surgeons wouldn't operate on him because they all thought he wouldn't make it. Finally, an angel surgeon on vacation, viewed our dad's X-Ray photos and told our mom, ""I am going to save your husband."" He saved him, after that during the course of 10 years, he had to go through extensive radiation therapy in order to restrict the growth of the tumour.Then in 2019, the tumour became aggressive and had to be operated on. He had emergency surgery during March Break, and the staff miraculously removed the very large tumour in almost its entirety. However, our dad suffered a stroke during the removal which left him paralyzed from his entire left side. For the next six weeks he was in rehabilitation, continuously working with physical and occupational therapists to get him back to his old self. It was a long journey, but a year later, he's able to walk and work, while continuing to get to 100%!A year later, after multiple MRI's and CAT scans, the doctors have discovered that his disease has progressed to his liver and lungs, resulting in a metastasis. In order for him to be cured, immunotherapy is the only treatment available to him at this time. All his radiation options has been exhausted, and since this is a very costly treatment, we need your help. With your generous donations, our family can achieve our goal, and support our dad through these trying times!This is an ongoing treatment, and we are unsure as to how long it will be. It is all based on the tumours reaction to the medication.Please, share our family's journey so that as many people can help. Remember, no donation is too small, we are grateful for anything you can contribute that can help save our dad!Read more"

On the 24th of June 2016, precious Poppy Mernagh aged just 2 and a half years old, daughter of Jennifer Tymlin and Edward Mernagh, from Rathnew, Co. Wicklow, was struck down by the entreovirus and pneumonia which then manifested into something much more severe, a condition called Transverse Myelitis, which only affects 1 in 800,000. 
Transverse Myelitis is inflammation of the spinal cord. This inflammation causes damage to the nerve fibres that may be irreversible. Poppy is currently in ICU in Temple Street undergoing treatment to try and reduce the inflammation, but unfortunately the treatment is not as successful as we would like. Poppy's current condition is not good, she is paralysed from the chin down and is unable to breathe by herself and until the inflammation has gone down the Doctors cannot determine weather the damage is permanent or not. Poppy has also been diagnosed with Non Polio Acute Flaccid Paralysis which was caused by the Transverse Myelitis. 
Poppy has a long road of treatment and recovery ahead with a minimum stay of 6 months in Temple Street followed by further recovery in a rehabilitation centre. 
We have set up this page to try and relieve the financial burden on Jen, Ed and Poppy's family at this devastating time. 
Life has to continue and the cost of travelling to and from the hospital, parking, food, hospital accommodation and the regular household bills all need to be covered! Due to Poppy's hospitalisation, Jen has had to cease employment to be with Poppy. 
Any donation is greatly appreciated.

For many years she has suffered from mental health difficulties, including severe depression, anxiety and psychosis. She has reached out for help from the National Health Service countless times, but their mental health system failed her repeatedly, leaving her unsupported despite desperately wanting and needing medical aid. This ultimately led her to feel like the only way to end her pain was to end her life.I’m Blue’s partner, Joe, and the reason I’m asking for your help urgently is because on Thursday Blue will likely be forced back into an NHS facility which detains mentally ill people. I cannot speak for all psychiatric wards, but the one she will be held on is awful. She doesn’t have a choice of a different ward, and her previous stays there have left her feeling worse. During her last stay, Blue witnessed a member of staff slap a patient across the face. Blue was also forced to sleep without a pillow in a freezing room without curtains on the window. She was shouted at and shaken for crying. She had no access to any therapy, and no rehabilitation help. She was trapped with no outside space, no mobile phone, and almost no organised activities. For food, she was given only baked potatoes and beans for 7 meals in a row. Staff would belittle patients and ignore their basic rights. Blue’s ward doctor (who she could see only once a week) was aggressive and uncompassionate; we later learned he had been found guilty of contributing to the death of a patient under his care on the ward, yet he still works there.To top it off, the official CQC Inspection Report declared this facility failed at both meeting the standard of ensuring patients are treated with respect, and at giving patients safe and appropriate care that meets their needs and supports their rights.Does this sound like a place someone seriously ill can recover in?I can’t leave our beautiful Blue there again. After her suicide attempt, I’m desperate to keep her safe and cared for properly.I know Blue has brought many of you so much joy through her amazing art and writing, and I know it’s not only me who wants to help her. And so, I made this fundraiser so that everyone who wants to support her is able to. Let’s help her together! #WeLoveYouDestinyBlueEvery penny of your generous donations will go on securing Blue a bed in a private mental health hospital where she can truly recover. Hopefully it will be at The Nightingale Hospital near her home in London, as Blue has stayed here before. Last October, she admitted herself for as long as she could – three nights. She improved even over this short time. With access to intensive psychotherapy, group sessions, great facilities, and regular doctor reviews, she was actively engaged and made a lot of progress. But three days were not enough.As Blue has complex and on-going difficulties, her doctor is recommending an inpatient stay of eight weeks minimum, although she might need longer to stabilise, find the right medication, and rehabilitate more fully.Unfortunately, private healthcare is expensive, with fees for The Nightingale Hospital totaling almost £800 a day (for reference, it costs the NHS around £500 per patient per day to house people on that awful ward). We hope to give Blue the eight-week recommended stay, but even if we raise only enough for a few days it will still be a huge help in the short term, so every donation makes a difference!If by some wonder of your generosity we exceed our goal, any extra funds will be spent on Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) therapy for Blue, which has shown to be an effective treatment for depression, but is unavailable on the National Health Service.For those who don’t know her, my partner is an artist known as DestinyBlue, who’s unique, colourful and emotional artwork has touched so many so deeply. She is outspoken and honest about her mental health struggles, being nominated Mind the mental health charity ‘Digital Champion’ award for her work and activism, and also being chosen by Instagram to be an Official Art Ambassador for them.For those of us who know her in real life, we know how her inner glow lights up everyone around her, how she can make you laugh even when she’s feeling down, and how she’s even more incredible, wise, and generous than any online profile could show. But you can get a taste of how wonderful she and her artwork are here:Facebook | Instagram | DeviantArt | TwitterAnd we can help her together. Let's put some magic back in her life!Thank you for reading.Thank you doubly for sharing.Thank you eternally for donating.Sending Peace, Love, Gratitude, Spoons, and more Love.Joe – Blue’s Partner

[If you are having difficulty with suicidal feelings, you are not alone. Anyone can struggle – from someone as amazing as Blue, to someone as amazing as you. Please reach out for support to friends and family, or to your local suicide hotline: http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html. I have spoken much about the failings Blue has encountered with the NHS, but please do not let this discourage you from seeking help. Many of the problems we have come across are due to her local facilities not being adequate, but many places offer better support. We have still met some incredible people working in mental health who genuinely care, and are worth their weight in gold. These people are ready and wanting to help you.]

Blue is now recovering in hospital all thanks to you generosity.

She is already feeling an improvement in her mood and metal state.

She's sending huge thanks all of you. I am too. Thank you for keeping my partner safe. I can't tell you enough how much this means to me.

We currently have raised enough to cover 6 weeks treatment on the ward. This will certainly be enough to start giving Blue the time she deserves to get better. We may be able to raise more thorough the weeks of her being there. But certainly we can rest easy knowing shes safe thanks to you.While her primary objective is to stabilize her mental health, she will be keeping you updated on her social media, and I'll be keeping you updated here.Thank You,Joe

I introduced you all to Tyrus last week during a War Horse Athlete spotlight. To give you some more background on him, he and I served in the Marines together at 1st Bn 3rd Marines. As I was finding my own way as a newly arrived Infantry Officer, Tyrus quickly demonstrated himself to be the Marine that every new Officer wants in his platoon. Extremely intelligent, hard working, an example to his peers, and loyal to a fault. Having this man as a Team Leader, my attached at-the-hip Radio Operator, and eventually Squad Leader are some of my better memories from the Marine Corps. He helped me while we sweat in Okinawan Jungles and Desert Heat, froze in cold tundra, and got soaked in uncountable days of rain. Our friendship continued after we both exited the Marine Corps and I was not surprised when he started to successfully establish himself within the Wildland Fire community. He has a passion for life and helping others that is infectious and inspires others to be better.While road tripping from Seattle to Las Vegas with his fiancee, Savannah, and their three dogs, Tyrus was involved in a very serious accident. After 9+ hours of driving, they decided to pull over to get some sleep in Northern Nevada.The following morning, April 5th, 2020 they awoke to find a hot spring near the van. Their van had gotten stuck in the mud, and while their attention was focused on trying to get it out, their dogs, Odin and Banjo, jumped in to the hot spring and were crying for help. Tyrus being the man and dog lover he is, immediately ran in to the hot spring to save the dogs. What he didn't know at the time was that this particular hot springs temperature was about 180 degrees.The hot spring left Tyrus with extremely severe 2nd and 3rd degree burns on the lower half of his body. He was left in agonizing physical and emotional pain after experiencing the tragic death of his dog, Banjo, and his best friends dog, Odin. This added to the already serious blistering injuries from the hot spring.They were eventually able to gain service and call 911. After about 45 minutes on the phone with dispatch, the Helicopter finally arrived to the scene. He was then transported to a small airport, loaded aboard a plane and airlifted to the University of Utah Burn Unit, where he is currently receiving medical attention.Re-learning how to walk will be the first order of business after he sufficiently recovers from his surgeries.He and I have been in contact throughout the whole process and, typical Tyrus, he almost non-stop refuses to worry about himself. Voicing his concern and care for friends and family as he himself has just undergone an aggressive skin graft surgery schedule and is just starting the rehab process.He is well aware of the long road ahead of him (about a year estimated of physical recovery). During this time Tyrus and I have discussed ways he can continue to find purpose and give back to the community that cares about him. We will be doing intermittent updates on his physical recovery, and more importantly, the mental lessons he is learning and applying during this incredibly difficult time. Our goal is that if you or a loved one ever finds themselves in a similar scenario (we hope you don’t), you can use the lessons learned from Tyrus’s experience to mentally prepare and succeed in those trying times. Tyrus is as tough as they come, and I have no doubt his mentality will be inspiring to you all. Due to him having just left his previous job to make the journey to his new position on a Helitak Fire Crew, he was uninsured during the time of the accident, and as a result, will have medical bills estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands. When I told him about this idea his FIRST reaction was how HE could pay ME back. That’s just the kind of man Tyrus is. Whatever amount you can spare to financially support Tyrus during this life changing time is greatly appreciated by myself, Tyrus, his family and loved ones, and the entire Veteran / Fire / and War Horse community.Read more"

Luckily the artery wasn’t hit but the round splintered her bone into 4 pieces which required immediate surgery. The surgery involved putting a rod down into her bone and securing it with 2 screws near her knee and a bolt near her hip. After nearly a month in the hospital and rehabilitation center she was sent home with an unknown prognosis for returning to her job or even walking normal again. After months of physical therapy and multiple trips to see the surgeon it was decided the bone wasn’t healing right and another surgery was performed, removing all the existing hardware, replacing it, and doing a bone graft using bone from her pelvis. She is once again home, still only able to walk with a crutch and not able to drive. Throughout this entire ordeal she has had to cope with not being able to do even simple activities with her family, the constant pain, fear of her unknown future, and the mounting financial stress. In her spare time Marcie works with the Shenandoah Shepherd Rescue and Virginia German Shepherd Rescue as a foster and she has had to completely eliminate that portion of her life for now and unforeseen future. She loves working with the rescues and desperately wants to get back to a place where that is possible.Her biggest fear is not being able to return to her job as a sheriff’s deputy.

Luckily, the first responders got to him quickly. He was rushed to Lawrence Memorial Hospital, where he was stabilized. They tried to Medflight him to Boston, but could not because of the weather. Instead they took him by ambulance to Tufts New England Medical Center. He spent 3 weeks in the critical care and intensive care units, undergoing many tests and procedures, including brain surgery to relieve the pressure in his skull and placement of a feeding tube. The first few days he was on a ventilator and unconscious and it was not clear if he would survive. He gradually regained consciousness and the ventilator was removed. He initially could only communicate with hand gestures, but eventually was able to speak. It was wonderful to hear his voice (even if a bit muffled)! His ability to communicate was also the first sign that the stroke did not impair his cognition. Unfortunately, he had almost complete paralysis on his left side.On December 10th, he was moved to the Northeast Rehabilitation Hospital in Salem, NH. Since arriving and starting physical, occupational, and speech therapy, he has made remarkable progress! He has regained some of his strength and is able to sit in a chair and chat. He can partially move his left leg and some of his fingers in his left hand. With a lot of assistance, he can also take a few steps! These are all things that seemed improbable just several weeks ago. Rick has received great medical care and through it all Kristine has been by his side. She has taken weeks off from her job as a therapist to be with him. This devotion has helped Rick focus on getting better and getting home. Unfortunately, their income has suffered. In addition, there have been numerous expenses related to Rick’s hospital and rehab stays, and there will be many future expenses once Rick returns home, including modifications to the house. It is not clear when Rick will return to work. Anything you can donate to help Rick, Kristine, and Justin will be most appreciated! It will go to paying for Rick’s care. Thank you so much!

On August 9th, while my brother Daniel was on a weekend trip in Lake Sunapee with his friends from Syracuse University, he suffered a tragic injury to his dominant right hand after a wake boarding accident. He was quickly airlifted to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery on his hand. Fortunately, the surgeons were able to save his thumb and protect his wound on his palm from becoming infected, however Daniel is left without his four fingers on his right hand. He underwent a second surgery before being discharged and transferred to the Hospital of Special Surgery in New York City. There he will undergo two to three more surgeries to rebuild part of his palm that he lost. After these surgeries, Daniel will have to undergo various therapies to help him adapt to this injury. In addition, Daniel will explore the options of further surgeries for the reconstruction of the hand and fingers and/or prosthesis. Daniel is a 20 year old Syracuse University Student in the Visual Performing Arts department studying acting. Daniel is from Sea Cliff, NY on Long Island and has always had an active life growing up. He has played many sports, performed in plays at his local theater group, and has been involved in various charity events on Long Island. Daniel attended the Waldorf School of Garden City growing up, and afterwards the Long Island Lutheran High School. At Syracuse, he is a apart of the fraternity Psi Upsilon where he’s involved with various philanthropic events.Daniel has always been an inclusive, helpful and well-liked human being. He’s always made a positive impact on anyone he meets. He has always been very determined with any task that’s been set before him including this difficult situation he has been faced with. Everyone who knows Daniel knows that he will without a doubt be able to push himself through this injury, but unfortunately he will not be able to do so without incurring numerous medical expenses. Daniel has always cared deeply for his family and has been worried about the medical costs for rehabilitation since his tragic injury. To help Daniel not be mentally burdened with the thought of paying for his medical bills, we are asking the public for their support. With your support not only will you help our family make sure that we can afford anything that Daniel needs to make a recovery, but you will also allow Daniel to completely focus on his rehabilitation so that he can take his next step forward in life and his career. Daniel is determined to get himself healthy and active again and with your support we can make this happen. With much love and gratitude,Peter Le Porin

Jazylyn suffered a traumatic brain injury and spent six months in a coma at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. She was not expected to survive but miraculously she was released from the hospital in April. Jazylyn’s parents, Dickson and Afia want to thank their Church and Springfield communities for their support while Jazylyn was in the hospital and for joining them to welcome her home.  Coming home: After the accident, Jazylyn’s parents were told that if their daughter survived, she would need an accessible living space. So, they found a place that would accommodate Jazylyn in Media, where we became new neighbors and friends. The Yeboahs are wonderful people and getting to know them has been a real joy. Although they have not asked for help to care for Jazylyn, it is apparent that they really could use some.  When Jazylyn emerged from the coma, they said they felt so much relief and hope. They looked forward to some normalcy with the family reunited at home. But home life is anything but normal when managing the care of a child with a brain injury. Jazylyn is totally dependent on her parents for all her care. While at Children’s Hospital, the medical staff provided round the clock for her, and now that mission falls to Afia and Dickson. As difficult and overwhelming as it is, they approach every day with joy and gratitude for their daughter’s life and promise of recovery. While at home, Jazylyn receives speech, physical and occupational therapy via Children’s Hospital telehealth visits. When the COVID restrictions are lifted, she will travel to Children’s for therapy sessions and to attend day school for kids with special needs. It is expected to be a long and arduous journey for Jazylyn as treatments can bring many complications for a medically frail child. Meeting the Yeboahs: When I first visited the Yeboahs, they walked me home. Afia explained that in Africa, when you leave someone, you walk a ways with them to make them feel cared for and safe. I thought how kind of them to think of others, when they are facing so many challenges themselves. For most of us, it is difficult to ask for help, and the Yeboahs are no exception. So, I am asking on their behalf. This is a heartfelt ask of you to consider supporting Jazylyn’s journey to recovery. THE YEBOAHS NEED HELP WITH JAZYLYN’S JOURNEY, TO WALK A WAYS WITH THEM. Everyday life: After Jazylyn’s accident, Dickson and Afia had to give up work. They spent six months at Children’s Hospital taking turns at their daughter’s bedside. Even with Jazylyn home, they do not have the freedom to return to their jobs. COVID-19 presents higher risks to a medically frail child and visits to their home are off limits. The Yeboahs, like most of us are sheltered in place but their experience is quite different. They are caring for a child with a traumatic brain injury 24/7 and three other young children, with a drastic reduction in income.  How is Jazylyn? Before the accident, Jazylyn was a loving and bright kid who excelled in math and science, loved soccer, and running long distances with her Dad.  Her therapists report that she approaches her daily therapy with the same determination. Rarely does she get frustrated with her wheelchair, leg splints, or left side paralysis. And she has made some progress – she can stand unattended for a short time and speaks in almost complete sentences. Her parents say she is as loving now as she was before the accident. She smiles, understands a joke, and says thank you for every little thing you do for her.  What is her prognosis? It’s too soon to know the level of functions Jazylyn will recover, but her parents are confident that once she begins to work with the rehabilitation team in person, she will make significant improvement. Hopefully, she will regain cognitive-communications skills, be able to walk on her own, and ultimately transition to school and community life. There are many uncertainties about Jazylyn’s future, but her parents are determined to do whatever it takes to help her regain participation in the world. AS THE YEBOAHS WAIT TO BEGIN JAZYLYN’S REHABILITATION, EXPENSES PILE UP What help is there? Families with brain injured children face financial hardships and many go on to bankruptcy. There are no public or private funds to cover living expenses of families who, like the Yeboahs, must care for their disabled children. Funds for children with brain injuries are found in a school system’s special education programs.  How you can help: Your contribution will help the Yeboahs care for Jazylyn at home and help with daily travel expenses to Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia. It would ease the burden of not meeting their monthly bills so they can focus on Jazylyn’s recovery and rehabilitation. They are hopeful that after six months, Jazylyn will improve to the point that one of them could resume work. You can walk a ways with them on this journey towards Jazylyn’s recovery. They only ask for your prayers. They need those and a little financial help too. It will be a long road to recovery but with their joyful attitude and determination, and your help they will have a safe passage.PS To old friends, new friends, and their friends please consider financially helping this wonderful family. Please share Jazylyn’s story on your social media pages. By sharing, it increases the chances of reaching our goal. Thank you very much.Read more"

Many of you already know, but for those that don’t, Claire Danson had a horrendous cycling collision with a tractor at the end of August. She broke pretty much every bone above her belly button including ribs, arms, shoulders, jaw, neck, wrists, skull, punctured both lungs and critically, broke her back with a complete spinal sever at T9, paralysing her from there downwards.Claire is GB Triathlete and is the current reigning European champion at Olympic distance. She has also won many races including her first half Ironman in Sardinia and her most recent 70.3 in Staffoldshire. She was also on the brink of gaining her Pro Licence. Claire has done all of this by funding herself through working as a tutor, teaching children science and maths.On the 28th August Claire was airlifted to Southampton spinal intensive care unit where she’s been recovering ever since. She has had multiple surgeries on her back, arms, shoulder and wrists all of which are healing nicely; however, she has been very poorly indeed.Claire, once well enough will be transferred to Salisbury Duke of Cornwall Spinal Unit where we are told she’ll spend 3-6 months learning everything there is regarding life in a wheel chair... knowing Claire, she’ll get the hang of things very quickly and be pushing to go onto the next part of her journey straight away.Whilst Claire was initially in and out of her induced coma and unable to talk or move, we communicated in very small periods by going through the alphabet, when we got to a letter that would eventually spell out a word, she would squeeze our hand. This was obviously a long process but the first word she spelt out was SORRY and second word was PARA-ATHLETE. Obviously, Claire has a long way to go before getting to this stage but very much sums up Claire’s ambition, resolve and determination, which has been nothing but inspiring and unbelievable.We have set up this GoFundMe in response to the overwhelming number of people who have been in touch wanting to know how to help and support Claire. We hope to raise funds for Claire as well as awareness for why she is still with us today. Simply put, without her helmet, her fitness & strength, the air ambulance and Southampton’s incredible Neuro ICU, Claire wouldn’t be here today. The funds raised through this page will help Claire on her journey to achieve whatever she wishes. It will support her rehabilitation and provide her with vital equipment and services required for her to fulfil her potential… maybe even buy her first race chair!We will also be running events to support the charities & organisations involved with the fantastic care Claire's already received, and will continue to receive for months / years to come.The whole way through this journey any letter, card or message Claire has received has given her instant joy, energy and the biggest smile on her face... as always, peoples thoughts and time hold the highest value so please do leave a message alongside any pennies you wish to donate. It will be ingrained in Claire’s mind and serve as a constant reminder that anything she is able to purchase from your contributions is a direct gift from her friends, family and wider support network.Thank you for coming on this journey and being a part of Team Claire.

In a matter of weeks she was forced to leave behind her old life - her home, her job, her friends and the opportunity to enjoy her baby's first year of life as she needed intensive care throughout her treatment.She had major surgery on 16th March 2018 where they battled for 9 hours on the operating table to save her leg. They managed to save it but significant damage was done. She endured four more rounds of chemotherapy and intensive rehabilitation to learn how to walk again.A standard scan a couple of weeks ago has devastatingly shown the cancer has returned with a tumour in each lung. Unfortunately these cancerous cells were not killed by the chemo and are now immune to it. There are no real options for her in Australia. She is a fighter and for the sake of her daughter she has been accepted into the Bejing Puhua International Hospital, in China, where they have been working with sarcoma patients over the past 5 years through an American trial. This treatment is expensive - $100 000 - will cover the cost of treatment, accommodation & flights. She deserves this fighting chance for her daughter, as the odds are now grim if left without this new treatment.Nicole is 29 years old and Summer is 19 months old. Both beautiful. They deserve the opportunity to beat this insidious disease and have a future together.Any help is greatly appreciated. We intend to share more of her story as it unfolds.

Within 48 hours of being there she had lost all feeling from her breast down. An MRI was performed and they found a large abscess that was crushing her spine. This abscess caused her to have a spinal stroke and she was rushed to Trillium Hospital for emergency spinal surgery. After hours of surgery she was moved to the ICU to start recovering. It was touch and go for the first 2 weeks but she was starting to stabilize medically. She was moved to the spinal floor to start rehabilitation but within the first week there they determined that the chance of her ever regaining feeling was not good. Tina spent 2 months in the hospital trying to get strong enough to be moved to the Lyndhurst Spinal Rehab Center. Tina has now been in the Rehab center for 3 weeks. She is getting stronger and they are teaching her how to live without the use of her torso and legs. They are also trying to regulate her medications because she has extreme muscle spasms.

He was having dizziness, moments of lethargy and lightheadedness. The drs requested CT scans and noticed some bleeding on the brain. The continued scans showed no change so that was a good sign.Sun 11/01/2020 - Monday 11/-2/2020 Jeff had aspirated into his lungs while at the hospital. His heart stopped around 3:45 am for about 1-3 minutes. He did respond but he was placed on a ventilator and sedated so that he could start to heal.Wed- Fri 11/04- 11/06 Fluid on lungs and high fevers. Pneumonia. MRI and spinal tap ordered. Spinal tap negative, MRI did NOT show major damage to the brain.Fri 11/06 - Mon 11/09 The blood on the brain is dry and appears to be causing pressure on the brain, which may be attributing to the unconscious state and could cause potential stroke so they are considering surgery to relieve that pressure.Since that first week so many things have transpired. Jeff has had not 1, but 2 surgeries to remove dry blood from brain using drains.The extent of Jeff's brain injury is not truly known and won't be until he wakes up all the way. At this time he is completely off of sedation but is not responding to commands. He has a very long road of recovery ahead of him, with lots of rehabilitaion.Drs say that improvements and rehabilitation will take months.At this time we want to help the Cagle family with any upcoming expenses. There may be medical transfers that need to be covered, home adjustments that need to be made (ramps, etc), full time care and lots of medical bills that will only be partially covered.

They expected him to be out of surgery after 8 hours, home 5 days later and recuperating for the following month. On June 30th, Justins wife Michelle called each family member around 11pm to say there were complications and he was still in surgery. Because of a leak around the heart they were unable to close his chest and were expecting to leave him open overnight hoping it would resolve itself by clotting. What happened over the next 52 days put all our faith to the test, and took Justin far from the outcome he had been expecting. Once they did close his chest, they were unable to remove him from the heart and lung machine, then he developed fever, kidney failure, inability to remove the sedation (had to keep him in a coma) lung issues forced them to have to flip him onto his stomach throughout the day to help his lungs and eventually he needed a tracheostomy. In a nutshell, he was unable to breathe on his own and his body was fighting off one or more unidentified infections.After a long fight, a slow process of waking up and learning to breathe, eat, talk and walk again Justin finally made it home late August, albeit still in a very fragile state with daily medical care needed.Here's where our ask comes in, hearts in hands. Not only was Justin unable to work while he was waitlisted for months for surgery because of COVID delays, but his rehabilitation time has gone far beyond expected as his recovery has been MUCH slower than initially thought. Michelle is working full time but resources are running out. This year has been tough on everyone, and the challenges seem to just keep coming. We want to stress that even the smallest amount will help. We would like to ask you to help them get through these next months with a little less stress, and a little more focus on the amazing gift of life and extra time we get with Justin. Every day is truly a gift, and they deserve to feel that especially during a time like this.**Donations received will go directly to them for housing, utilities, payments and medical costs. As Justin had started a new job just prior to his diagnosis, he had not yet qualified for the employee insurance program, which has left them responsible for much of the bill for his medications and rehabilitation programs.Read more"

On Saturday, June 20, I was devastated to learn that Miguel was the victim of a serious car accident in Stamford. He suffered injuries in the brainstem area, causing him to be in a coma. For 21 days, he was in the Intensive Care Unit at Stamford Hospital fighting for his life. During that time, he had multiple surgeries, including a craniotomy, tracheostomy, and arm surgery. He remains at the hospital in Special Care. Now we need your prayers, positive energy, and support to help Miguelito (as his mom calls him) in his recovery journey. This unexpected event has been a huge emotional and financial strain for his parents. They are at the hospital every day during the allowed visiting hours. This where they want to be and this is where Miguel needs them in order to inspire him to respond and recover. But their time in the hospital also limits the amount of time they are able to work.

Muiguel holding daddy’s hand and holding on to life.The doctors still do not know how well Miguel will recover, but we know he will need specialized care and long rehabilitation. He is here legally as a DACA recipient, (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), but his status also limits his access to insurance. His student health insurance will soon end since he will not be going back to UConn for now. I loved tutoring Miguel in math during his high school years. He had a great attitude and a calm way of looking at life. “No worries, I will be fine for the testtomorrow,” he would tell me with his beautiful smile.What always impressed me about Miguel was the deep love he showed for his parents and how caring and helpful he was with them. Just a little over a month ago, Miguel’s mom told me with so much joy and pride how well Miguel was doing in college.He made it to UConn with a full scholarship and had made the Dean’s List. Miguel had only one year left of college before graduating with a major in communications. Even in those dark moments when Miguel was in a profoundly deep coma and the doctors gave her little reason to hope for a better outcome, Miguel’s mom still maintained hope. Againstallodds, Miguelito has made progress.He is now moving his eyes and shows some movement in his hands. We are all so very happy for him.We need your contributions to make sure that he continues his rehabilitation and so that his dedicated mom can take care of him once he is discharged from the hospital.Thank you for making a difference in Miguel’slife through your prayers and financial support.Thank you for giving Miguel a chance.

On Saturday, July 18th, Taylor Janssen dove to get a volleyball off his pontoon boat on Lake Sherwood into shallow water and broke his neck at the C5 vertebrae. Taylor is currently in intensive care at U of M Hospital, paralyzed but with full mental capacity.For those who know Taylor, he is a one of a kind kid. From his father, Mark: ""Taylor, who came into this world 3 plus months premature, has always been a fighter. Also, as his mother would say: he is a Janssen and Janssens do not give up.""Taylor is one of those guys that is always willing to help anyone in need, so we, the brothers of Phi Kappa Psi Michigan Alpha, have decided that it’s time to help our brother Taylor in his time of need. Our love and support will go a long way in aiding Taylor's recovery. With your support, we can raise money to make Taylor's hospital stay more comfortable, as well as provide him with the best care possible during his rehabilitation process.With the outpouring of support seen so far, the goal has been raised to $175,000 and we hope this is just the beginning. All proceeds that do not go towards Taylor's rehab and hospital bills will be donated to the Kathy A. Janssen Foundation, a memorial foundation set up in the loving memory of Taylor's mother to provide financial assistance to causes that captivated Kathy during her life. For more information on that cause, follow this link: Kathy A Janssen Foundation. The entirety of the funds raised during this campaign will be given to the Janssen family and they will decide how to use the donations in order to best help Taylor.Read more"

On Sunday, April 26th,Cole was found by Justice on the couch unable to respond but breathing on his own. He was rushed to the local hospital where a CT scan was done that showed a brain bleed in the midbrain, with swelling all over his brain. This portion of the brain controls the body’s ability to wake up. Cole was in a coma and they intubated him to protect his airway. They arranged to have him airlifted to MHTW but during the flight, they had to land due to mechanical issues and completed his transportation by ambulance. Once we arrived at MHTW, they placed EVD Drains which helps remove the extra fluid from the brain. On Monday, they did an angiogram which confirmed that it is an AV Malformation. AVMs are not hereditary, but congenital meaning that they show up as small children but are not passed from parents to children. Repeat CT Scans have shown less fluid, but the blood will need 4-8 weeks to dissolve back into the fluid. Over the next few days, they placed a tracheostomy and feeding tube. On May 5th, Cole began waking up from his coma! He started following commands and giving us a thumbs up. He's been able to write both his and Justice names and give her the best hugs/kisses she's ever received! On May 12th , they were able to remove his drain tubes and place a shunt to help the fluid continue to drain. He still has the trach but has been able to begin using the speaking valve but is working on using his vocal cords again so he is mouthing things but is not speaking on his own yet  He has been working his booty off with PT/OT and speech therapy! On May 14th, Cole had his first freedom ride from MHTW ICU and is now getting the best rehabilitation in Houston at TIRR in the Medical Center! We still don't know what deficits Cole may have when this is all over, but we all know how strong he is and how hard he is fight! Cole's journey to recovery will be a marathon and not a sprint.

Une demande que je ne pensais jamais faire. En fait, je croyais que la vie, le gouvernement ou encore les associations de ce monde apporteraient bien plus de soutien pour cette situation. Je vous explique.Mon père, Roger, a fait une tentative de suicide le 18 février dernier. Il est brûlé à plus de 30% de son corps dont le plus important est au niveau des deux mains, du visage et des épaules. Il a été dans le coma pendant environ 1 mois. Il a dû avoir de nombreuses greffes et opérations. Ce n'est pas terminé, il aura besoin de nouvelles opérations au niveau des mains, des yeux et du nez dans les prochains mois. Mon père a été hospitalisé au total 115 jours à l'hôpital de l'Enfant Jésus. Il est présentement à l'IRDPQ (centre de réhabilitation) depuis juin et y sera encore quelques mois. Les médecins ne peuvent se prononcer sur l'état de ses mains dans un an ainsi que la capacité qu'il aura à l'emploi. Ils ne savent pas s'il pourra à nouveau faire le travail qu'il aime tant. Ils ne savent pas non plus s'il pourra à nouveau faire du travail en forêt. Ceux qui le connaisse savent qu'il aime tant s'y retrouver. Ils ne savent pas s'il pourra à nouveau utiliser ses outils; ce qui cause un problème supplémentaire puisqu'il était en pleine auto-construction. Mon père a servi la municipalité de Sainte-Luce pendant 25 ans en tant que pompier volontaire puisqu'il aimait venir en aide aux autres. Ce qui est sûr pour le moment, c'est qu'il ne pourra pas travailler la prochaine année. Pour la suite, tout est flou encore. Ce qui me pousse à faire cette demande de financement, c'est qu'il n'a plus de chômage maladie depuis mai et ne peut pas avoir la prestation d'urgence (PCU) puisqu'il n'est pas disponible pour le travail actuellement. Nous avons aussi fait une demande à l'Association des Grands Brûlés (FLAM). Ils pourront aider pour une partie des produits de santé ainsi que pour l'hébergement à Québec. Mon père aura besoin d'une reconstruction au niveau du visage ou encore d'un épithèse (prothèse). Le coût de celui-ci est de minimum 1200$ dépendent du type de rétention (façon de le fixer au visage) qu'ils pourront lui faire et elle devra être remplacée au 18 mois environ. Nous avons fait diverses autres recherches, mais rien. Aucune aide. Ce que le gouvernement nous dit, c'est qu'il devrait tout vendre et vivre avec cet argent. C'est complètement absurde. Mon père n'aura aucun revenu et aucune possibilité de travailler même s'il le voudrait tellement... pendant minimum un an. De plus, ma mère fait tout ce qu'elle peut mais elle ne peut finir la maison seule et elle ne peut subvenir à leurs besoins qu'avec son salaire. Ils ont besoin d'aide! Mon père souffrait d'une dépression majeure et d'une fatigue excessive. Personne n'est à l'abris de vivre une telle situation... Nous croyons qu'une situation comme celle-ci ne nous arrivera jamais. Ça commence, la fatigue nous empare, plus rien ne marche... Nous nous disons que demain, ça ira mieux... Mais demain est encore difficile, voire pire. Mais la vie continue et on continue d'avancer. L'idée que tout va toujours mal se dessine dans notre tête... On en oublie les belles choses de la vie.

My name is Julia. I am Greg's sister. For those of you that know my brother, asking for this kind of help and assistance is extremely hard, but as a lifelong Pleasanton resident and Foothill High School Alumni we are asking for your support. In September 2019, Greg went to the doctor because he found a lump in the back of his upper thigh. The doctor initially believed it was just a fatty deposit and ordered an ultrasound. There were issues with the scheduling and months went by due to the back and forth with the doctor and schedulers. Multiple doctors later, a CT scan was finally done in November 2019 and he was diagnosed with a malignant cancer called myxoid liposarcoma. The tumor is graded at a 3 currently, but until surgery is done we won't know for sure. It could turn out to be a grade 4. The initial scan shows the tumor is wrapped around the sciatic nerve and the surgery will be difficult. Greg underwent 5 weeks of radiation therapy from December 2019 through January 2020. During this same time period, our Dad suffered a severe brain hemorrhage and resulting brain surgery and Greg remained by his side in the hospital despite being in great physical pain himself from the radiation burns he endured. Our Dad ultimately passed at the end of January. Greg was stretched thin trying to work and be there for his family and his students throughout this ordeal. Reconstructive surgery will be done concurrently with the removal of the cancerous tumor and surrounding tissue. The surgeons will determine during surgery if the cancer has spread to more areas. Various muscles will be impacted and his recovery is projected to be long and very arduous. It will require him to be flat on his back for at least 4-6 weeks, perhaps longer. Once that recovery is done, he will begin the long rehabilitation process andhe will be in a skilled nursing facility when discharged from the hospital for at least another 4-6 weeks. Although the doctors can't predict the long term health issues he will have going forward, they did say he will have mobility issues for the rest of his life. The concurrent surgeries will be performed on March 12, 2020 as Greg needed to heal from the burns and radiation pain for more than a month before the surgery could be performed. Greg has been married to his wife Jennifer for 29 years. They have two grown sons, Christian and Nick, and a daughter, Olivia, who is currently in middle school. Greg started teaching at FHS in 1998 and has taught Biology, AP biology and Zoology. He taught a summer program through UC Berkeley called the Academic Talent Development Program for17 years only stopping last summer due to the debilitating fatigue he suffered as a result of the tumor. Greg loves being a teacher and making a difference in his students lives and their future aspirations. He has written thousands of college referral letters for his students over his career. Nothing makes him happier than helping students attain their dreams. He also loves when students contact him years after graduation and hearing about the lives they have built. They fondly call him ""Superman"" and ""Marty"". My hope is that you will find it within your hearts to send some donation to assist Greg and his family with the already mounting medical expenses and his current and future loss of salary and unknown rehabilitation costs and to provide a sense of comfort for him and his family as we all maneuver through this new reality.  Thank you in advance and bless you all.

There is no doubt that this special location has provided each of us with precious memories. Prayers are not going to guarantee our beloved sanctuary will survive the pandemic. When things get back to normal, we will all need to plug back into our familiar, friendly and supportive home away from home once again. We need the Wash to reclaim the year we have lost and the friends that are in limbo. It is important for our collective social rehabilitation.Bob has been forced to close the Washington Club like many other businesses due to the Coronavirus Pandemic. Due to location and size, he is unable to open under current regulations in any meaningful or profitable way. Since we’ve known Bob over 15 years, he’s been the friendliest and most professional bartender/host in all of the East Bay. Imagine finally realizing a life’s dream of owning your own establishment, being able to make the right decisions for your clientele and providing a clean and safe environment. Making upgrades and improvements that made us all feel welcome, where everyone knows your name and attentive barkeeps who know exactly how you like your drinks. Having overcome personal health challenges that would have crippled most of us, he fought back and thankfully, made it through the rain.COVID-19 has wreaked havoc on all of us – lives lost, jobs, businesses, schools and many more losses than we can count. The Washington Club has always been an integral part of our social community – a sanctuary to decompress after work, a venue of memories and laughter and our adult “playground” where friends gathered in mutual support.Bob has always given back to our collective communities in many ways:-Free food-Pool leagues-Special events-Birthdays-Weddings-Fundraisers for Davis Street Center, Breast Cancer Awareness, San Francisco AIDS Walk and the AIDS/LifeCycle ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles.It’s OUR collective turn to give back – not to Bob personally – but to OUR beloved Washington Club. Think about the missed life celebrations we have lost this past year. Think about what the Washington Club has meant to YOU PERSONALLY. We need the Washington Club to get back to NORMAL and to heal from the COVID depression we have all felt.Regretfully, Bob is running out of time with the Washington Club. If he does not catch up on rent by April 15th, he will be forced to move out. Please give what you can. Anything will help. The landlord is willing to work with him if Bob can pay him some money every month until the balance is paid down. If in the end Bob regretfully must close the Wash, we promise we will keep detailed records of donations given and those donations will be returned to the donors.Thank you so much for helping keep the Washington Club alive!Love you all,Skip and JohnRead more"

My otherwise perfectly healthy husband Scott, devoted father to our three young daughters, has been infected with a rare bacterial infection, which almost ended his life. Scott has been hospitalized for the past eight weeks and is currently in a specialty hospital in Utah. In just 8 weeks, he has endured THIRTEEN surgeries … with more to go, including skin grafts and amputation of his toes. To stop the rapidly spreading infection, surgeons removed approximately 90% of the skin on his right leg, from his hip to his ankle. Our family has been impacted emotionally by this ordeal, and the financial strain is only adding to it. We are grateful for any contribution you can make, no matter how small, to help us through this challenging time.￼Scott with his family, October 2018About ScottScott is a 42-year old dedicated husband and loving father to three little girls, ages 4, 6 and 7. He is a very active person who has a passion for the outdoors. He is an avid mountain climber, whitewater kayaker and rafter, mountain biker, and surfer. He has a goal to climb the high point of every state. To date, he has climbed 32 state highpoints! Scott climbed Grand Teton in Idaho last summer, and Mount Rainer in Washington the prior year.￼Scott climbing various peaks and map showing state highpoints with pins on states where he has climbed the highpoint￼Scott enjoying various outdoor activitiesScott’s main passion for life are his three daughters: Layne, Taylor and Avery. Being the best father possible and raising our girls to be strong, independent, adventurous women is central to him. Idaho has been our home for the past 15 years. We are proud to raise our daughters in this amazing area. We take advantage of our proximity to the beautiful Idaho landscape as much as we can. We love taking them rafting on our scenic rivers, camping at state parks, or hiking the numerous trails around the state.￼Scott and his three daughters at Bull Trout Lake, July 2018What is Necrotizing Fasciitis (from the CDC website)Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare bacterial infection that spreads quickly in the body and can cause death. Accurate diagnosis, rapid antibiotic treatment, and prompt surgery are important to stopping this infection. Necrotizing fasciitis can lead to sepsis, shock, and organ failure. It can also result in life-long complications from loss of limbs or severe scarring due to surgically removing infected tissue. Even with treatment, up to 1 in 3 people with necrotizing fasciitis die from the infection. The CDC reports that since 2010, approximately 700 to 1200 cases occur each year in the United States.Scott’s StoryIn early February 2019, Scott mis-diagnosed himself with what he thought was the Flu. He spent four days in bed with very intense flu-like symptoms. By Monday evening, February 4th, Scott _ who is rarely sick _ was so ill he requested to be taken to the ER. He was also complaining about pain in his right leg, which he thought was from pulling a muscle while snowboarding. After multiple MRIs and various tests (including a negative Flu test) Scott was admitted into the Medical ICU, approximately 10 hours after going into the ER. At that point, they still had not confirmed the cause of his illness. While changing into his hospital gown, it was apparent that the pain in Scott’s right leg stemmed from something much more than a pulled muscle. His inner thigh was purple with red blisters in an area about the size of basketball. He was taken into surgery that morning. An orthopedic surgeon performed debridement, which means to remove the infected tissue on this leg. Since fluid was found in his abdomen in an MRI, a general surgeon also performed laparoscopic surgery to explore the extent of the infection in his abdomen. All things considered, the surgery went as well as could be expected. The orthopedic surgeon debrided the infected skin and fascia tissue and reported the infection did not reach the muscle. The general surgeon found signs of infection, but his organs appeared to be okay; however, she did remove his appendix. That’s when it seemed like all hell broke loose. Scott was kept intubated on a ventilator and sedated post-surgery, so he was unaware of the trauma that awaited him. Upon his return to the ICU it was discovered that Scott had no pulse in his right leg. He was again rushed into surgery where a vascular surgeon identified the location of an obstruction. The vascular surgeon performed an arterial graft so Scott would regain blood flow in his leg. Upon his return to the ICU, doctors and teams of nurses worked furiously to keep Scott alive. At one time he had 12 different IV medications going simultaneously. His blood pressure kept dropping so he was on four vasopressors. During the night, his heart went into V-tach and a “code blue” was called and a crash cart was pulled into the room. His body was in shock. With all of this going on, his leg worsened. The orthopedic surgeon, general surgeon, and urologist were called in to perform more debridement surgery. His abdomen was opened up for further exploration. Over the next six days, Scott remained hemodynamically unstable while undergoing more debridement surgeries, removing infected skin and fascia tissue. He was put on dialysis since his kidneys were failing. By the following Monday, a week after first going to the ER, Scott had undergone six surgeries with multiple surgeons. Once he was stable enough he was life-lighted to the University of Utah Burn Center. After the initial exam by the burn center attending physician, I was reminded how serious his case is, and that “he could still die from this.” Not the words I was hoping to hear after finally getting him transported to a place with doctors who are more experienced with NF. At the burn center, he underwent five more debridement surgeries in the effort to get ahead of the infection. By then, muscle tissue on his upper leg, which was protecting the arterial graft, was showing signs of dying, so a muscle flap was preformed to protect the graft. He underwent more surgeries to debride and prepare his leg for repairs. ￼Scott after three weeks of being intubated, February 2019Scott’s Re-BirthdayOn February 22nd, 17 days after undergoing his first surgery, Scott was extubated (taken off the ventilator) and awoken out of medical sedation. By that time, he had undergone 11 surgeries and approximately 90% of the skin had been removed from his right hip and groin area, down to his ankle. He was on dialysis for his failing kidneys, a feeding tube, and multiple IV ports and sensors. Fortunately, I had Scott’s family by my side: his brother Phil, who had just flown in the night before, as well as his sister, Ashley, who drove to SLC from Boise that day. I’m not sure if it was Scott’s strength, or the sedation meds still in his system, but Scott took the news of the extensive damage to his body very well. Once he understood what had happened, he immediately focused on what it would take to get better and be back with his family. ￼Scott on his Re-Birthday with his sister Ashley and brother Phil, February 2019Starting the Long Road to RecoveryWithin a few days of waking up, Scott was re-intubated and underwent two more surgeries (thirteen to date) to prepare his leg for future skin grafts. After a few days he was able to be removed from dialysis treatment since his kidneys were regaining function. He also was able to get many of the IV lines removed since he can take most of his medications through the feeding tube.Because Scott’s body remained inactive for so long, the rest of his body became deconditioned. In addition, he has lost dexterity in his right hand due to a blood cut in that arm. A team of physical therapists work with him twice a day to help him gain strength back and learn how to walk again. Scott will need to have the toes on his right foot amputated at some point. We don’t know yet if Scott will lose all of his toes, or just the tips.The medical team is unable to give us a timeframe for when Scott will be able to return home. Sometimes he seems energetic, however quite often he is exhausted from even the smallest activity, such as sitting in a chair or brushing his teeth. The toll this tragedy has taken on Scott’s family is also apparent. While our daughters were kept isolated from much of the medical crisis mentioned above, they were aware that their Daddy was very ill and that Mommy needed to be at the hospital with him. They were without both parents for a full month before I felt Scott was stable enough for me to leave Utah to travel back to Boise. The behavioral changes in each of them are understandable considering the circumstances. The changes in our youngest daughter is so apparent that we’ve decided to reach out to a child psychologist. ￼First time sitting up. Scott's right leg covered in Wound Vac., February 2019How You Can HelpNow Scott, our beloved husband/father/son/brother/friend, has another mountain to climb. This time, however, the mountain is figurative, and one he never expected to face. Scott has a long road ahead of him to be able to resume any sense of normalcy in his life. Knowing how strong and determined he is, he will not stop rehabilitation until he’s able to climb mountains again. We are fortunate to have medical insurance, which has helped us with many medical expenses. Scott faces more surgeries and physical therapy. Understandably, he is now unable to work and provide for our family, and will be on disability for a very long time. Please consider contributing to our family, and sharing this story with your friends and family. No amount is too small to help us as he recovers from this terrible illness. Scott's next surgery is scheduled for April 4th. We will update this space as he undergoes more surgeries.￼Scott at the Univ of Utah Hospital, March 2019Read more"

Over the Thanksgiving holiday, my best friend, David Ravella suffered a stroke.As you can imagine this came as a great shock to me, as David has never had any significant health issues in the past. When David was admitted to the hospital, they tested him for Covid-19 and the results came back negative. However, after an antibodies test was performed it showed that he had Covid-19 at some point in the recent months. Covid-19 has been linked to stroke in young adults and doctors say it is likely the cause of David’s recent health issues.The following Monday, while recovering in Fairfax County Hospital he suffered another stroke, causing significant damage. The result of the second stroke left David with limited mobility on the right side of his body and great limitations in his speech, and weakened heart.As a result of his weakened heart, David had surgery to install a permanent pacemaker to help stabilize his heart.David is at an acute inpatient rehabilitation center where he is working on speech and physical therapy. We are very hopeful that he will make a remarkable comeback considering his young age and determination to keep fighting. David is moving in a positive direction, we also know he has a very long and challenging road ahead of him.David was at Fairfax Hospital for 5 weeks and is still in the inpatient rehabilitation program. He is expected to return to his parent’s house soon and will be continuing speech and physical therapy in outpatient rehab.Many of you have asked how you can help. David will be responsible for hospital bills, rehab bills, medical transportation costs and home healthcare. The best way that we can help right now is to alleviate the financial stress this has put on him and his family. Any amount you can donate is very much appreciated and will be put towards his mounting medical bills and recovery.Thank you and please feel free to reach out to me or Greg Ravella for any other information on how you can help.Read more"

She was given a CT scan, and it showed that she had a Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (brain bleed). She was flown to Capital Health hospital in Trenton and underwent and a procedure to take care of the bleed. During the procedure a very small aneurysm was found, and when trying to coil the aneurysm, it ruptured, so doctors had to clamp the blood vessel which forced her to have a stroke. After the procedure Mary was unable to speak and had very little movement with her body. For 17 days Mary stayed in the ICU where she was monitored 24 hours a day fighting for her life. She made small improvements each day, regained the function in the left side of her body rather quickly, regained her speech, but is still working on getting the function back in her right side. She was transferred to a rehabilitation center on August 1st that works with stroke victims. Doctors are optimistic about Mary’s recovery because she is young, healthy, and has a lot to live for. Unfortunately this recovery process is going to take some time. Luckily, Mary is supported so much by her family, her husband Jake, and her two little girls Julia and their 3 month old Madison. It will be months or years before Mary can get back to her nursing position at Centra State Hospital which she worked so hard for. Jake has decided to take a family leave from his teaching position until November so he can put all his attention and focus on Mary and the kids. He is also unsure if he will be able to work his secondary jobs as a football coach and waiter. I have known this family for years and this is just something that will help take some added pressure off of them.

He broke his C6 and C7 vertebrae, which left him paralyzed from the chest down. The doctor told him he has about 20% chance of walking again. Barry is currently at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston where he is getting stronger and becoming more independent every day. The journey to recovery will be long, however Barry is a fighter with strong faith, and knowing his spinal cord was not severed gives hope that he will continue improving. One of his near-term goals is to be able to participate in a program called Project Walkin order to gain the strength to ski again. Project Walk is an intense exercise-based training program with state-of-the-art technology to increase mobility in clients with spinal cord injuries. The facility is located in Stratham, NH and isn’t covered by insurance. A one-hour session costs approximately $110.00 - $150.00. We are hoping that the Lemire community will come together to give this gift and support Barry’s goal for Project Walk, as well as offset the cost of household changes that he needs for wheelchair accessibility in his home. Since the accident, the Lemire family have received an outpouring of love, prayers, and encouragement.They are positive, faithful, and immensely grateful for all of the support from family and friends.Barry, Susan, Matthew and Amanda thank you and ask that you continue to pray for healing and restoration. “Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, and faithful in prayer.” (Romans 12:12)Read more"

Right now she is dealing with one of the hardest things you can go through in life, admittedly with such grace, and never losing her faith. Merlie is one of the kindest people you will ever meet, and never thinks twice about helping others, but right now she needs your help. She is attempting to raise funds for her husband, Joel Mahinay. A few days after their son’s 12th birthday, their lives tragically changed forever. Joel suffered a major hemorrhagic stroke and was rushed to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey where he had an emergency open brain surgery. By the grace of God, the operation was a success, but major damage had already been done before the brain bleed could be stopped. This led to a 22-day stay in the ICU, totaling 30 days in the Comprehensive Center. Just two days after his surgery, Joel had to undergo another operation for tracheostomy and gastrostomy tubes to help him breathe and eat because he was unable to swallow. Day after day, Joel struggled to open his eyes, speak, or move the right side of his body. Although the surgery ultimately saved him, he continued to fight for his life and had to be placed on a ventilator while he had impaired kidney function and problems with his lungs. Joel is currently staying at Kessler Rehabilitation Center Institute in West Orange, New Jersey where he receives physical, occupational, and speech therapy services to aid in his recovery. Thankfully, he has maintained his ability to speak, but the stroke left him with aphasia and he has severe trouble speaking in sentences that consist of more than one or two words. The doctors tell us because of his significant stroke, it will take two years or longer for him to recover. The left side of his brain was affected by the stroke, causing the right side of his body to have no response. The recovery of his speech and right side of his body will be very slow. We are praying that the left side of his brain can eventually recover from the damage and regain control to his right side.Joel has had an uphill battle since the beginning, but he is a true fighter and continues to push through his recovery every day. Though he has made enormous strides and is set to be discharged home on June 13, 2019, he still has a long way to go in his recovery. He will require more medical attention and home-care physical therapy or outpatient rehabilitation. Joel has a long road ahead of him, but his family is thankful he will be with them and continue to watch his two children grow up. Merlie and her family are so grateful for the progress Joel has made but are now faced with the overwhelming financial obstacle of paying for the procedures and his rehabilitation. Before his stroke, Joel worked as a driver, a job that does not provide insurance, which leaves their family the task of paying thousands of dollars in medical bills. They are desperate to do everything they can to help Joel overcome this. They are doing their best but realize that this is more than they can afford, and cannot do it alone. The unthinkable has happened to their family, but the outpouring of love and support they have gotten from friends and family has lifted not only theirs, but Joel’s spirits as well. There isn’t anything that Joel wouldn’t do to help or give his time to those who need it, but now he truly needs the help of others. If you can donate to help us get Joel back to the life he was happily living, we appreciate any amount you can give. Thank you and God bless you and your families.Read more"

The boys had been working on a construction site out of town during the summer to make money for college, a job that required them to be on the road and working at extremely early hours. Tragically, this accident has dramatically altered their lives.Two of the boys, Douglas Hirschfeld and Patrick Brogan, were released from the hospital and, while their physical injuries have been treated, they will face emotional trauma from the accident for a long, long time. We ask that anyone reading this keep both of these young men in their prayers as they rebuild emotionally from such a traumatic event. The other three young men have remained in the hospital since the accident.Timmy Brogran (Patrick’s twin brother), Lewis Dilts (pictured on the homepage) and Luca Ruby continue to fight for their recovery at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis. Altogether the three have endured dozens of hours of surgery, have received more than 100 units of blood, and their injuries are too numerous to list completely. All three had their spleens removed. Two of the three had issues with their lungs. Two of the boys had shattered pelvises and fractured vertebrae. Between the three there were multiple compound fractures to their legs, broken arms, broken ribs, fractured vertebrae, damaged bladders and a great deal of internal bleeding.As of now, Luca Ruby has been removed from the ICU and is improving. The other two, Lewis and Timmy, are both still in critical condition, and have had surgeries lasting more than 5 hours on multiple days. They are both on continuous dialysis, are fighting infection, continue to be on ventilators and are fighting hard to improve.All of these young men had extremely bright futures. Two of them, Lewis and Luca, had plans to play collegiate athletics, and all of them were heading out to make a difference in the world. While it is a miracle and a blessing that they are all still with us, their road to recovery is still very long and painful and they need all the support and prayers they can get.The other thing these families need is financial assistance. Their parents are taking time away from work to be with them at the hospital and will need to continue to do so as the boys continue their recovery. The costs of the extensive surgeries and life-saving measures – not to mention the long-term costs of rehabilitation – will be staggering for all of the families involved.Many people throughout our community and beyond have asked how they can help and for those who wish to support these families financially, we have set up this Go Fund Me account. Rather than set up four separate accounts, we have established this one account for ease of use. A panel of four close friends of the families involved is administrating this account.

On the way she suffered a seizure. Upon arrival she was taken to the emergency Department where it was determined she needed a CT Scan. On the way to CT she suffered another seizure. Over the next 4 hours they performed various tests including a lumbar puncture. After exhausting their options they decided she needed an MRI of which they did not have the equipment. She was then transported by ambulance to St. Charles Bend. She went for the MRI that evening and it was determined that she has a 4mm x 7mm tumor over one of her speech centers in her brain. It is causing inflation and in turn causing her speech issues and seizures. She spent the next day and a half in the hospital finally becoming stable before they would let her go home. After meeting with a neurosurgeon is was determined that she now had an immediate need for another MRI, this one is a functional scan and the tumor would then be removed as soon as possible. Fortunately the functional MRI has shown that the tumor is 1/2 inch above the margins and should be able to be completely removed without affecting her speech center. Jerilee will be out of work a totaling approximately 4-5 weeks with her husband caring for her. She and her husband both love their jobs and have some vacation to use but let's face it, you don't get rich working in Animal Welfare. The Drynans have no insurance, they fall into that familiar grey area where they don't qualify for the affordable care and the full premiums for the basic plans are just too expensive. Thus have to pay for this out of pocket. This being the case they have small slush fund to pay for medical, this however far exceeds that fund.

There was no reason or justification for this tragic event except for these men to fulfill the potentially fatal fate of another man, my cousin and big brother. Reed suffered a fractured skull from the severe blow to the head he received by the men that attacked him, as well as added trauma when he smacked the pavement unconscious. In addition to this trauma, his lifeless body was kicked and continuously struck causing further injury. He was found moments later by his two friends that were able to both call for medical help and detain the men who so viciously attacked Reed.Reed was admitted to the ICU on Sunday, July 30th where he was put on life support because of his critical condition. Due to the fracture in his skull there was too much bleeding and pressure building up in his brain that he had to undergo an emergency craniotomy within the first 24 hours. Currently he still remains in critical condition and on life support. Due to all the brain trauma and swelling he must be kept in a deep induced coma which requires all of his bodily functions to be controlled by computers. Although his vitals are normal at the moment it is still to early to know the outcome.I don’t understand how or why things like this have to happen, but I know when tragedy strikes those close to us, it pulls our heart strings and implores us to help them in their time of need. Brain trauma can cause a wide range of issues along with surgeries, extended hospitalization, and rehabilitation that can take years including ongoing medical costs. This page is to help Reed and his family in their time of need.

Michael and Becca got married in August of 2019. They started to travel the country as Becca began work as a travel nurse. Like newlyweds should, they were enjoying being together and exploring new places. Becca’s most recent assignment had brought them to Bozeman, Montana.At 4:00 AM on February 8th, 2021, Becca woke to Michael falling out of bed and shaking on the floor. Once she realized this was a seizure, she called 911 and Michael was rushed to the Emergency Room. Once there, he had labs drawn and a CT scan. After hours of observation and clean tests, he was discharged with orders to follow up with outpatient neurology. Michael was feeling back to normal as they drove back to their hotel. They were confused by the event, but relieved they were discharged.Back at the hotel, Becca drove Michael to the side door of the hotel to wait inside while she parked the car so he wouldn't need to walk through the snow. When she returned from parking less than one minute later, she could see he was seizing again, only this time he was behind the locked glass door of the hotel.They returned to the ER for further care. After two more seizures and worsening diagnostic test results, it was quickly determined that the culprit of his seizures was a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis - a stroke, at 26 years old.

The hospital decided that the best course of action was for Michael to be transported by ambulance two hours away to a larger hospital in Billings, Montana for continuous brain monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit.Michael was started on medication to stop his seizures and is currently receiving treatment to assist in preventing further worsening of the blood clot in his brain that caused the stroke. If this treatment fails, and the injured area of his brain continues to expand, brain surgery at a third facility in Utah may be required to get Michael back to himself.

Michael remains hospitalized at this time. In addition to the ongoing clot, which is still evolving, Michael has lost most of the function of his right arm and hand. This seems to be worsening and will require months of physical therapy and occupational therapy to attempt to regain function in his dominant arm and hand once discharged.

As a family, we are requesting funds to help cover the emergency care, medical transportation, hospitalization, rehabilitation, and working hours that will be lost for Michael and Becca as Michael recovers from this life-changing medical event.

Thank you for taking the time to read their story!

***

About Michael: Michael is a extraordinary person and has loved being able to travel with Becca. He enjoys fantasy football and being outdoors. He has a passion for music and the arts and he is working on his MBA. In 2019, Michael was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis. His doctors think that the clot that caused the stroke (and triggered the seizures) was partially due to complications with the inflammation caused by UC. It was a perfect storm that allowed for this medical event. He is thankful to everyone wishing him well during his recovery.About Becca: Becca is a NICU nurse who has spent the last year as a travel nurse working in NICUs around the country. She has enjoyed traveling with Michael, meeting new people, and working in different environments. She loves her job and can't wait to get back to work once Michael is safe again.We love you all, thank you.

Link to CBS 4 News InterviewThe Organ family needs yourhelp!!My name is Daniel and on Sunday, July 26th, 2020 my sister Nicole, her husband Rob, and their two children, my niece (8) and my nephew (6), were involved in a fatal car accidenton the way home from a socially distanced dinner at our Mom’s house. At about 7:45 pm, they headed home, a drive that usually takes 7 minutes. When they were at the cross streets of Oberon Rd and Estes St, asuspected intoxicated manand his female passenger traveling on the opposite side of the road swerved into oncomingtraffic striking the family.Rob was able to slightly turn at the last minute and the brunt of the impact was the front and driver side. All were taken to the hospital immediately, except the female passenger of the other car who was pronounced dead at the scene.







Nicole suffered a broken collar bonewhich will likely need surgery in the coming week. Rob, who was driving, suffered a broken femur, a broken foot (which by doctors words, was unrecognizable as a foot), and a broken radius and ulna. My niece witnessed the driver tell the deceased women to get up multiple times and suffered a compounding fracture in her spine (L5), which causes her pain but is not serious, and my nephew was lucky to walk away with a couple seat belt bruises and a bloody nose. Rob had surgery for 7 hours on July 27th and underwent 3 more hours the next day with more to come. The Organs don’t like to ask for help but they will absolutely need it. In the coming months they will be facing many hardships including the sheer trauma caused by the crash, the pain of the injuries and rehabilitation, therapy for the family, countless hospital bills, lost wages and opportunities, and another car when they are healed enough to drive. Both heads of the family have been incapacitated, they have no way to get to many appointments, they can’t help each other physically and this has uprooted our whole family’s life in so many ways but we are dedicated to trying to make their amazing family whole as best we can. By donating and sharing you will be doing exactly that. We know times are very hard for everyone and we want you to know how much we appreciate all of you. Anything and everything helps even if it’s just a share or kind words.



I will post updates constantly on the family’s recovery and the upcoming trial. We are in contact with a public information officer who said there will be a publication of the accident soon so I will post a link when we have it. We’ve also been told that the police are planning on charging the man with one count of vehicular homicide and three counts of vehicular assault but it may take a year or two to see it through. They have already been so grateful for the outpouring support they have received from family, friends, and acquaintances. Please share this link and help us help the Organs. They are kind, intelligent, empathetic, caring good people and they did nothing to deserve this.

Thank you so much for your time, donations, well wishes and prayers. Most importantly hug your family and drive safe ❤️      Love Daniel

Luckily everyone got out without a scratch except Bhanu who received the major brunt of the ill-fated accident. He suffered multiple injuries to his neck including several fractured bones and major injuries to the C3, C4 and C5 Vertebrae.

His engaging personality and great sense of humor has brought many smiles across the faces of anyone he comes into contact with. He loved people in general. He has a history of helping others when they need it most, and has always tried to put a positive spin on any situation. He enjoyed introducing people to each other, asking questions, and learning new things.Unfortunately, we have some heartbreaking news to share about Sam. Last year, he started to experience some really bad headaches. He decided to get checked out at the hospital. He got a CT Scan, an MRI and had other tests done. The results found a mass that turned out to be a significant sized brain tumor. He immediately met with oncologists, neurologist, surgeons, and many other health care professionals in hopes to get the best possible medical care.In July of 2018, he agreed to have surgery to examine and eventually remove the tumor. Nearly 90% of the mass was removed successfully, but pathology reports determined it was Gliosarcoma. A highly aggressive form of brain cancer.After his surgery, he was receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy regularly. He was doing very well considering… Then, this past June, he started developing difficulties with balance, experienced a few seizures, and other debilitating neurological issues. He was in and out of rehabilitation as other symptoms developed. Recently, his health has declined to the point of a coma like state. There is little to no consciousness, no real response to stimulation, and he has been fitted with a breathing and feeding tube. From day one, our family has been in shock from this devastating news.His wishes were to go through this battle in private, but we feel like now is the time to reach out to all who knew him, so all can pray for as much healing as possible and for his comfort.Sam was unable to work for the past year because of all that has happened. Money has been getting tighter and tighter since he started his treatment, and we are now being told that some of the medical expenses are not covered under his insurance plan.Sam has a heart of gold and would do anything to help out any one of us in our time of need. He has always been a very faithful person and has always prayed for healing of all, including himself during this troubling time. So we are asking at this vulnerable time in his life that we rally behind him as he continues this fight. Every penny and every prayer counts. A little goes along way and can help alleviate the stress of monetary issues that have started to come up.#CancerSucks#PrayersforSamRead more"

At this time Gilly needs additional support to get heathy again after two ground breaking surgeries. These include private medical consultations, professional advice, Ayurveda treatments, dietary and healthy care needs, and all the hidden costs of recovering from advanced cancer and surgery.I have spoken to Gilly and persuaded her to let her friends show their support on this page, only of course if and when they are able. I know the funds will be well used by Gilly.  We know Gilly is not one to ask, so we will ask for her. About GillyGilly is a beloved friend to so many and mother to 4 beautiful children. From Edinburgh (a Scot through and through) she now lives in Luxembourg. Her career began after her studies at Aberdeen University in the House of Commons as a young researcher in 1993. A year later she started work at the BBC, as a researcher at the BBC World Service and then BBC Westminster. An offer to research Ted Heath’s memoirs led her back to the House of Commons and a year delving into the Prime Ministerial archives. A chance meeting with British comedy producer Geoff Atkinson led her to join VERA productions as a researcher on Channel 4’s satirical show, Rory Bremner and the Long Johns. The only job where she enjoyed free Bolly on a Friday! Gilly then moved on to report for Merdian’s political show 7 Days and then to Fulcrum TV where we met. Gilly started at Fulcrum as an assistant producer, moving to producer and director on the acclaimed Channel 4 Power List series and Dispatches. She moved back to the BBC in 1999 for the next 13 years, directing for BBC 2’s Antiques Show, as a Senior Producer on BBC Breakfast, and as a political journalist, producer and documentary filmmaker at BBC Scotland.’Gilly was awarded the BBC World Service Alexander Onassis Trust Award in 2000 and a prestigious Winston Churchill Fellowship in 2001. An award-winning journalist, her acclaimed documentary “The Hudsons Bay Boys” filmed across the Canadian Arctic in 2011, was put forward by the BBC for HotDocs Canada. Since 2013 she has been managing communications for Luxembourg for Finance. Meanwhile, Gilly has raised four children, Hudson, Frobisher, Franklin and Amundsen, named after explorers of the Northwest Passage, who love and need her very much. In September 2019, after being told her cancer was terminal, she fought for curative surgery and put herself in the hands of Professor Fichtner-Feigl, Universitätsklinikum Freiburg. On December 20, 2019, a team of 8 specialists over 9 hours removed all tumours and resectioned her colon, liver, pancreas and removed her gall bladder. She struggled in the hospital for the next three months after losing three-quarters of her liver during surgery. She returned to Luxembourg during Covid, which made it impossible to receive the rehabilitation she needed. Unfortunately, cancer came back after chemotherapy in October, and she underwent another liver surgery in Freiburg. No more chemotherapy is possible, so she is now exploring alternative treatments to keep cancer away. Gilly’s challenges right now are to find new therapies, regain her health, and enjoy her family and life.

On the morning of Friday March 20th, my father Lee Gillette was in a severe car accident with his dog Max in the car while on the highway and driving past the town of Todos Santos in Baja California del Sur, Mexico. He was driving back to California, a drive he's done a dozen times before. At about 45 minutes into his drive after having just drank an energy drink (nothing illegal in his system according to doctors), he seems to have passed out behind the wheel regaining consciousness while drifting towards a steep embankment which would have certainly been the end for him. He overcorrected the car, caught a wheel and flipped over, landing on its roof and partially pancaking in (photo below is from when they got the car back upright).A friend of my father's who was also driving as a caravan behind him in her car saw the entire thing and ran up to provide assistance. Upon arriving at the vehicle she couldn't believe my father was alive, let alone conscious (but in bad shape). Thankfully, the Saint Judes (a knockoff of the American hospital) ambulance pulled up shortly and hoisted him to a hospital for treatment. Though all of his cash and some of his belongings disappeared, he was alive - all we could hope for.Having not learned about my father's accident until Friday night, I immediately assumed and prepared for the worst. I could not locate my father, but thankfully the State Department was able to track him down to an urgent care hospital called Fidepaz in La Paz, Mexico, where he was being treated.I immediately booked a flight down and was able to be there the following evening, and he was in bad shape. I came to find out he had what’s called a hangman’s fracture. Doctors say it is a miracle that he survived (along with Max), and another miracle in the fact that he has full mobility in his extremities and no neurological damage.(photo below is after I cleaned him up a few days post-accident, and asked him for a smile).After a week in the hospital, I was able to get him the treatment he needed, including having what's called a 'Halo' Brace installed into his skull, designed to keep his neck in place.Having a broken neck in Mexico is no joke. With limited insurance for him and the car, and a system/situation that leaves me without any resources and minimal bargaining power, I had to shell out the equivalent $1,600 dollarsfor the first hospital that triaged him, and then another $4,000 dollars at Fidepaz hospital (photos attached in pesos) where they treated him for a week and installed the Halo brace. From there I was able to get him on a flight back through Los Angeles to Las Vegas, where he is with my younger brother Joshua who is an EMT and can provide longer term support than I would be able to in New Jersey.While I know that my father can and will pay me back, I do have concerns that in addition to replacing his car it, will set him back a lot of money. That's why I'm reaching out to the public to see if anyone can help soften that blow, especially considering the physical pain that he has already dealt with.If you know Lee Gillette, you probably love him. From being the baseball coach and umpire for my brother and I and many friends, to being a close confidant and support system for most everyone he came in contact with, my dad is 'the dude.' He has been touched by everyone's outpouring of support as he looks to get back on his feet (literally and figuratively) and anything that you can spare would be greatly appreciated. It is never easy having to see a loved one in such a state, but with a lot of luck and a ton of perseverance, I do believe that my father will make a full recovery. Looking to raise $10,000 to cover some of my father's medical bills ($5,600), the cost of flights and hotel stays for the week ($1,250) and a portion of the cost to replace his car. He will have to spend a lot of money on rehabilitation, specialist opinions, removal of the Halo brace, and I'd like to do everything I can to reduce the costs as much as possible.

Thanks in advance,Alex and Josh Gillette

Prior to her hospitalization she was enjoying her time with her children and grandkids. In total she has 30 grandkids who enjoy her company and love her dearly.Mrs. Antonia was a healthy and strong woman with no prior health conditions before COVID-19. In the past 3 weeks, the hospital has been pressuring us to remove Mrs. Antonia from the one machine that provides her with enough oxygen to continue living. If she is removed from the machine, she will be placed in hospice care and pass within 2 hours. The only other option is to send her to a rehabilitation center with the oxygen machine to give her enough time to recover. However, the hospital has said that moving her to a rehabilitation center is costly and since she has no insurance, all costs will come out of pocket.We are a humble working family and do not have the funds to pay such costs, but we believe in God and in miracles and we want to give her the best chance at survival. The elderly have suffered the most during this pandemic and we will not give up on her life just because of her age.Due to the current hospital protocols, we have only been able to see her twice. Two days ago, her oldest daughter was able to get special permission to see her, and she asked Mrs. Antonia to nod her head if she recognized her and she nodded her head yes---she was conscious and responding! The daughter asked her “ do you feel strong enough to fight this and continue to be with us?” and she nodded yes! The daughter told her we would do all we can.Any contributions will help us get Mrs. Antonia out of the hospital and into a rehabilitation center so she can get the best care and return with her family. We thank you very much for any contribution with all our heart and God bless you all.Read more"

Unfortunately, the time has come for his friends and loved ones to return that dedication to help Rob and his family.On December 19th, Rob was at home enjoying his family on holiday break when he started having neck pain which quickly turned into the loss of feeling in his legs. After being rushed to the hospital, Rob was diagnosed with an extremely rare case of MRSA infection in his spine. He had emergency surgery to remove an abscess and piece of his bone to relieve the pressure. Due to the infection, he is currently paralyzed from his chest down and unable to breathe on his own without the help of a ventilator. He recently had another surgery to transition to a tracheotomy.Rob is still in the Intensive Care Unit, but will be transferred to a spinal rehabilitation center for his long journey of recovery. The doctors are confident that his feeling will return in a few months, but he will need to learn to walk again which will be a long process.Rob has a sweet family who could use our help. His wife Mika is caring for their two children, Jackson (4) and Carson (1) until Rob is healthy enough to return home. Because of the length of the recovery, Rob's family will encounter high medical expenses as well as the ongoing finances of raising a family. There is also the uncertainty of his long term return to work.Although Rob has a tremendous support system from Mika's parents and his mother Emily, the money raised through this fund from friends and loved ones will be used towards the countless medical bills and general support for his family while he is out of work.Since Rob is in a tough position, we know that he will greatly appreciate any amount of help for his family through this hardtime.

We have been positively overwhelmed by our new friends in Australia already providing help, but also by people we didn’t know, from all over the world, offering to help. In response, we have set up this fund. Melina is 34 years old and 6 months pregnant with our second child. She had an undiagnosed brain tumour that caused an unexpected and major bleed to her brain and according to medical opinion, is most likely to result in severe disability. Currently, Melina and our baby are fighting for their lives in an intensive care unit in a specialised hospital. Your generosity will help with the anticipated family costs associated with our response to this tragedy relating to: transport and accommodation, psychological and extensive child care for our 3 year old son and the newborn baby, long-term rehabilitation for Melina, specialist transport and living solutions needed for her predicted severely disabled state, alternative treatments available privately, and unpaid leave from work. Below Melina’s friends tell her story from their hearts. Everyone who met Dawid and Melina knows what a wonderful couple they are, caring and kind. Melina is the most wonderful mother to her son Tiago (3yo) and she is currently 28 weeks pregnant with a baby boy. They moved to NSW, Australia in April 2018 with the hope of building a beautiful future and very quickly they won the hearts of the Australian people they have met. The only family they have in Australia is Melina’s sister Natalia, who until this tragedy occurred was working and studying in Melbourne. The rest of the immediate family is in Europe or Colombia. On Tuesday February 5th 2019 , Melina collapsed at home with a severe pain in her head. Shortly after she was taken in ambulance to a local hospital, where she was quickly helicoptered to a specialist hospital in Sydney. There she had an emergency operation to remove a part of the skull and reduce the swelling caused by the internal bleed. From the outset doctors did not give Melina much chance to survive the initial operation. Not only did she survive the operations but is also showing remarkable and rapid recovery against the odds. Nonetheless, the neurologists believe the overall situation is extremely precarious as the large brain tumour deep in her brain is yet to be removed. Many serious complications for their significantly premature baby are likely. As Dawid and Melina have family and friends all over the world wanting to help, we thought to raise some money to help alleviate the unexpected expenses and to lift at least one of their burdens during this extremely difficult time. Melina is one of the strongest women we know and if we can make this fight a little bit easier, we are going to do whatever we can for her, Dawid, and their boys' future. Tiago, Dawid and the baby are Melina’s pride and joy and her family, her everything. Most importantly we ask you to keep on praying and sending positive thoughts. Melina is defying the odds but her life is in a severe danger. We are sure her improvements well above doctors expectations are partly to her spirit and partly your prayers and support.

I am Originally from Co. Longford, Son of Padraig & Norleen Farrell brother of Grace, Maruna and Lillian from Lisduff, Longford. I have created this Go Fund Me to help support my Brother-in-law Jason Kenna, His wife Lillian and two sons Ryan (18) and Roman (11).On Friday the 26th of October 2018 Jason suffered a life changing stroke at the age of just 48 years old. He was diagnosed with having a Basilar Artery Occlusion causing a significant clot causing a cerebellum stroke on both sides of his brain. Jason incurred further serious medical issues as a direct result of the stroke, requiring intensive care treatment. He was not given a successful prognosis and had two near death experiences whilst in intensive care in Beaumont Hospital. Dublin. Jason’s family, his wife and two young boys were told to prepare themselves to say goodbye to their father. His determination and outright love for his family and his incredulous positivity pulled him through what were the darkest hours for the Kenna family.Due to the nature of Jason’s stroke in the Cerebellum region and medical complications he experienced, he has suffered significant balance issues. His brain stem was also compromised resulting in swallow difficulties and lung issues amongst others. Jason was halted in his rehabilitation whilst in the National Rehabilitation hospital, Dún Laoghaire, Dublin because of additional complications requiring further intensive care treatment; this significantly delayed Jason’s in his treatment and he regressed in any progress he had made prior to his in patient stay in St. Vincent’s hospital.After approximately ten months in various hospitals in Dublin and their home county of Co. Wexford; Beaumont Hospital Dublin, Wexford General Hospital, St. Vincent’s Hospital, Dublin, St. John’s Hospital, Enniscorthy and the National Rehabilitation Hospital, Dún Laoghaire, Dublin, Jason returned home to his family on the 8th of August 2019 and he commenced his rehabilitation with the aid of local health care providers. His progress was and is slow and steady however COVID-19 and the inability to access services has been detrimental to Jason’s treatment. As you can appreciate, Jason requires extensive Rehabilitation including Physiotherapy and Speech Therapy to assist him with walking, balance, and coordination. As Jason’s speech is slurred as a direct symptom of his brain injury, he will require intense specialized speech therapy for Cerebellum stroke victims. Jason’s Goal is to Attend Physiotherapy & speech therapy four times a week for the next two years, with the hope of getting his life back. He has fought so very hard against all adversity and we know this is due to his family. Jason deserves to be able to get back to some degree of independence so that he can once again enjoy life, doing the simple mundane tasks. Jason trained and studied for three years to become an Audiologist; he was scheduled to graduate from college just two days after he suffered this life changing stroke. As any young man, Jason is determined to get back to work to provide for his family and anybody who knows him will tell you how positive he is. His positivity never waivers nor does his outright belief that he will walk again and live the life that he fought so hard for. Currently Jason’s wife Lillian is his full-time career and is determined to help him through this recovery process. We are asking for help to cover the cost of his Physiotherapy l and speech therapy. We have two specialists ready to assist Jason with this monumental effort. Any donation to this cause is possibly life changing for Jason and his family. I have set out Jason’s story for you below if you would like to take the time to read it. I will update everybody on Jason’s progress and his treatment plan and any donation big or small is greatly received. On New Year’s Eve 2020 Jason, his wife, his two boys and his extended family made a wish and placed their intentions in a bottle. I did not need to ask them what they all wished for and I hope by facilitating this treatment we can make these wishes come true. Thank you to everybody for your attention. Colin. Jason’s StoryJason’s life changed significantly on the morning of Friday the 26th of Octobers 2018. He woke for work as usual, arose to dress himself for what would have been another day at work as an Audiologist, he felt dizzy, speech began to slur and within minutes everything changed. Thankfully, Lillian, his wife acted with a degree of urgency and called 999. Jason was transported to Wexford General Hospital and administered clot busting medication (TPA), this quick action effectively saved Jason’s life. He was diagnosed with having suffered a Basilar Artery Occlusion which caused him to stroke his cerebellum on both sides of his brain. Jason’s speech and balance were instantly affected by this type of stroke.Following this diagnosis Jason was immediately referred to the Neurological department in Beaumont Hospital in Dublin and was admitted to a stroke ward. We were informed by the stroke specialists that stroke has a cycle of events and pressure on the brain is a possible event that we should expect. Thankfully, Jason was in the very best hospital and under the care of a fantastic team of doctors and consultants. Two days later, Jason’s condition deteriorated dramatically. Lillian received a phone call that Jason was disorientated and displaying symptoms indicative of pressure caused by fluid on the brain in the Cerebellum region. As shocking as this may sound to most, as indeed it did to us as a family; Cranial pressure is part and parcel of a stroke as the doctors had informed us. A somewhat routine cranial procedure was due to be performed which as the neurosurgeons had described, a tube would be inserted in his cranium, this fluid would be drained, and the pressure would be relieved. Later that evening Jason was transferred to theatre and the anesthetist proceeded to intubate him for the procedure. In the process, Jason vomited a significant amount of blood and bile from his stomach which aspirated into his lungs. The anesthetists had a difficult two hours trying to suction his lungs. His oxygen levels dropped dangerously low to 10% oxygen and they were regrettably unable to proceed with the procedure. Jason was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit, placed on a ventilator whilst they continued to drain his lungs and aid them to heal. The pressure on his brain continued to increase and the consultants were very concerned. We were informed that If the pressure continued, his brain stem which controls all motor function could become compressed resulting in Jason requiring full assisted treatment for life with his breathing, tube feeding and or worst-case scenario he could die. The most devastating news we could hear. Jason remained in a critical condition throughout and a second CT scan was conducted three days later, which as we feared showed that the cranial pressure was increasing. Jason had pneumonia and a significant amount of fluid on his lungs. The surgeons and consultants knew they had to try the cranial procedure again, for as we were informed if they do not release the pressure he will die and if they proceed with the procedure and he aspirates again he could die. There was no other choice but to proceed as we had to fight as did Jason.A second attempt was made, and Jason was again intubated for the procedure and once again he began to aspirate, and his stats dropped rapidly. The team of anesthetists returned to the family room a short time later and informed us of their unsuccessful second attempt. Jason began to smother in his own fluid, he required suctioning of his lungs again and they thankfully managed to return him to a somewhat stable condition. The consultants further informed us that based on the previous two attempts it will be far too dangerous to intubate Jason due to his impaired lungs. We did not think things could get any worse. All we could do now was hope and pray. The medical team spoke to the family and told us that we needed to prepare ourselves to say goodbye. Jason was not promised tomorrow or even the next hour at that point. On Halloween night when all children should be out trick or treating, Jason’s two sons then 15 and 9 years old prepared to see their daddy in intensive care for the first time to say their goodbyes. A photograph of Jason, Lillian and his boys sat over his bed. When his boys arrived, Jason’s eyes creeped open and he squeezed their hands. We urged him to fight for his boys and for their future life as a family however we afforded him peace to let go If that is what he chose to do. Jason chose to fight and that he did. Jason made it through the night, and we received our first glimmer of hope. The stroke consultant informed the family that it had been five days since the pressure began and sometimes the pressure can stop increasing on day five and potentially subside. However, the next day we were informed that the pressure did not subside. The team had decided that given Jason’s young age, they needed to try the procedure again and hope that his lungs had improved enough to allow intubation to be successful. Jason was wheeled to theatre and our family waited and prayed. The team prepared us that Jason would be in a coma for five days post procedure if he pulls through and the bone at the back of Jason’s skull would have to be removed, a procedure known as a craniotomy. They mentioned this bone can be inserted into his stomach and harvested there if they need to replace the bone at a later day, an option that Jason did not need to avail of. A team of doctors, anesthetists and consultants arrived at intensive care to wheel him down to theatre. They allowed my sisters Lillian and Grace to remain with him until the very end, a very finite and painful moment. At approximately 8pm that evening Jason was wheeled back to the intensive care unit by only one porter, such a contrasting image from a few hours previous. The family finally exhaled, took a breath, and hoped for good news. Jason improved dramatically despite the extent of his condition and one week later he was discharged from the Intensive Care Unit and he returned to the ward. Jason was discharged from Beaumont hospital three weeks later and sent to Wexford General Hospital for further medical care and then onto St. John’s Hospital in Enniscorthy, Co. Wexford where he commenced Physiotherapy, Speech & Occupational Therapy. Jason continued his rehabilitation in the National Rehabilitation Centre (NRH) in Dún Laoghaire where he remained for approximately twelve weeks. Jason was receiving intense physiotherapy, water & music therapy, Occupational & Speech Therapy which he thoroughly enjoyed. As a result of the stroke Jason suffers with severe balance issues and must learn to walk, talk, and do all the simple daily tasks such as holding a knife and fork, writing his name, and improving his slurred speech. He must effectively learn to do everything again, all the simple tasks that we take for granted.Jason was making great progress in the NRH when he suddenly became very ill and was transferred to St. Vincent’s Hospital, Dublin Emergency Department. Jason’s lungs were collapsing, and he was transferred again to the Intensive Care Unit; our hearts sank. Jason was placed on a ventilator and we were told to prepare ourselves for the worst. Jason the ultimate fighter that he is, pulled through and after almost one month in St. Vincent’s hospital he was transferred back to the National Rehabilitation Hospital, Dún Laoghaire. Jason was extremely weak; he was tube fed and any progress he had made in his rehabilitation was significantly set back. This was a very difficult situation for Jason to deal with as apparently the six months of rehabilitation post stroke are very important for the patient in allowing them to make solid lasting and sustainable progress. At present Jason is trying his very best to regain his mobility. He takes it day by day, with effort and dedication however he has huge challenges ahead both physically and mentally, challenges that we hope can be assisted with your gracious help.I know Jason, Lillian, Ryan and Roman are forever grateful.Read more"

With the exceptional care that he is receiving at MGH, and the fact that Deane is such a fighter, Rachel is confident that this will be possible._____From Rachel:Hi all, I need to tell the story of Deane on his behalf, and let everyone know what he did. While the way the fire started was a freak accident, Deane risking his life to minimize the damaging explosion was no accident. Deane selflessly put himself in harm's way to make sure that no one else was hurt. He put his hands in the flames of the burning gas canister and dispersed the gas on the lawn preventing a significantly larger explosion which would have cost lives and even greater property and environmental damage. He didn't hesitate and he didn't run. He is not the victim of a tragic accident. He is my superhero.He saved my life. He saved our dog, our friends, our home, the forest beside it, and the neighbors' homes. In doing so, he got gas all over him and was then in flames. His sacrifice spared us a much more devastating outcome all at his own cost. Once we were able to put the fire out that was all over hisbody, he got up and tried to help put the rest of the fire out. His clothes had been burned off him, his body was very badly burned, and he was definitely in shock. The whole time he kept saying to me, ""I'm so sorry baby. I love you so much. I'm sorry baby, are you OK? I love you so much.""He is amazing and he is the strongest person I've evermet. He is in the care of the best burn center in the world. And he is fighting. Please continue to send prayers, good thoughts or whatever other positivity you're inspired to send to him. We could use it and are immensely grateful for any and all of your support.Thank you and stay safe.Read more"

It only affects the nerves enervating his lower muscles, and he has been able to learn how to walk with a lot of PT training and hard effort on his part. Alec wears AFO leg braces, but despite this, his muscles are often tight and painful. This affects his balance and coordination and he sometimes falls. Unfortunately, over time the spasticity and tightness of his muscles will take their toll on his body, causing Alec chronic pain from joint arthritis. Years later, he could lose his mobility and need to use canes or a walker.After a year of research into possible treatments and conversation with expert doctors at the St. Louis Children's Hospital , our little Alec was accepted for a life changing surgery called Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy to permanently treat his cerebral palsy.￼￼We’ve been told Alec is an ideal candidate for SDR and that he may benefit greatly from it. The procedure involves probing and cutting some of the misfiring nerves in the spinal cord that contribute to spasticity in Alec’s legs. Enough healthy nerves are left intact so that he will be able to walk more easily. We are preparing to go out to St. Louis at the end of October for his November 1st surgery. Although we have employer-provided health insurance, the plan we are on will not cover the year of intensive therapy Alec will require after the procedure to retrain his “new legs” to walk. We are also anticipating travel costs, as well as income lost from time Jon will need to take off in order to chaperone Alec to his therapy sessions every day.￼￼Choosing elective spine surgery for our child has felt at times like an impossible decision to make. But we are confident that it will dramatically improve Alec’s life for decades to come. Any help you can give Alec to get the treatment he needs will be greatly appreciated. Thank you all so much.￼￼The ScienceAlec has spastic diplegia cerebral palsy that causes tightness and motor control disruption in his leg and core muscles. In the past, Alec has undergone Botox and phenol injections (6 times) to mitigate the effects of this excess spasticity. For the past year we have been researching Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy surgery, a permanent way of reducing spasticity, and Alec has been selected as an ideal candidate for this surgery. The surgeon will open up a 1-2 incision along his spine and, during a 4-hour surgery, go nerve-by-nerve to test and cut only the nerve rootlets that cause the spasticity in his legs. The ideal time to do this surgery is before age 7 so we have decided to go forward with the procedure at the best facility in the world for this type of surgery in St. Louis, MO. Alec will remain in the hospital for one week in St. Louis, and we are also exploring staying on through the end of the second week for additional physical therapy with the St. Louis team before we return home. Once back to New York, Alec will be either recovering at home or at an inpatient pediatric rehab facility. Alec will need to relearn how to use his ""new legs"" and body. Physical therapy is very important post-surgery: 4-5x weekly for the first 6 months, 3-4x weekly for the next 6 months and then 1-2x weekly for the next year or two after that. Our preference is for Alec to recover and rest at home with Mom and Dad taking him to his PT sessions. However, due to insurance limitations on physical therapy sessions, we may need to admit him in-patient for a couple of weeks (although we are trying to avoid this route). Since the SDR surgery is permanent and will remove most (if not all) of the excess spasticity, Alec will no longer need Botox injections, and will be saved from a lifetime of pain and potentially reduced mobility over time due to the debilitating effects on joints and bones that this excess spasticity can cause as Alec grows. He will have improved gait function, balance and endurance. Oxygen studies show how much additional oxygen and energy children with CP consume to keep up with their peers on a daily basis, which leaves them more tired for physical and mental activities. SDR should help alleviate this for Alec as well.As you can understand, we are extremely nervous and extremely excited to take this giant step into the unknown. We have been fortunate to speak with many parents who have had children undergo SDR. None have expressed any regret for their decision, and have urged us to be brave and do whatever it takes to provide Alec with the surgery and rehabilitation.Read more"

On October 11th, Andrew was helping his in-laws trim a tree, fainted on a ladder, and fell backwards, suffering a severe and complete injury to his spinal cord at T6 (thoracic) vertebrae. He has undergone emergency surgery to stabilize his spinal fractures - unfortunately he cannot feel or move his legs. Thankfully he has use of his upper body. The neurosurgeon has told him that most recovery of function happens in the first 6 months. Andrew was fortunate to spend six weeks at Craig Spinal Rehabilitation Hospital in Denver, Colorado, one of the best dedicated spinal injury rehab centers in the country.   Andrew is well-known and loved in the Taos community for his unwavering willingness and generosity to help others with whatever they may need, whether it be working on their car, baling hay, working in the acequias/fields, or volunteering at his kids' school. He is a family man, and has been married for 20 years to Jessie, who was born and raised in Taos. Together they are raising their 3 children Louis(16), Violet(12), and Jane(9 yrs) along with a host of chickens, cats, and horses in Taos. Over the years, Andrew has contributed and coached teams for Taos Youth Soccer, helped with cross-country practice, and spoken to school students about career choices. He is an avid runner, loves the mountains, and has participated in many benefit races in Taos for good causes.  As many of you know, Andrew was in great physical shape prior to the accident, and that combined with his positive outlook on life, along with his family's support and never-ending love, gives him the best shot at recovering some function in his legs. It will be a long and difficult road to recovery for Andrew, not only the physical and mental aspect, but financially. The helicopter flight, emergency surgery, hospitalization at UNM, and future rehabilitation costs will quickly add-up. Your generous donation will go completely to Jessie and the kids, so they can focus on being with Andrew during his rehab, help with his medical costs, and make any modifications needed to their house for when he finally is able to return home! Any amount you can afford to donate is so greatly appreciated!  If you cannot donate, please keep Andrew and his family in your thoughts and prayers, and please share this GoFundMe page with anyone you know and on social media to help spread the word. So as not to overwhelm Jessie with messages and phone calls, please leave a positive sentiment and well-wishes via this GoFundMe page with your donation!       Together we can do this for them! Thank You so much!***UPDATE 11/14/2020: Andrew is currently entering his 4th week of specialized rehabilitation at Craig Hospital in Englewood, CO. He is anticipated to return to Taos in early December, he is adjusting and making progress, please read the updates below for more specific details, and continue to have Andrew and his family in your thoughts and prayers.***UPDATE 12/7/2020: Andrew continues to adjust to maneuvering in a wheelchair for now. He is set to finish his time at Craig Hospital and transition to a week of outpatient setting in Denver. Then if all goes well, home to Taos for the holidays with his family by mid-December! Please continue to keep him and family in your thoughts and prayers. See 'UPDATES' tab for more specific details on progress by Andrew.

Harry is recovering from a tragic event in Afghanistan on October 21, 2015. Harry was there as a contractor with a U.S. national defense agency and stepped on a land mine; as a result of the explosion, he lost both of his legs and suffered a broken pelvis and internal injuries. Yet as with his prior 23 year career as a US Navy SEAL, Harry continues to exhibit a no quit, only move forward attitude that is a source of incredible inspiration.The campaign was initiated on November 1, 2015 by CBRE | Hampton Roads as part of its annual “No Shave November” effort. That initial “Get Hairy for Harry” campaign ended on November 30, 2015 with $116,255 raised ! That money will be put to good use to help in his recovery and rehabilitation at home after he is released from the military hospitals; while his care to date has been excellent and paid for by the government, there are expected to be gaps in coverage for care beyond his actual hospital bills while he learns to get back on his “new feet”.Harry has requested that the GoFundMe site be kept open after December 1, 2015 so that he can stay in touch with those that have supported him already and so that he has somewhere to refer people in the future who say they would like to help also. All funds raised after December 1, 2015 will continue to help Harry provide financial support for his family.Harry and his wife Julie have 2 young daughters enrolled in Virginia colleges (one at JMU and one at Virginia Wesleyan).  Harry is working now with his medical team to get stronger and be in position to be transferred in early 2016 from Walter Reed to the Center for the Intrepid in Fort Sam Houston, Texas.

He sustained a very, very severe level of trauma and had to be taken to a nearby Level 1 Trauma Center in Loveland, CO. He is currently unconscious and has been since the accident.He has been in and out of surgery several times as his medical team tries to stabilize him and begins to sort out the damage he sustained. His left leg is broken in three places and his left femur was driven up into his hip socket. Due to the nature of the impact, his pelvis has multiple major fractures. He also has significant trauma to his abdominal organs including his liver, spleen, kidneys, and pancreas. This is all on top of internal abdominal bleeding and two brain hemorrhages.His medical team is doing an amazing job taking care of the immediate damage but this is going to be a very long road for Josh and for everyone supporting him. Right now he is in rough shape: intubated, under sedation, in traction for his leg, and undergoing daily surgeries. Moving forward there’s going to be several months of hospital stays for him along with further surgeries followed by intensive therapy and rehabilitation. The doctors estimate it is going to be at least a year before we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel for Josh’s recovery.We, his family and his friends, have been overwhelmed with the outpouring of love and prayers for Josh's healing. It is humbling to know how many people Josh has touched. Thank you all for being so willing to do whatever is needed to support Josh. Right now contributing financially is the best way to do that.Everything you can donate will be used to help support Josh and those caring for him. Our mother, Leialoha, will be staying at his bedside in Colorado for the foreseeable future. We are humbly asking for any help you can give us to cover the expenses related to Josh's recovery over the next year. The money raised will assist us in paying Josh's medical costs as well as his other “normal” bills (rent/phone/car payments/etc.) since he will not be able to work. We are also hoping to purchase a used car for Leialoha to commute to the hospital.

Honey Bun is a world famous pangolin and she needs you!

Rare and Endangered Species Trust, or 'REST', have been working tirelessly for many years to conserve Namibia's most endangered species. Part of this work is taking in animals, including pangolins, that need veterinary care and rehabilitation. Out in Namibia the equipment and medical testing available is often limited and can require extensive travel to obtain. This limitation and struggle has only been made worse recently by the COVID-19 pandemic and the REST team are finding themselves reliant on human medical resources for processes such as blood testing which, although helpful, are not ideal for animal treatment.

THE SOLUTION: REST need their own sophisticated veterinary equipment, such as a chemical analyzer for blood tests and other diagnostics, right there on site to be able to undergo testing ASAP saving precious time and reducing stress to the animal caused by travel. This is fundamental to the treatment of so many different species but RIGHT NOW there is a pangolin called Honey Bun (you might have heard of her, she's quite famous and a brilliant ambassador for her species, giver her a google!) who the team are desperately trying to save. This equipment could save Honey Bun's life, and many more like her in the future, by giving the team quicker and more in-depth answers about the potential illnesses they are dealing with. This means more appropriate treatment can be provided much faster.The team do not yet know exactly what is causing HB's illness which is why it is SO IMPORTANT they get the equipment they need to help them find out.

Through my connections, I am able to collect large quantities of masks, and this is where we need your help. These masks are not the ""N95"" masks, but they are BFE 95% protective and at least provide some coverage as a protective dust/mouth mask. And they are not free, unfortunately, but they are the most inexpensive protection we can find that is better than just a bandana or piece of cloth.We have hit our original goal of $15,000. Reached our second goal of $25,000 and now reaching towards $50,000. Help us reach out next milestone of $50,000.00. Hitting this goal would procure us over a minimum of 100,000+ masks for the medical workers on the frontline that are in dire need. The quantity has a range due to different suppliers offering different prices.As we stock the masks, we will be supplying masks as the frontline continues to help patients and fight COVID-19 with your support.HOW DO YOU HELP?3 WAYS!1.

REFER any healthcare workers, first responders, hospitals or anyone on the frontline, and they can fill out a form at the end of our campaign message or right HERE to request masksOKAY, LET'S BREAK DOWN THE DONATION PARTTo give you better insight on your monetary contribution, $5 donation = 10+ masks to frontline heroes; doctors, nurses or healthcare workers along with shipping and delivery costs. We will allocate masks to all requests from health care facilities, doctors and even small practices. We will be doing posts and requests within our network to see who needs supplies. We want to spread out the inventory based on anyone out or running low on masks. There is a form at the end of this campaign message to submit hospitals in need as well.This is going to be an ongoing battle, so your support is needed even if it was the minimum $5 donation required by GoFundMe.

Candice Sparksis currently in the battle of her life with the devastating Covid-19 virus. She just turned 40 years old this month.❤️

On January 22, she was sedated and placed on a ventilator in the Shawnee Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and is making slow progress, which means more days at the hospital and increasing medical bills.

Her family looks forward to telling her how much she is being thought of and prayed over when she wakes.

If you’d like to contribute to her medical fund, please do so here. Any amount will be greatly appreciated. She will need to continue dialysis and rehabilitation for several months once she recovers from this deadly virus.

Thank you,

Candice’s Family and Friends

When he is released, he will be living in a halfway house for two months while learning transitional techniques. Then, he will move to La Marque to live in a co-op house. While there, he will be working and taking continuing education classes at The College of the Mainland. This slow transition back into daily life will give Keith the foundation he needs to become acclimated in today’s world, which has drastically changed since Keith entered prison at the age of 17.When Keith went to prison as a teenager he was charged with murder under the “law of parties,” which states that a person can be criminally responsible for the action of another in certain circumstances. He tried to diffuse the situation and even tried to leave the fight before things transpired when his friend committed a murder. We all agree that Keith deserved prison time and now that he has served his punishment, we hope that many of you believe in rehabilitation, grace, and the gift of a second chance. Keith undoubtedly has many obstacles ahead, but we have faith in God and believe that Keith deserves the same grace that God has given us. We have seen personal, emotional, and spiritual growth that allows us to have great hope in his second chance. Keith has always had a big heart and has the likelihood of making a great life for his community and self, but will need the emotional and financial support of his friends and family through this transition.There are great financial necessities that are coming as we help Keith become a productive and employable citizen. The parole lawyer cost us 10k and took up the money we had saved for his is re-entry. We are now trying to raise money for transitional care, trade school, and transportation.Our family is very grateful for anything you can give to support Keith during this time and help him have a second chance at a successful and productive life.With love,Jennifer Grant (Keith’s Aunt)Cindy Blust (Keith’s Step Mother)Read more"

Unsure of what was wrong, we immediately called 911 and the paramedicsidentified symptoms of a stroke and rushed him to the trauma center at Capital Health in Trenton.The doctors ran tests and discovered he was paralyzed on the right side of his body for the first few days. He spent seven days in the trauma center where he underwent countless tests and procedures. The doctors have not been able to figure out what caused the stroke. In October, they transferred him to an inpatient rehab at St. Lawrence Rehabilitation Center in Lawrenceville, NJ where he spent weeks working on his recovery. He worked daily with a physical therapist, occupational therapist, and speech therapist to teach his body how to move again. Eventually they sent him home for recovery and he now goes to outpatient therapy three times a week.Before the stroke, Dylan enjoyed surfing, snowboarding, playing video games, boating with his family, and spending time down the shore with his girlfriend. Now that he has right side paralysis, he is currently unable to do many of the activities he loved doing before his stroke.He has made great progress in his recovery but still has trouble walking even with a brace on his leg. Because his right wrist is weak, daily tasks are proving to be incredibly challenging for him.He has been unable to work since September when he had the stroke. It has been a struggle to get him approved for disability, unemployment, and social security. We are looking for financial assistance to help him cover his bills and other essential items he currently cannot afford. We created this gofundme to help him financially until he can go back to work. Any support is greatly appreciated!Read more"

ANE is a rare, severe and rapidly progressing disease affecting the brain, which develops shortly after a viral infection.As you can imagine, itwas hard to process all of this information and we were all in total shock and simply devastated.   This diagnosis raises a lot of fears and concerns as you can imagine.

Matt saw a car in the median that was on fire, so he stopped his vehicle to help. At that point, Matt realized the driver was trapped inside her car and as he tried to assist her, was struck by another car speeding through the intersection that didn’t see the accident. Matt's left leg below his knee was crushed and the force of the car placed Matt two lanes over on the street.Luckily, another Good Samaritan came to Matt's aid, and with the help of her and another man, a tourniquet was tied around his leg until the paramedics arrived. Due to this accident, Brother Matt's left leg had to be amputated midway between the foot and the knee. Matt is lucky to be alive today and when you talk with him, he has no regrets, and stopped because in Matt's words, ""that’s who I am"". In order to offset his medical bills and rehabilitation efforts, we are asking every person and Company to be as generous as possible and donate.

Ik heb 8 jaar geleden hersenletsel opgelopen toen ik mijn hoofd stootte tegen een houten balk. Hierdoor kan ik niet werken, weinig sociale activiteiten doen en kan ik niet meedoen met het gezin zoals ik zou willen. In het begin heb ik nauwelijks begeleiding gehad bij mijn herstel, maar 2 jaar terug ben ik het revalidatietraject ingegaan. Na dit traject is het maximum behaald dat in Nederland te behalen valt bij niet aan geboren hersenletsel, ik ben uitbehandeld. Leren omgaan en accepteren van alle gevolgen van het hersenletsel is de boodschap. In Amerika is er een kliniek die speciaal voor mensen met deze klachten een behandeling hebben ontwikkeld; Cognitive FX in Utah. Zij gebruiken een functionele MRI-scan om te bepalen welke gebieden overprikkeld zijn en waar meer activiteit zou mogen zijn. Hierop wordt een behandelplan gemaakt en zullen mijn hersenen flink aan de bak moeten, door middel van verschillende therapieën. Omdat deze behandeling nog niet wetenschappelijk is onderbouwd, is er geen vergoeding mogelijk via de zorgverzekering. De resultaten zijn zo goed, een gemiddelde van 70% verbetering van de klachten na de behandeling, dat 95% van de behandelde patiënten een aanzienlijke verbetering aangeven na de behandeling. Hieronder heb ik enkele links over de behandeling en aandacht op tv voor niet aangeboren hersenletsel.Informatie over de behandelingen en de resultaten bij Cognitive FX: LINKUitzending dokters van morgen: LINKEva Jinek heeft ook aandacht besteed aan Cognitive FX, bekijk hier het fragment: LINK De kosten van deze behandeling, met vervoer- en verblijfskosten, liggen rond de 15.000,- euro. Dit bedrag hebben wij niet zomaar liggen. Daarom vraag ik jullie om hulp om te doneren.Waarom doneren?· Omdatik erin geloof dat de behandeling in Amerika mij zal helpen om mijn klachten aanzienlijk te verminderen.· Omdat ik na deze behandeling weer met mijn kinderen mee kan naar hun sport, kan helpen op school, of mee naar een pretpark kan. · Zodat ik weer kan werken, weer mee kan draaien in de maatschappij. · Zodat ik mijzelf kan zijn; vrolijk, positief en vol energie. · Omdat ik niet wil en kan geloven dat ik de rest van mijn leven thuis moet zitten en alle activiteiten af moet wegen.

Doneren mag natuurlijk ook anoniem, alvast enorm bedankt voor jullie bijdrage en medeleven!PS: Mocht er na het behandeltraject geld over blijven, dan zal ik het restant doneren aan een volgende patiënt die ook naar Utah zou willen voor een behandeling.Hieronder heb ik mijn verhaal opgeschrevenHelp mij mijn pijnvrije dinsdag te krijgenIk ben Stephanie Langejans (36 jaar).

Ik ben van nature een positief en vrolijk ingesteld persoon, maar dat wordt mij door mijn hersenletsel nogal moeilijk gemaakt. Wat er gebeurdeIn 2012 heb ik hersenletsel opgelopen doordat ik heel hard met mijn hoofd tegen een houten balk ben gebotst tijdens het bed opmaken. Het is geen spannend ongeluk, waardoor de weekendhuisarts op de post ook verwachtte dat mijn klachten dinsdag weer over zouden zijn, ondanks dat ik onze zoon aan de overkant van de eettafel niet meer helder in beeld kon krijgen (en wij hebben geen bijzonder grote eettafel). Na 8 jaar weet ik wel beter dan dat deze dinsdag er niet uit zichzelf gaat komen. BehandelingIn eerste instantie was er geen behandeling en de specialist zei dat er zoveel mensen waren met hoofdpijn, duizeligheid, moeheid et cetera en dat ik daar maar aan moest wennen. Huilend verliet ik het ziekenhuis. Wat voelden wij ons machteloos. Ondanks alles hebben wij ons als gezin, met de hulp van onze lieve familie, echt geprobeerd om alles zo normaal mogelijk door te laten gaan en om met alle klachten om te gaan. Toen ik steeds slechter ging zien, overdag in slaap ging vallen en voortdurend hoofdpijn bleef houden, heb ik toch weer aan de bel getrokken bij de huisarts. Zij begreep mijn verhaal en kwam als eerste met de noemer NIET AANGEBOREN HERSENLETSTEL. Ik werd doorverwezen naar de revalidatiearts waar ik enorm fijn geholpen werd door de arts, ergotherapeut en de psycholoog. De behandeling bestond uit het leren accepteren en omgaan met alle klachten die ik ervaar. De behandeling verliep voorspoedig, maar het maximum was bereikt. Ik ben uitbehandeld, verbetering wordt niet meer verwacht. (Alternatieve) therapieënIn de loop van de jaren heb ik van alles geprobeerd om ook maar een beetje verlichting te krijgen van mijn klachten. Chiropractie, osteopathie, fysiotherapie, craniosacraaltherapie, mesologie, optometrist, oogarts, maar ook een kno-arts vanwege oor- en holteontstekingen en een diëtist vanwege darmproblemen. Iedereen heeft echt zijn best gedaan om mij te helpen, en soms had ik wat verlichting van mijn klachten, maar hier was ook de boodschap dat het maximum haalbare was bereikt. KlachtenIk sta elke dag op met forse hoofdpijn en moeheid, het voelt alsof ik nog maar net een paar uur heb geslapen. In de loop van de dag nemen de klachten toe, de mate waarin het toeneemt is ook afhankelijk van wat ik doe. Wanneer ik veel geluid, drukte of licht om mij heen heb, wanneer ik uit balans kom (geen trampoline voor mij), bij langer dan een kwartier lezen, bij bukken, autorijden, het huishouden doen, kortom bij heel veel activiteiten nemen de klachten al snel toe. Dit heeft natuurlijk een groot effect op het gezin. Ik slaap tussen de middag, anders worden de enthousiaste verhalen van school van de jongens mij al te veel, tijdens een kopje thee. Mijn zicht is niet optimaal, het focussen is lastig, en ik zie altijd stippeltjes in mijn beeld (zoals het sneeuwbeeld op de televisie van vroeger). HoopToen ik bij de verzekeringsarts van het UWV was, attendeerde hij mij op het programma dokters van morgen. Hij zei: ‘Stephanie, jij zou naar Amerika moeten. Zij kunnen jou wel helpen.’ Dat wekte natuurlijk onze interesse en wij zijn gaan kijken naar het programma en op de website van Cognitive FX in Utah. Zij hebben een behandeling ontwikkeld waarbij de hersenen worden getraind op een betere manier van werken, zodat het brein gaat werken op een manier die mij weinig klachten geeft. De resultaten zijn zo positief, dat ik weer durf te gaan hopen dat ik niet mijn hele leven thuis hoef te zitten en alle activiteiten hoef af te wegen om maar niet overprikkeld te raken. Doordat ik contact heb met een aantal mensen die mij zijn voorgegaan, en zelfs al met hele positieve resultaten zijn teruggekeerd uit Utah, ben ik nog veel hoopvoller gestemd dat deze behandeling mij ook heel veel goed zal doen. Wat zijn er al veel mensen uit Nederland mij voorgegaan! Het is echt ongelooflijk hoeveel mensen uit moeten wijken naar Amerika om te mogen herstellen van hersenletsel. Donderdag 23 januari 2020 heb ik een intakegesprek gehad, nadat wij een hele vragenlijst hadden doorlopen, met de behandelaars in Utah. Zij vinden mij een hele geschikte kandidaat voor hun programma en verwachten dat ik zeker in de categorie van 70% verbetering zal ga vallen. WensWat zou ik graag weer naar een feestje kunnen gaan, naar een concert of pretpark met onze kinderen, lekker uitgebreid muziek maken of gewoon een hele dag genieten, of heerlijk een boek lezen, zonder dat ik daar een lange poos nog veel meer klachten van heb en heel lang bij moet slapen. Ik zou het ook heerlijk vinden om weer te kunnen gaan werken, om het financieel voor ons thuis een stuk gemakkelijker te maken. Wie weet kunnen wij dan zelfs gaan sparen voor een mooie buscamper! Ik zou het zelfs fijn vinden om zelf weer het hele huis schoon te kunnen maken. Het is zo vervelend dat Martijn, naast zijn werk, ook nog het huishouden moet doen. Hij stofzuigt, dweilt, doet de boodschappen, wast de ramen, alle zwaardere klussen komen op zijn schouders. Ik houd het afstoffen (meestal) bij en doe de was en de wc’s, maar dat is voor mij een weektaak en is weer een reden om te moeten gaan rusten. Koken lukt ook niet altijd, hoewel de kinderen dan niet klagen, gelukkig is patat in de actifry snel gemaakt. Dit kan natuurlijk niet te vaak, want de gezondheid van iedereen in het gezin staat voorop. De kinderenWat ik heel zwaar vind, is dat de kinderen altijd proberen rekening te houden met mij. Ze proberen niet te veel lawaai te maken, maar probeer dat eens tijdens een nerfgevecht waarbij de pijltjes om de oren vliegen. Zij hebben er echt last van dat ik niet veel kan hebben. Ze maken zich dan ook zorgen over mama. De kinderen kennen mij niet als de vrolijke energieke Stephanie van vroeger. Een paar klasgenootjes van Nils en de Godsdienstjuf vertelden dat Nils, al zeker een jaar lang, elke woensdag een kaarsje voor mij opsteekt in de klas, omdat hij zo graag zou willen dat mama weer beter wordt. Als extra positief punt voert hij aan dat ik, wanneer ik beter ben, ook weer aan het werk kan, zodat hij en zijn broer dan een mooie moutainbike kunnen gaan kopen.Sven vindt het vooral fijn dat ik beter zou worden en dan bijvoorbeeld mee kan naar een concert, hoewel ik een vermoeden heb dat mijn hoofd nooit goed tegen zijn heavy metal muziek zal kunnen. SlotconclusieDe conclusie van mijn verhaal is dat ik zo graag weer mijn leven terug wil, en dat wij denken en geloven dat dit mogelijk is door de therapie die in Utah wordt aangeboden. Wat zal de kwaliteit van leven van het hele gezin erop vooruit gaan als er niemand meer rekening hoeft te houden met de klachten die ontstaan bij elk geluidje en alle, zo op het oog normale, activiteiten. Wat zou het fijn zijn om weer een sociaal leven te kunnen hebben en gewoon naar die drukke verjaardag te kunnen gaan, zelf weer lekker muziek te kunnen maken en het 's avonds maar zo een keertje heel laat te kunnen maken, zonder dat daar weer een paar hele slechte dagen of zelfs weken tegenover staan. Wat lijkt het mij heerlijk om 's morgens uitgerust wakker te worden en energiek te kunnen bedenken wat ik vandaag voor dingen zal gaan doen, in plaats van mezelf uit bed te slepen en in elk geval proberen om zoveel mogelijk dingen thuis rond te krijgen en daarna weer in mijn bed te kruipen om daarvan uit te kunnen rusten. Wat zou het fijn zijn als jullie mij willen steunen door geld te doneren om dit mogelijk te maken. Ik wil iedereen dan ook enorm bedanken voor het lezen van mijn verhaal, voor het medeleven en hopelijk ook voor de donaties! English versionBrain injury: help me to Cognitive fx UtahI'm Stephanie Langejans (36 years old). I suffered brain injury 8 years ago when I hit my head against a wooden beam. As a result, I cannot work, do few social activities and I cannot join the family as I would like.In the beginning I hardly had any guidance with my recovery, but 2 years ago I started the rehabilitation process. After this trajectory, the maximum has been achieved in the Netherlands in this case of post concussion syndrome for which the treatment has been finisched. Learning to handle and accept all the consequences of brain injury is the final message. They can’t do anything more.In America there is a clinic that has developed treatment especially for people with these complaints; Cognitive FX in Utah. They use a functional MRI scan to determine which areas are over-stimulated and where more activity should be. A treatment plan is made based on this and my brains will have to work hard through various therapies.Because this treatment is not yet scientifically substantiated, no reimbursement is possible through the health insurance. The results are so good, an average of 70% improvement in post-treatment complaints, that 95% of treated patients report a significant improvement after treatment.Down below some links with information about the treatment and attention on TV for non-congenital brain injury.Information about Cognitive FX treatments and results: LINK Broadcast doctors of tomorrow: LINKEva Jinek has also paid attention to Cognitive FX, view the broadcast here: LINKThe costs of this treatment, with transport and accommodation costs, are around 15,000 euros.We don't just have this amount. That is why I am asking you for help and donation.Why donate?• Because I believe that treatment in America will help me to significantly reduce my symptoms.• Because after this treatment I can take my children back to their sport, help at school, or go to an amusement park.• So that I can work again, participate in society again.• So that I can be myself; cheerful, positive and full of energy.• Because I don't want to and cannot believe that I have to sit at home for the rest of my life and weigh all activities.How can you donate?- Click on the Donate button (you can pay with your credit card or via Ideal)- If you would like to wire directly, please contact me for my bank details or paypal details.Donations can of course also be made anonymously, thanks in advance for your contribution and compassion!PS: If there is money left over after the treatment process, I shall donate the remaining money to another patient who would also like to go to Utah for treatment.I have written down my story belowHelp me get my pain-free TuesdayI'm Stephanie Langejans (36 years old). I have been married to Martijn for 11 years. We have 2 sons: Sven, 10 years old, and Nils, 8 years old (almost 9 years old, of course I have to tell you that). I am a positive and cheerful person by nature, but my brain injury makes that rather difficult. What happenedIn 2012 I suffered a brain injury because I bumped my head very hard against a wooden beam while making the bed. It is not an exciting accident, so the weekend general practitioner at the post also expected my complaints would be resolved on Tuesday, despite the fact that I could no longer get a clear picture of our son across the dining table (and we do not have a particularly large dining table) . After 8 years I know better than that this Tuesday will not happen by itself.TherapyAt first there was no treatment and the specialist said that there were so many people with headache, dizziness, fatigue, etc., that I just had to get used to it. I left the hospital crying. We felt helpless. In spite of everything, we as a family, with the help of our dear family, really tried to keep everything going as normal as possible and we had to deal with all the complaints.When I started to see worse, fell asleep during the day and kept having a headache, I still sounded the bell again at the doctor. She understood my story and was the first to come up with the term post concussion syndrome (acquired brain injury). I was referred to the rehabilitation doctor where I was helped enormously by the doctor, occupational therapist and the psychologist. The treatment consisted of learning to accept and deal with all complaints that I experienced. The treatment went well, but the maximum was reached. I have been treated, improvement was no longer expected.(Alternative) therapiesOver the years I have tried everything to get a little relief from my complaints. Chiropractic, osteopathy, physiotherapy, craniosacral therapy, mesology, optometrist, ophthalmologist, but also an ENT doctor for ear and cavity infections and a dietician for bowel problems.Everyone really did their best to help me, and sometimes I had some relief from my complaints, but here was also the message that the maximum was achieved.ComplaintsI get up every day with a big headache and tiredness, it feels like I have just slept for a few hours. The complaints increase during the day, the extent to which it increases also depends on what I do. When I have a lot of noise, bustle or light around me, when I am out of balance (no trampoline for me), when reading for more than fifteen minutes, when stooping, driving, doing the household, in short, in a lot of activities the complaints already take quickly. This of course has a great effect on the family. I sleep at noon, otherwise the enthusiastic stories from the boys' school will become too much for me during a cup of tea.My vision is not optimal, focusing is difficult, and I always see dots in my image (such as the snow image on the television of the past).HopeWhen I was at the UWV insurance doctor, he drew my attention to the doctors of tomorrow program. He said: ""Stephanie, you should go to America. They can help you. ""That naturally aroused our interest and we went to look at the program and on the website of Cognitive FX in Utah.They have developed a treatment in which the brain is trained in a better way of working, so that the brain starts working in a way that gives me few complaints. The results are so positive that I dare to hope that I don't have to sit at home all my life and weigh up all activities so as not to get overwhelmed.Because I am in contact with a number of people who have preceded me, and have already returned from Utah with very positive results, I am much more hopeful that this treatment will also do me a lot of good. How many people from the Netherlands have preceded me! It's really unbelievable how many people have to move to America to recover from brain damage.Thursday, January 23 2020, I had an intake interview, after we had completed a whole questionnaire, with the practitioners in Utah. They find me a very suitable candidate for their program and expect that I will definitely fall into the 70% improvement category.WishI would love to go to a party again, go to a concert or amusement park with our children, make nice extended music or just enjoy a whole day, or read a book without having a long time of having many more complaints about it and sleep for a long time.I would also love to be able to work again, to make it a lot easier financially for our home. Who knows, we might even start saving for a beautiful bus camper!I would even like to be able to clean the entire house again myself. It is so annoying and frustating that, in addition to his work, Martijn also has to do the household. He vacuums, mops, does the shopping, washes the windows, all the heavier jobs come on his shoulders. I keep track of the dusting (mostly) and do the laundry and the toilets, but that is a weekly task for me and is another reason to have to rest. Cooking is also not always successful, although the children do not complain, luckily fries in the actifry are quickly made. This is of course not too often, because the health of everyone in the family is essential. The kidsWhat I find very hard is, that the children always try to take me into account. They don't try to make too much noise, but try it during a nerve battle where the arrows are flying around the ears. They are really bothered by the fact that I can't have much. They are therefore worried about mommy. The children do not know me as the cheerful energetic Stephanie of the past.A few classmates from Nils and the Religion teacher said that for at least a year, Nils would light a candle for me in the class every Wednesday, because he so badly wanted Mama to get well again.As an extra positive point, he argues that when I am better, I can go back to work, so that he and his brother can then buy a nice mountain bike.Sven especially likes that I would get better and then go to a concert, for example, although I suspect that my head will never be able to withstand his heavy metal music.Final conclusionThe conclusion of my story is that I so badly want to return to my life, and that we think and believe that this is possible through the therapy offered in Utah.What will improve the quality of life of the entire family if no one has to take into account the complaints that arise with every sound and all, apparently normal, activities. How nice it would be to be able to have a social life again and just go to that busy birthday, be able to make nice music again and be able to make it very late in the evening without having another few very bad days or even weeks.How wonderful it is to wake up in the morning rested and to be able to think energetically about what I am going to do today, instead of dragging myself out of bed and at least trying to get as many things home as possible and in addition to crawl back into my bed to rest from it.How nice it would be if you would support me by donating money to make this possible.I want to thank everyone enormously for reading my story, for the compassion and hopefully also for the donations!Read more"

Dad was pushed into early retirement due to COVID and, since then has been helping mom around the house with chores, cooking and , finishing up a house repair project that needed to be done for years, but due to time and money was at the bottom of their priority list. Dad has always been one that is willing to help whenever needed, but never one to ask for help.Dad wasn’t far into his retirement when the most heart wrenching incident happened. Wednesday morning, mom headed to work for the day and returned late in the evening to find Dad on the floor, still in his pajamas. He had suffered a severe hemorrhagic stroke that left him unable to see or move. No one was around all day, until mom came home. The ambulance rushed him to the hospital and we were told that Dad would likely not make it due to the severity of the stroke. dad made it through the night, but had suffered a very bad head bleed to the point the doctors were giving their condolences during rounds the next day.Dad continues to remain in the ICU and every day we see Dad fighting for his life. We are hopeful that we may be able to bring home someday, but if he continues to progress, Dad will need many months to years of rehabilitation as he tries to heal his brain and relearn to do simple daily functions. The road ahead looks long and hard, but we are thankful and treat each day as a blessing that Dad is still with us and is still fighting.Dad was never one to ask for help, but we are asking for help on his behalf. If and when Dad is able to be transferred out of the ICU, he will still be required to have long term help and rehabilitation. Even with health insurance this has left mom with a heavy emotional and financial burden. We ask for help for him and our mom as she is struggling with Dad’s current circumstance and trying to figure out how to pay for the bills and where the money will come from. Any support will help to relieve this burden for mom, help with hospital bills and hopefully rehabilitation, as well as help to make Dad’s home suitable for any needs Dad may have if and when he is able to come home. We understand that the road is long, but hope that we will be fortunate enough to bring home home someday to a house that is prepared to meet Dad’s needs. We appreciate any support that is given.

You see, several years earlier, his wife, Natalia, had given birth to a precious little girl, Emma, and the arrival of this magical childopened Jacek’s eyes to some of the ways in which he had unwittingly taken to living—working long hours, eating for convenience over health, and not getting regular exercise save running up and down subway stairs. It was shortly thereafter that Jacek took uprunningas part of a new commitment to get and stay healthy, as he’d declared to me proudly one day at work, “I know I’m only 37, but Iwant to be there when Emma graduates. I want to walk her down the aisle someday.""And with that declaration, Jacek's priorities shifted seemingly overnight. His daughter and wife (and now his small son, Oliver), became his priorities and the very reasonsfor which he would begin taking better care of himself. Little did he know that his comment—made half in jest—would hold the significance that it did.Jacek and his little angel, EmmaSo, onthat particular Saturday back in May, as Jacek headed for a run, he had no idea that he was about to go into cardiac arrest before making it to the park and that no one would perform resuscitative measures on him for at least 10 minutes (possibly more). He had no idea that his brain would be deprived of oxygen (anoxia) for at least 10 minutes (possibly more) and that he would be literallydropping open the jaw of every EMTon the scene who’d presumed that the tragedy unfolding before them—just like every other one with the same circumstances—would likely end tragically as well.The EMTs were wrong.Even though doctors initially had told Jacek's family that he would never talk or move again, a month-long medically induced coma helped stablize his body and commence brain healing, and he became ""healthy"" enough to be moved to a brain injury rehabilitation facility in early June. Not surprisingly to any of us who know him (though very surprisingly to most of the rehab staff), Jacek surpassed all expectations in the rehab. He can read headlines and kiss his family and talk in a whisper. And this from someone they'd said would never move again!He is not walking yet, but he moves his arms and legs and has finally (thankfully) had the eating tube removed from his stomach, letting him ingest soft foods and liquids orally.Jacek with his wife, Natalia, by his sideJacek with Natalia and his children Oliver and EmmaLast month, Jacek was moved from Helen Hayes Hospital in W. Haverford, NY, to a rehab facility closer to home. This was done because Helen Hayes is an acute facility, which permits only short-term stays. The new rehab facility was not the family’s first choice but was the only one that had open beds while satisfying insurance as well as facility restrictions (e.g., no tracheotomies allowed, etc.). Unfortunately, the actual transport traumatized Jacek (common among brain injury victims) and set him back a bit. He suffered seizures (which were misdiagnosed); however, there was also a benefit—Jacek was closer to friends and family. He responds very positively to visitors, such as his co-workers, whom he recognized and was thrilled to see (during the times he was “present”) while at Helen Hayes.Jacek surrounded by his family of co-workers—I'm loving that smile!The goal has been to get Jacek into the New York State Certified Traumatic Brain Injury Rehabilitation Program at the Park Terrace Care Center in Rego Park, the best facility for his particular brain injury. That prayer was answered last week! The downside is that Park Terrace is out of Jacek’s insurance network, and the cost of a single night is $700—just for the bed. His family has had to pay an entire month’s expenses out of pocket just to secure the “last bed,” which wasn't available until that gesture.That makes my blood boil, but that’s okay; we’re where we want to be. Everyoneis grateful and will take it from there.And that is what I’m doing here, now—trying to “take it from there.” I know that this is only the tip of the “financial burden”iceberg for Jacek and his family. The long and short of it is that medical funds are dwindling quickly. Personal savings are being tapped into regularly as out-of-pocket expenses are increasing, while delays in insurance claims prevent expenses from being reimbursed in a timely fashion. Then thereare construction costs for making his home handicapped accessible in anticipation of his return, however long it may take. I know I’ve likely overlooked some important information to help justify this request in many of your minds, but please don’t let that stop you from helping Jacek fully recover, which we know he will do if he receives the proper care, which we can make happen right here and now. “I know I’m only 37, but I want to be there when Emma graduates. I want to walk her down the aisle someday.” That sentiment from several years back is the driving force behind my intention here. I am determined to see Jacek walk his daughterdown the aisle.He is already beating the odds like nobody’s business, and I know he can do it! Thank you for your selfless love and support, and God bless you regardless of your decision.HOW YOU CAN HELP TODAY1.Please GIVEwhat you can. No donation is too small.

He was put into an induced coma in the ICU. After lots of test, doctors were still unsure what had caused the ‘seizure’ or what was wrong with him, a stroke and brain haemorrhage were both ruled out as nothing was showing on scans. Upon coming out of the coma, it was becoming more prominent that Daz was not responding as a normal patient should when waking up. He was awake but was only able to move his eyes up and down and was responding via eye movement when asked. A specialist was called in to have a look at him.After speaking to doctors and looking at his notes and scans, the specialist seemed to know what was wrong. Daz had suffered a huge and rare brainstem stroke, which was not clearly noticeable on the scans as it’s at the very base of the brain. The brainstem sits just above the spinal cord and controls speech, breathing, body temperature and impulses sent from the brain to various body parts. We all need the brainstem to function for survival, making a brainstem stroke life threatening.The specialist diagnosed Daz with Locked-in Syndrome as a result of the stroke. Only 1% of stroke victims are left with this condition. This neuro specialist had only ever seen the condition once before, and it wasn’t in Barrow.It meant the way we saw him after coming out of the coma would be how he would be for the foreseeable. This is complete paralysis of all voluntary movements of the body except vertical eye movement which would be his only way of communicating (look up for ‘yes’ and down for ‘no’). There is no treatment or cure for the condition, we can only hope Daz can make some kind of recovery. Daz’s cognitive part of his brain is unaffected, meaning he is still himself, he knows what’s going on around him, he can still think and reason. He still feels touch, pain, itches etc. He is as the name states, ‘locked’ inside his body. Due to the extent of the condition, Daz was offered a DNR after the diagnosis. He looked down, he wanted to fight it, so we’re fighting it with him. To read about brainstem strokes;https://www.strokeassociation.org/en/about-stroke/types-of-stroke/brain-stem-strokeTo read about Locked-in Syndrome;https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/locked-in-syndrome/Since the diagnosis, Daz has spent the last 2 years in hospitals or rehabilitation centres. He is currently in Southport, 100 miles away from home at a Neuro-rehabilitation centre receiving care and therapy in hope he can regain any sort of movement and/or better communication. Partner Kelly and daughters Kirsten and Shannon visit every week but we cannot see him as often as we would like. Kelly and Daz have an 11 year old son, Connor, she has to take care of with the help of Daz’s step children, Mark and Jamie. And Kirsten and Shannon both work full time. Although he clearly appreciates the visits, 2 years away from home and his family is a very very long time, it has taken its toll and he wants to come home!! He is missing out on Connor growing up, he misses his family and friends and he needs the best quality of life we can give him.Daz has gained some minor movement in his fingers and wrists and his head has become stronger. He is now able to shake his head for ‘no’ but continues to look up for ‘yes’. This has allowed us to use his spell board a lot better. Recently he is spelling out sentences more clear and he has used the spell board to ask to come home frequently, along with the occasional insult! As you can see he hasn’t lost his sense of humour!We started the the process of trying to get him home a while ago but have hit some obstacles along the way. As his condition requires a mass amount of personal care it’s quite hard. The council won’t provide accommodation yet as there is a waiting list and there is nothing suitable for Daz’s complex needs. The council have said that we would be best off finding our own accommodation for him. This is for obvious reasons very difficult. We cannot privately rent a property as no landlord would allow us to make the adaptations Daz needs so our only other option is to buy a suitable and adaptable properly for Daz, Kelly and Connor to live in.We are currently in the process of selling Daz’s own house, the money from this will be going towards a new home for him. We have already viewed a suitable properly within our price range but we will still need funds for adaptations, renovations and equipment for him to use. Some of what we need will be funded by social services but not everything therefore all funds from this page will go towards the rest.We hope this page will help us achieve this and help us bring him home where he belongs!!!Any donations are more than appreciated and we would like to thank everyone in advance for their support!Read more"

Just over 2 weeks from racing Ironman Australia in Port Macquarie, on 18 April 2017, Lauren had a catastrophic bike accident in training that resulted in serious injuries to Lauren. Lauren’s injuries include a punctured lung, a broken scapula, broken ribs, a shattered pelvis, a broken T12 vertebrae and spinal cord damage. Lauren was admitted to the ICU at The John Hunter Hospital and underwent spinal surgery within hours of the accident, however Lauren remains paralysed from the belly button down and Doctors have given Lauren a very small chance of ever walking again.  On 20 April 2017 Lauren was flown to the Royal North Shore Spinal Cord Injury Unit in Sydney for further treatment and ongoing rehabilitation. Lauren’s treatment could take up to 12 months and Lauren’s beautiful Mum, Anne (Loz’s best friend and biggest supporter) will be by her side. Lauren and her family will face significant expenses over the next 12 months and beyond. From the outset, Lauren’s Mum has taken time away from work and will incur expenses associated with accommodation so that she can be with Lauren during her rehabilitation in Sydney. For anyone that has ever had anything to do with Lauren, you will know that she is incredibly humble and kind, has a smile that just warms your soul and is one of the most consistent and committed athletes there is. Although Loz has faced setbacks in her life and as an athlete, through patience and sheer determination, Loz has always conquered any obstacles in her path. Lauren comes from an elite swimming background, having competed at State and National levels and training with various Newcastle clubs. Loz was also a well regarded member of the Caves Beach Surf Life Saving Club before beginning triathlon in 2008. Lauren initially began racing Sprint and Olympic distance events before setting her sights on the Ironman distance in 2014. Just 12 months later, Loz’s hard work and perseverance were rewarded when she qualified for and raced the Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii in 2015. The many communities that Lauren is a part of are in absolute shock at the news of Lauren’s accident. At a time when the pain of looking forward probably seems too great for Lauren, we ask Loz to look beside her because we are here. We are here in the hundreds and thousands, we are here from all over the world from all different walks of life and we are all rallying for such an incredible [Iron]woman. We know that whatever the future holds for Lauren, she will be brilliant and we would like to play a small part in Loz's journey to recovery by donating whatever we can to help her cause. Even the smallest amount will help. I have been asked to provide some additional details by Go Fund Me in the interests of transparency. My name is Rebecca Smaus, I am a friend of Lauren's having met her in about 2011 through Trinova, a triathlon training group in Newcastle, NSW where we both reside. A number of Lauren's close friends, training partners and her current Coach, John Hill, decided that we would create this page to assist Lauren and her family raise funds so that Lauren's mother could be by her side whilst she is in hospital undergoing further treatment and rehabilitation. Lauren's mother, Anne, has had to take time away from her two jobs and essentially relocate to Sydney during this time of significant stress for Lauren, these funds will go towards the costs Anne will incur in travel and accommodation and will help to cover other expeses given that Anne and Lauren will not be working.  The funds will also be used to cover medical costs that are not covered by Medicare.  Given the injuries sustained by Lauren and her prognosis, no doubt Lauren will require extensive treatment, ongoing rehabilitation and potentially modifications to her home in the future.  Lauren also intends to explore treatment options overseas including clinical trials utilising stem cell research. Further details in relation to expenses will be provided as they become available.  The funds will be paid directly from Go Fund Me to Lauren's mother for her to manage on Lauren's behalf.Thank you so much for your assistance and for helping to ease the burden on Lauren and her family.Read more"

Fifteen months ago we lost his daddy, Ric, to pulmonary fibrosis. Kylis and I have been grieving and missing him terribly. In May of 2011, a friend a friend saw a box ready to be swept away in the flooding waters and decided to check it out. Inside, she found a tiny puppy, just 6 weeks old, wet, and scared. Our sweet sister brought him to us, and we instantly fell in love with him.Unable to have children of our own, Kylis (pronounced K-less because of how Ric spells his name without a ""k"") became our son. He instantly created a special bond with each of us. I am KK's momma and the one he cuddles at night, but daddy? Daddy was his buddy.In 2015, Ric became seriously ill. Throughout his illness, Kylis never left his side and supported him as only a dog can, with lots of snuggles and wet kisses. One day in 2017, however, Ric left the house without Kylis and never returned.Struck with grief and having lost our home and income along with my husband, I moved in with my parents. Kylis came with me, and the two of us are going through the grieving process together, leaning on each other for support. It is amazing how he knows just when to curl up with me, and nuzzle my face to wipe the tears away, or to jump on me to make me laugh. We both look forward to the walks we take everyday. Somedays its the only time I leave the house. I don't know how I would have survived losing Ric if I wouldn't have had Kylis to love and to need me.Kylis has completely torn his CCL (ACL) in his right rear leg. Without surgery Kylis can only gain back 50% of his mobility.I don't want that life for him. I want my happy, playful, carefree baby back, I want to take him to the lake where we had planned to go as a family, and let him run in Lake Erie for the first time. He's a big part of what I have left of my life with my husband. He's our baby.With this procedure and a rehabilitation period, Kylis will be able to get back 95% of his mobility. And because this surgery completely changes the structure of the knee, there's no risk of this happening again. Kylis will be able to live out the rest of his life pain-free.Since losing Ric, I have become the caretaker for my elderly parents and pick up small jobs outside the home as I can. I do not have the ability to afford this procedure without the generosity of others. 100% of all funds would be used to pay for his surgery. If you feel like you can help me afford this surgery for my baby, it would be tremendously appreciated.To be able to restore his ability to walk and jump and play, would mean to world to both of us. We long to make the trip Ric looked forward to; taking Kylis to swim in the waves of Lake Erie. Without the surgery, fulfilling that dream of Rics will never be possible.

By the end of the day Tyler, their oldest son (13), was diagnosed with a brain tumour. A mass the size of an orange is pushing on part of his brain, taking up 'luxury real estate', causing him sharp pain from movement, nausea, dizziness, and vomiting. Brain surgery was scheduled for Friday, December 11. Until the tumour is removed and sent for testing, they do not know what type it is. The head of neurology in Canada will be performing the surgery and they are being well-taken care of at the Stollery in Edmonton. They have also secured a room at the Ronald McDonald House, which is already an answer to prayer. Tyler's surgery will begin at 7am and will go until 5pm. Mike & Deb Hultink (Tyler's mom & dad) have been told that he will not be able to speak, walk, or drink when he awakes. The hope is that these things will return in time. Tyler will spend a minimum of 4-6 weeks at the Stollery and then will be in rehabilitation at the Glenrose in Edmonton for 3-12 months.They were told the surgery is their ""mountain"" and there will be many ""hills"" after that. This has been a shock and a lot to process in only a few days. They covet your prayers for the surgery, and beyond. Prayers for Tyler's younger siblings, Gabe, Mason, and Molly who remain at home with caregivers.As you can imagine, the costs will add up quickly: time off work, staying in Edmonton for an extended time, many hours on the road in 2021.

Glenn is married and has three beautiful children. They reside in Ladera Ranch, California. Glenn is a gentle, loving, and compassionate man and has spent his entire life taking care of others. Now it is time for us to take care of him. On February 25, 2020, Glenn received a small cut on his finger. He cleaned it and resumed life as normal. The next day, Glenn complained of not feeling well, so he visited an Online Physician who diagnosed him as having the flu. This diagnosis was not surprising because his family had the flu the week before. Two days later, Glenn felt that he was getting worse, so he went to an Urgent Care Facility. They diagnosed him with Bronchitis and a severe case of the flu and sent him home. That same night he began to experience numbness in his feet, so he decided to go the Emergency Room at Mission Hospital. There Glenn was diagnosed with a serious infection from an unknown source and admitted to the ICU with total renal failure. Glenn was talking that afternoon but by that evening he was on life support. He remained on life support for days and was not expected to live. However, our prayers were answered, and he survived. He is still in the ICU and on dialysis. There was some heart damage but we are praying that it will naturally repair itself. It is also possible that there may be residual effects that will include some amputation. Unfortunately, the medications administered to save his life caused damage to his extremities. We are still praying about this because we know that God is the ultimate doctor and healer.Glenn and his family will incur exorbitant medical costs and will still be faced with the responsibilities of paying for everyday living expenses, such as care for Glenn, rent, bills, food, etc. There will be many months, if not years of rehabilitation for Glenn. Therefore, he will need help. ALL FUNDS COLLECTED WILL GO DIRECTLY TO GLENN AND HIS FAMILY TO PAY FOR OUT OF POCKET MEDICAL EXPENSES, REHABILITATION AND NECESSARY LIVING EXPENSES. CONTRIBUTIONS CAN ALSO BE SENT VIA VENMO TO SHERIDAN@SHERIDAN-EADDY.Glenn and his family need assistance, so we are asking everyone who is able and wants to be part of his recovery to give whatever you can. No amount is too small and will certainly be appreciated. Even if you are unable to give, please pray for Glenn and his family.Thank YouRead more"

I know we are all struggling in one way or another due to Covid, but on top of this, my small family is once again fighting cancer - together.6 years ago, my dad was diagnosed with, and beat, tonsil cancer. Now my mom, Miriam, only 58 years old, is battling Stage 4 gallbladder cancer.In mid-August, my mom started experiencing severe symptoms associated with gallstones. She had been seeing her primary care physician for almost one whole year prior, voicing her concerns over these same symptoms. No tests were ever performed. After rushing her to the ER for excruciating pain, her doctors explained to her that several masses were found in her gallbladder, liver, and abdominal area. She was soon diagnosed with stage 4 cancer.Since August, we have been in and out of the ER and ICU. Our doctors estimated at that point that she had weeks-months to live. Her symptoms ranged from all over body swelling from the cancerous fluid to crippling abdominal pain likely from the tumors. Paracenteses were performed every week to remove the fluids from her abdomen. She looked as if she were 9 months pregnant and her legs swelled to 3x their natural size. She could not walk, move, or sit up-right. Complications from cancer has made an already unbearable situation worse. The fluid pressed against her lungs, making it difficult to breathe, and blood clots formed in her legs and lungs. Through August and September, her doctors concluded that she was not strong enough to begin chemotherapy.We sought out a second opinion at City of Hope, not covered by insurance, and there, they agreed with our doctor's initial diagnosis and prognosis.Fortunately, in October, my mom was finally stable enough to begin chemotherapy. Treatments seem to be working in our favor, but we still have a long and tough road ahead of us. Stage 4 is more often than not terminal, and although no one is ever prepared to lose a loved one, we sure as hell are going to fight like hell, because at 23 years old, I'm simply not ready to lose her.Since her diagnosis, I have been her primary caregiver. I dropped out of school, was granted a temporary leave of absence from my employer, and have dedicated all my time and love to care for my mom. My dad, unfortunately, has not been here through these testing times.We are lucky enough to have insurance, but even insurance doesn't cover all the costs. Not working these past few months and my mom having to close her business down permanently has taken a HUGE financial toll. From co-pays, ER/ICU bills, groceries, rehabilitation, home expenses, and caregivers (when I return to work), it has been overwhelming at the very least.

On April 19, I had a massive accident, which left me with a cracked skull & a cracked neck and a crushed left leg. I was in the hospital for 2 weeks and then transferred to a rehabilitation facility for a while. Until this day I am very weak, I have no body balance, I have nerve damage to my left leg, I suffer from massive headaches & the list goes on & on.....

The last thing any of us want is his children to worry about how the bills are going to get paid or if he is going to lose their family home because he will be out of work for the foreseeable future.Dennis is a loving father to two amazing children Dj and Addy, an incredible son, brother, uncle & friend. He is hardworking and loving, funny and courageous. He is a fighter and we are hoping for more miracles to come his way.Anyone who knows this man, knows hes one of the Kindest, most generous people. Over the past several years, he has donated and volunteered in his community making sure to take care of the veterans, children and homeless. If we can show him how much we need and appreciate people like him in our community, his family will be most appreciative. We are so grateful for your donation.With Positive Vibes and Prayers, Sincerely,Heather Miller and the Casto FamilyRead more"

Shortly about Saha:

It is with a heavy heart that we are writing this, but unfortunately it is necessary as our family is in need of help now more than ever.

Our son/ little brother/cousin Saha was and still is a joyfull, spirited and caring 16 year old boy.He attends his first year at high school, has a big circle of friends and family around him and played professional football for Raufoss Footbal club. By age 16, in 2019:-Raufoss 2 (3.division) with 15 matches and 2 goals-Raufoss G19 with 14 matches and 4 goalsBy age 14, in 2017 og 2018:-Raufoss G16 with 17 matches and 21 goals-Played for the Regional team and Norwegian Football federation with7 matches-Played for U14 nation tournament in NorwayThis all was turned upside down on 30.November 2019.The accident:  

On a night that was meant to celebrate the ending of the football season, ended disastrously for Saha when he and his friend decided to do a flip together and collided mid-air. Seconds later Saha lied on the ground and was unable to move.His big brother (1 year older) and his friends managed to stabilize him and call the ambulance. When the ambulance came, they did not get any response from his torso and legs, they called an ambulance helicopter wich took him to Oslo hospital.Here, they confirmed that he had broken his neck and disc C4-C5 wich is located at the top of the neck. He then underwent an 8 hour long surgery where they put the discs back into place, but the damage to the spinal cord had already been done.We were all sitting in the waiting room at the hospital when the surgeons came out and informed us that he had 1% chance of ever moving his legs again.Our world was turned upside down.At the hospital, Saha was 2 days in induced coma. He was fed with painkillers and they tried to stabilize his blood pressure as much as possible.Finally when his blood pressure was stabilize enough, he then was transferred to Sunnaas rehabilitation center.It was here his biggest and toughest battle began.Our hopes and his mentality:Saha has always been a fighter. He never gives up, and has always worked hard. He is absolutely a beautiful human beeing that we love so much and we are so proud of. Because of his fighting mentality we are convinced that he will be able to walk again and both we and Saha are doing anything in  our power to help him achieve this goal.When Saha first arrived at Sunnaas, he was only able to move his left shoulder one cm up and down. Nothing else. Now after 6 months we have seen his progress exceed beyond the expectations of the surgeons and doctors regarding patients with this type of spinal cord injury. This summer he will be discharged from Sunnaas after 6 months of intense rehabilitation.Our dream and his way forward:Due to limited treatments available in Norway, we have been searching international and found several facilities in countries such as Canada, USA, Thailand, Panama etc. These facilities provide all different ways of treatments such as epidural stimulation, stem cells therapy and intensive/high tech training with great success rate among patiens with Spinal cord injury. This have given them control and feeling back over muscles they previously did not have any control over. Treatment decisions:Based on information gathered and several consultations with doctors and specialist have we decided to  do the Epidural stimulation operation and stem cell treatment in Bangkok, thailand.This may give him the chance to stand and even perhaps take his first steps.The hospital/rehabilitation clinic is known worldwide and this treatments is the newest within spinal cord injuries and giving hope to the patients.The hospital is owned by Verita Neuro Pte. Ltd. and is powered by Verita Health care group.( https://epiduralstimulationnow.com/)Donations:The whole family are behind Saha and we are doing everything in our power to help him achieve his goal. We are also aware that this treatment is not the final treatment for him and that he will be needing more in order to ever walk again.The treatment, surgery and facilitated training at the clinic in Bangkok are scoped out for Saha to cost a total of 4.2million NOK ($ 420 000). We as a family have already been able to afford around 2,2 million NOK ($220 000), for this purpose.Therefore, we would like to take this opportunity to thank any of our friends who are willing to help us. Every little thing matters. All of the amount assembled will be put in a fund and will only be used to pay for and provide Saha with treatments that can help him take his first steps again and hopefully be able to one day walk again. Our sincere gratitude to everyone who will and could help us achieve this.We would also like to point out the importance of shared this between your friends and teammates as well. It is important that we reach out to as many as possible. Together we can make a difference.If you have any questions or need any further information, please feel free to contact us at any given time.'

He was rushed to a local hospital where he underwent an emergency cardiac surgery and is currently in intensive care.

Since we cannot physically be there for him, we thought the best way to show our support is to collect funds and provide him and his family with financial support. The funds collected will be used to alleviate medical expenses (surgery, hospital stay, medications, rehabilitation, etc.), travel related costs, and Hong Kong living expenses. We can only imagine what the cost of medical expenses in Hong Kong will be, as well as the costs to live in Hong Kong during his recovery.We appreciate any help that you can provide.

Dave, known as ""Big Dave"" and ""Old Man"" left behind three children and seven grandchildren.  Before his medical issues, Dave lived in various states across the Midwest overseeing commercial construction of large scale commercial skyscrapers in Chicago, to multiple restaurants including McDonalds, Burger King, and Chuckie Cheese. It was his profession that unfortunately debilitated him when he was injured on the job and later diagnosed with reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) which caused physical atrophy, limited mobility, and constant pain. Unfortunately, as Dave battled with RSD, he began having other setbacks to include complete rehabilitation following an extended coma, MRSA infection in his spine, and various injuries to include a hip reconstruction, multiple leg surgeries, and constant battles with other problems associated with all his setbacks.Due to COVID and Dave's children being scattered across (Germany, Illinois, Kansas) not all his children were able to be with him at his time of death. With the ongoing pandemic and economic challenges, his family requests any help with ensuring Dave is given proper rites and put to rest. Support would help with public honors via an obituary, death certificate, cremation, and proper storage within urns.  Please see below for announcements from his friends and family upon news of his death:""It is with a heavy heart that I must relay that my dad, David Obrosky has passed away. Despite the pandemic, some family members were able to be around him in his last moments.Whether you knew Dave for 40 years or 40 minutes, you would be subject to a joke or light-hearted verbal jab. He let you know where you stood, based on your actual stature. He was a height elitist.As most people are, my father was a complicated person. Complicated people make for complicated lives but one simple and obvious thing about him was that he loved making people laugh. He also loved to tell grandiose stories, some true, others had a little Dave ""imagination"" sprinkled in here and there.Later in life, my father began investing more time in getting to know his grandchildren. Seeing and being around his grandchildren would turn this Harley-riding, pony-tail wearing, leather-jacketed extrovert into a prototypical grandpa.As we go through the grieving process, I ask that you remember him and those who cared about and for him. If you wish to honor him, please simply put him in your prayers and/or thoughts.Rest in Peace Dad. I hope you find the softtail Harley of your dreams up there. See you again one day."" - Kyle Obrosky (Son)""My daddy has been my hero and strength my whole life.No matter the lifestyle he choose to live I accepted him for who he was and loved him unconditionally.I will always remember his strength his loving heart and most of all the way he could make me laugh.No matter the distance through out my life I knew no matter what I always had my daddy, I feel lost broken and like my heart is gone. My mother is my back bone but my daddy had my heart since the day I was born.I am going to miss you daddy but I know you are no longer suffering or in pain watching you leave this earth completely broke me and shattered my heart and world.

So This is Our Story: A story of a Dad and a stroke. The above photo epitomises our father, his sparkling blue eyes and a smile that lights up a room that is infectious to all. He is a very much beloved husband, grandfather, friend and most of all our cherished father. 

On 29 September 2016, in a blink of an eye our close knit family was ripped to shreds by a stroke, a stroke that took down our 59 year old father that blindsided us all, which has now changed everything for our parents. 

For weeks our father was in the Intensive Care Unit ventilated with leads coming out of him and we all waited with anticipation and praying he would wake up the same old father, but that never happened. 


Dad woke but without movement to his right arm and leg, unable to sit up, unable to walk, not able to talk or eat, our once strong father who looked after everyone in our family was now weak and needed us to help him. We placed photos around his room to remind him how much he was loved, we asked him repetitive questions, who am I, where do you live, do you know where you are. Some days he mumbled them correctly other days he got them confused or wrong. However, we persevered waiting for our Dad to come through and bit-by-bit we would see glimmers of our old Dad. 

In just 3 months, since Dad had his stroke, he has had pneumonia, a mild heart attack and is now requiring surgery to fix his broken hip after falling from his wheelchair, however our Dad is a fighter and we know he will try again to move forward, he may not be the same old Dad that we are use too, but he is our Dad and we love him to bits and he will be the same old new dad. 

Our Dad was the most hardworking tradie we knew, and he would go out of his way for so many, he is a very loving and thoughtful husband to our beautiful mother, whom he absolutely loves; they are true soul mates, which is evident when you are in their presence. 


Our family is never one to ask for help, my parents are way too proud for that but there comes a time when help is exactly what you need. The main reason we are asking our community for their assistance to support our parents in this extremely trying time is because my parents need it more than ever, as they have a long road ahead of them with so many expenses and modifications to be undertaken. 

Our father operated his own Floor Sanding business 'Whats Woody Floor Sanding', however like many others he thought he had many years to prepare for retirement, however this isn’t to be and now my parents need assistance. My mother will be giving up full time work (Retail Assistant) to care for my father and unfortunately there is limited finances to assist my parents. My sister and I are giving and doing all that we can but it won’t be nearly enough for the years ahead of them. 


We are hoping that any support that the community can provide to my parents to assist them to install a ramp, home modifications for a wheelchair, car modification (new used car), equipment requirements, physiotherapy, speech therapy and more additional rehabilitation services would be sincerely appreciated. Every dollar helps and is greatly appreciated. 

If you are unable to donate, could you kindly share this GoFundMe with your community and send a bit of sunshine our way. Thank you from two daughters that love their parents.

Shirley Ray is my wonderful mother-in-law, and an amazing grandma (""Yaya"") to my children. I've known her for 18 years now, and she's always the one taking care of others. She's always been there for her 5 children, 6 grandchildren, her own siblings, neighbors, and friends.

Well now it's time for others to take care of her.

February 11th, she was at my house taking care of my daughters while I was at work. My husband was working upstairs when he heard his mom call for him. When he came down, she was in paralyzing pain and losing consciousness. He called for an ambulance, and they rushed her to the ER.Shirley had had an aneurysm and hemorrhage stroke on the left bottom of her brain. She'd never had any health issues before, and is only 63. It all happened so suddenly, and we've never been more scared.For over two weeks she was comatose in the hospital. She was on a ventilator battling infections, but still clinging to life. We didn't know if she would even wake up, but we continued to pray. The doctors and nurses provided incredible care for her.On March 1st, she woke up! Her infections are getting better but not gone, her aneurysm is healing, and she's off the ventilator, breathing on her own! She can swallow OK, but she still has a feeding peg because she can't eat and drink as much as she needs. Cognitively, she's in great condition. She understands everything and can whisper and mouth words in response.

We couldn't be happier, and we know God has been with us through all of this. But it's not over yet. First, Shirley will have a long road to recovery. She needs physical therapy and lots of support. She's still in a fragile state. Second, she has no health insurance. She doesn't qualify for Medicaid, and the medical bills are shocking.

She will owe the hospital close to 1 million dollars. The hospital will be discharging her soon, and we are trying to figure out how to afford rehabilitation for her. In addition, my faither-in-law has had to miss some work during these difficult weeks.

Any money received would go to 1) her current hospital bills, 2) to pay for some form of rehabilitation, either in home or in a facility, and 3) to help pay their regular bills while my father-in-law takes care of her.

Thank you to everyone who has supported us during this time, and thank you for any donations!

Please pray for Shirley during this difficult time, and please share this post.Thank you!

He was traveling east on a little 2 lane hwy and as he approached a convenience store on his right he saw 2 vehicles traveling westbound, the second vehicle was tailgating the first and edging over the line. My son adjusted his lane position to the outside of the lane to give the car on the line more room but the driver of the orange Dodge Caliper didn't want more room, he wanted to get into the convenience store parking lot. Unfortunately, he ""didn't see"" the motorcycle, he ""didn't see"" the young man traveling home to his family, he ""didn't see"" my son. The driver of the car, I assume, was going the posted speed limit of 55 and my son was doing about 60 when the 2 vehicles met at the edge of the parking lot entrance. In what I can only imagine was an explosion of violence and pain for my son as the car smashed into him, driving his left leg into the engine and shattering the bones within; the ribs of the engine and fender of the car tearing away flesh and leaving the leg ""shredded"" as the doctors would later describe the results of the impact. Unfortunately, although that is the worst damage, it is not the only damage. In what probably took a total of 5 seconds Vinny went from riding home to literally flying through the air landing some 30-40 feet from his now destroyed motorcycle. The impact also broke Vinny's right foot which means he will not be able to walk for at least 6 weeks. His left hip: broken, now repaired with a rod and a guarantee of a future hip replacement. He cracked some ribs and he tore some stuff inside which caused internal bleeding so he has a nice set of staples from just below his sternum to a little below his navel. He was airlifted (life flight) from the scene to the nearest trauma center where he spent a week in ICU and is currently residing in the TICU unit. He has been hospitalized since 8 December , has endured multiple surgeries and will remain this way for the foreseeable future. The Drs are trying to save his leg; 5 surgeries later it is still a 50/50 chance but after a brief talk we have learned that Vinny can make the decision of losing his leg or continue to endure the pain that will be associated with the reconstruction and long rehabilitation of his leg if it actually gets to a salvageable point. One moment he is riding his motorcycle and now, through no fault of his own, he gets to choose whether or not to lose his leg.     Due to the accident, Vinny will be out of work for quite some time, we are assuming about a year. I am starting this gofundme so he can continue to pay the bills of everyday life: rent is still due along with all of the other expenses of just living and the now additional expenses of getting to what will be his new ""normal"". The medical, legal, rehabilitation, and therapy bills will be dealt with as best we can but in the near term, your donations will help reduce the stress and financial burden that will consume him and his new family for years to come. I thank you for your kindness and gratitude. Please look for motorcycles when on the road and stay safe.Read more"

She always looks for new ways to help others and the community. For example, she donates blood platelets, goes to the food bank, helps rebuild homes, and donates to many shelters. Her happy energy constantly brightens people's day in an instant, whether it be by dancing or cracking jokes.On May 2, 2020, Cyndi went to donate blood platelets, which is something she loved to do every two weeks because she knows there is a high demand for it. After the three hour process of donating blood, she went grocery shopping in Japantown, San Francisco. While she was standing in line to enter the market, she began to feel dizzy so she got out of line to sit down. She decided she should go home instead and got up to start walking to her car. However, as she began walking she fainted and fell straight back, hitting her head on the concrete floor. We think her fainting was a result of donating blood platelets and difficulty breathing from wearing a mask, as required during the COVID-19 pandemic (we aren’t sure of the real cause). This fall fractured her skull, causing a severe amount of brain bleeding and swelling in her left temporal lobe, the area of the brain that controls speech, comprehension, and cognition.That night in the emergency room, as the bleeding and swelling in her brain worsened, Cyndi had to undergo a decompressive craniectomy, which is a surgery to remove a portion of her skull to allow room for the brain to swell. After the surgery, she was still in critical condition but stable and was hooked up to two blood drains, monitors in the brain to keep track of brain swelling, a breathing tube, and a feeding tube.She spent 5 days in the neuro-ICU in the hospital, and has shown miraculous progress in her recovery. On May 7, she was moved out of the ICU as she moved out of the critical period of her injuries and past the days of peak swelling. She has also started to breathe on her own, so her breathing tube has been removed.Given the COVID-19 pandemic, her family has not been able to visit, so if you have any pictures or memories you would like to share with her, we can send those over to the hospital as well. The doctors say that anything to remind her of family and friends could bring back memories.This fundraiser will help Cyndi and her family with the medical bills as well as the care she is expected to need once she is back home with her family. Because of the location of the trauma to her brain, the doctors expect there to be deficits in her speech and understanding, so therapy and rehabilitation will also play significant roles in her recovery.Cyndi is a single mom of two sons, Jason (20) and Dylan (18). She is the oldest of five daughters and caretaker of her mother. She was not expected to progress as well as she has, but we know she's a fighter and we call her our miracle. We kindly ask you to join us in supporting her and getting her through this journey.Read more"

Police were about to close the road because of the weather conditions when the accident happened. Due to the severity of the accident, emergency responders were not expecting to find Dave alive at the scene. Through some miracle, he was. However, he was badly injured and trapped in his car. Fire fighters worked for an hour to remove him from the vehicle. Once removed, a helicopter flew him directly to Sunnybrook Hospital where he was admitted and remains in critical care.Dave's left leg is badly damaged and will require several more surgeries to repair. He broke his femur (since repaired through surgery), and his tibia and fibia were broken in several spots (surgeries are ongoing). His knee was ""blown out"" and is now being held together with wire. His ankle is badly damaged as well. There is a serious and ongoing risk of infection in his leg which may to lead to amputation. He has two fractured discs in his neck which are being monitored and he is in a neck brace. Dave requires a vertical CT; however, this cannot be done right now because he cannot put weight on his leg to stand up. Doctors are working on a plan of action. He has a bruised spleen which is expected to heal. He had glass removed from his eyes; and his eyesight is intact. There has, thankfully, not been any indication of damage to his head/brain. As things are, we know that he will need more surgeries this week, next week, and 3 months from now. It will be at least 3 months before he can put weight on his leg. It will be 3-6 months of rehabilitation, part of which we understand will be in-patient rehab, and 9-12 months before returning to modified duties at work. This is a major trauma not only for Dave, but also his family: Katie (wife), Ronan (son, age 12), Angus (son, age 4), and Eloise (daughter, age 1). We know that there will be physical and emotional strain on Dave and his family for the foreseeable future. Katie is already trying to manage being with Dave at the hospital in Toronto, but also ensuring normalcy for their younger children, Angus and Eloise, who are in London, ON. Ronan, Dave’s eldest child, is back and forth to the hospital while continuing with school. Katie will have to take time off work to help care for Dave, which means that their income will be reduced. Insurance and benefits will cover a certain percentage of Dave’s needs, but it is not 100% and it is not immediate. Right now, extra costs are for travel, parking, and food. Other foreseeable costs include accommodations and child care. Long term, the family will need to supplement lost and reduced income, medical equipment, medicine and pain management, ongoing doctor and specialist appointments, and rehabilitation costs. I want to ensure that this tragedy does not negatively affect their lives any more than it has to by alleviating theextra financial burden that will inevitably accompany this life changing situation. My hope is for Dave and his family to be able to focus on what is truly important in life--each other. Please help me achieve this goal. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.Read more"

They brought him to the emergency room twice and on both occasions were told that he was exhibiting symptoms of teething. After waiting a few days, Lucas had become more agitated, lethargic and began exhibiting weakness in his legs. Lisa and Tim decided to leave vacation early so he could be seen by his pediatrician. Around 2:30 AM Friday, August 20th, Lisa heard Lucas fussing in his crib and went to check on him. After consoling him, he settled down but Lisa had an instinctual feeling that something wasn’t right. She brought Lucas back into his room and tried to have him stand-up while holding the side of his crib; a skill that he was previously doing independently. He immediately collapsed, falling onto the mattress. He was unable to stand or sit-up unsupported. Lisa and Tim immediately rushed him to Maria Ferrari Children's Hospital were Lucas underwent numerous tests including, bloodwork, CT scans and a spinal tap. All of these tests came back inconclusive. The doctor's then ordered an MRI to further investigate the cause of the paralysis. One hour into the MRI, the doctors abruptly stopped the test. They had found a large clot on Lucas’ spinal column. They were notified that surgery was absolutely necessary if there was a chance Lucas would be able to use his legs again. Lucas endured a six hour operation to remove the clot. The reason for the clot is still unknown and is being called a spontaneous spinal hematoma. The neurosurgeon was confident that the clot had been removed successfully, however due to the location of the clot Lucas began having difficulty breathing on his own. Lucas was intubated and sedated for 10 days. After numerous consultations, it was determined that it would be in Lucas’ best interest to have a tracheostomy to help restore independent breathing ability. Lucas began his journey to rehabilitation on Monday, September 12th at the Children's Specialized Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He will be receiving inpatient speech/feeding therapy, occupational therapy and physical therapy for at least 8 weeks to help restore leg movement, breathing abilities and feeding/swallowing skills.Lisa and Tim are sincerely grateful for everyone’s support, prayers and encouragement. There has been an out-pouring of requests by family, friends and co-workers wanting to know how they can help. This fund has been established by Lisa and Tim’s family to help them with medical expenses, commuting expenses and the costs of everyday life. We encourage family and close friends to help contribute in any way possible. This fund has been posted by Chris Long, Lisa’s brother.

Cody got to come home today from the rehabilitation center. They aren't really able to do alot of tharapy with him at this time because of not having use of his hands and leg because of being broken, so they sent him home and a nurse will be coming out 3x a week. He is so happy to be home with his family and we are all happy to have him home. He won't be able to walk for 3 months because of his foot having a steel plate in it due to it being shattered and 3 months for his fractured c2 and c5. Still a long road to recovery but he will get there with the help of his family and friends. We did have to make a wheelchair ramp and buy medical equipment for him to be home and it's well worth all the work to have him here. We want to Thank everyone from the bottom of our hearts for all of your donations and shares. This has helped him so much with bills supplies, food, and now his medications. If we could just keep sharing to meet our goal to help keep them a float for a few more months until they are able to get back to work.

We have never ask for help but have always been the family that helps others. Unfortunately today we are asking for help for our own family. My son has been in a terrible car accident and is in ICU and is going through surgeries and possibly more surgeries. He is in serious condition. He was the only one working at the time and supporting his family of 4 soon to be 5. His fiance is due next month and has complications with the pregnancy so is unable to work much. He has a 5 year old and 1 and a half year old and about to have a newborn. He will be down for months with the prayers of God that he makes a full recovery. We are helping as much as we can as a family but we need extra help. We are asking for donations to help with his utilities, food, etc. We are not asking for help with medical bills at this time but could be at a later date. If you could please donate to this beautiful caring and kind hearted family to aliminate some of their stress we would be so grateful. And remember even a little could make a difference. Thank you all in advance and I will update any information at a later date.Read more"

JP and his friend Callum had been on a charity cycle ride from John O'Groats in Scotland to Land's End in Cornwall, the length of the UK! They had cycled 880 out of 1000 miles and were on the last two days of their ride. Tragically, JP was hit by a car in a hit-and-run collision by a previously disqualified driver who fled the scene.The car hit him with such force, he went over the car, flew over the barriers and was wedged in between a tree and the barrier. His bike was shattered into pieces.He was airlifted from North Devon to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth with two badly broken legs, a fractured arm and potentially life threatening internal injuries.JP is still in Intensive Care, having suffered serious internal organ injuries, including a perforated bowel, and has since undergone multiple complex surgeries.He has subsequently developed a nasty chest infection which has caused breathing problems as well as irregular heartbeat. He remains in huge amounts of pain. We are so devastated by what happened to JP. We have created this Go Fund Me page to give back in a time of vulnerability to a wonderful human being who has selflessly given so much to so many throughout his life. Since the accident many people have reached out with stories of how JP has positively affected them. Donations will help him with the legal, medical and other expenses incurred due to the loss of his livelihood while he recovers. Once he is out of intensive care and hospital, JP will require extensive rehabilitation to heal and recover from this traumatic event. As an athlete, fitness is his life so this is going to be devastating for him. We are hoping to raise enough funds to be able to assist him with quality supplements, nutrients, therapies and treatments he will require. It will no doubt be a long road to recovery for him and he will not be able to work for the foreseeable future.His devoted wife Julia has been so loving and caring by his bedside since the accident, encouraging him and will be supporting him full time during his recovery. We are appealing to your compassion and generosity. This loving, kind and generous man deserves a chance to receive our help. As a talented motivational speaker and coach, JP will continue to change and influence countless lives in the future with his inspirational example.

Unbeknownst to his family, he fell and landed just wrong on his head and neck. His youngest son, Zack, found him around midnight with blood pooled around his head. What the family felt was a routine trip to the ER to check for a concussion became much more. After numerous tests and MRIs, it was shown that Randy had a spinal cord contusion on his C3/C4. Randy underwent surgery on March 27 to remove the C3 and place a stabilizer in his spinal cord. Randy’s injury resulted in limited movement of his shoulders, upper arms, legs and feet. His trunk and diaphragm are very weak making breathing hard. The greatest hope in Randy’s recovery is to regain full use of his hands.Randy was moved to J.W. Sommers Rehab Facility on March 31. True rehabilitation will not begin until his spinal cord has healed. This could take several weeks, and then rehab could be 3 to 6 months or longer. Due to his extensive rehab, Randy will not be able to work the job he so enjoys as the manager of Cracker Barrel in Florence, Alabama.As with any injury, one of the greatest challenges is the financial aspect. Randy does have insurance that covers a percentage of his rehab. However, he is missing a portion of his income due to not physically being able to be present in the store.This gofundme account is being set up to assist Randy, Kim and their sons as they travel this long road to recovery. If you know the Duttons, you know how selflessly they help and give to those around them. Randy and Kim have a deep faith in the Lord, and they know He will provide all their needs.My son, pay attention to what I say; turn your ear to my words.

On August 6th 2020, Jenn was at home cooking dinner for her family like any other normal day when she had a significant sized seizure that sent her to the ER. In the emergency room, they did a full work up and found a mass in her brain. The doctors went to action immediately, unsure from MRI results if it truly was a tumor or an infection. The next day August 7th Jenn had a craniotomy where it was confirmed to be a tumor that was removed and sent out for pathology. At that moment the fight for her life started.Myself along with 3 of Jenn's other friends had every intention of writing a story to put this into perspective and to captivate your heart, but her husband Matt said it best and I hope his words speaks to your heart and encourages you to help Jenn and her family win this fight. Here are Matt's words ;""Jenn has been transferred to her rehabilitation hospital to begin physical, speech, and occupational therapy. She will be working hard for the next 10-12 days to regain her strength and dexterity. I feel for Jenn's speech therapist because Jenn loves to talk and focus has never been a strong suit.We have received the pathology on Jenn's tumor and it's unfortunately heartbreaking. The tumor is called and Glioblastoma Category 4 (GBM), which is an aggressive form of cancer. The treatment for this cancer is 6 weeks of chemotherapy and radiation everyday followed by 6 months of further chemotherapy. Her doctor is looking into trial cancer treatments in other states as there are no trial treatments in Arizona at this time.Jenn has a David vs Goliath battle in front of her but I don't think cancer knows who it's picking on. Everyone who knows Jenn describes her as the toughest and most determined person they know. When we first met all those years ago I knew she was going to be a handful. Jenn is unique as she leads from the front of the group while never forgetting the people most vulnerable in the back. This is the very reason why she is so excellent at her job, working with detention facilities, courts, probation and police departments statewide on alternatives to juvenile detention. Jenn is determined to get back to work making a difference for the State of Arizona and nationwide.Our two brave soldiers, Aaron and Ashur, have taken the news as best they can. Just two weeks ago we moved Aaron to Stillwater, Oklahoma for the veterinarian doctoral program at OSU. Ashur has started 4th grade which is an online regiment.Jenn is intent on beating this, but even the toughest person needs help. Thank you all for your messages and contributions of love and support. Jenn sees these messages and it lifts her heart.Our fight is going to last several months to many years. During these times we will have many victories and possibly some setbacks. Many of you may not know Jenn personally, but after this you will be amazed by Jenn's tenacity.No matter what is ahead, I know she is going to fight and I will be there every step of the way fighting with her. Thank you for your continued support.""Please know that any donation big or small is going directly into beating this cancer and prolonging Jenn's life for as long as possible, and if a donation is not possible for you, please just share her story. Through her journey we will continue to update her story here. So keep a look out for updates, photos and videos.Thank you,Audra#FightWithJenn#CancerShouldBeScaredRead more"

I am hoping to raise money to help ease the burden of bills when they come out of the hospital so they can focus on their healing and recovery. At the moment I am not sure how much medical bills will be but will put any and all funds raised to pay for both my mom and brother's medical expenses. I also hope to be able to pay for our rent for this last month as well as the next few months. Please share, send healing thoughts, light and candle, and if possible donate ANYTHING you can.Here are the details of their condition:My mom went into the Emergency Room with COVID-19 symptoms and was immediately admitted into the ICU at St. Lukes in Phoenix Arizona. She was requiring 45% oxygen support. She was put onto a ventilator for 2 weeks and just a few days ago (January 25th) she was taken off of the ventilator! She has lost a lot of weight, weighing only 80 lbs, and is still in the ICU. Soon she will start rehabilitation to be able to sit up and move.My brother Jonathan who is 24 was experiencing severe COVID-19 symptoms and after seeing that he was not getting any better at home went to the Emergency Room at Valleywise Medical Center. He too was admitted immediately into the ICU and put onto a ventilator to fully support his lung function. Without much improvement, he was transported to Phoenix Children's Hospital to undergo ECMO to oxygenate his blood. Because of the possible infections related to keeping someone intubated through the mouth he yet again had to undergo a procedure, this time a tracheostomy. He remains on a tracheostomy ventilator. Recently he was transported to St. Judes Hospital for long term care.I am not sure what the future holds but am hoping for both my brother and mom to recover so we can be together once again. My Mom is an avid hiker, yogi, and all around best mom to her two boys. My Brother is amazing and has always looked out for me. If you can help our family out I would greatly appreciate it.With love and appreciation,EliasHola a todos,Desde Enero 11 mi madre y mi hermano se están debatiendo sus vidas en terapia intensiva como consecuencia de COVID-19. Espero poder reunir suficiente dinero para poder absorber los costos de sus internaciones de los hospitales para quepuedan enfocarse en susanación completa. Hasta ahora, no sé cuál será el costo derivado de las hospitalizaciones. Los ventilators, medicinas, terapias, las salas de Terapia Intensiva, y además los costos de su recuperación. Espero reunir suficiente como para poder sostener los gastos de la renta de nuestro departamento por este mes y los siguientes hasta que se recuperen y puedan volver a sus vidas cotidianas de trabajo. Por favor, compartan nuestra historia, envíen sus oraciones de sanación para mi madre Marcela y mi hermano Jonathan, prendan un cirio en sus nombres, y si les es posible, envíen sus donaciones de ayuda. ¡Cualquier cantidad es bienvenida, lo que se pueda por más pequeña la cantidad, será una gran ayuda para nosotros!Aquí les comparto la historia de mi mamá, Marcela y de mi hermano Jonathan:Mi mama se enfermo con COVID a principios de Enero, al ver que no se mejoraba, fue a la Emergencia del St.Luke Hospital en Tempe, Arizona, cerca de donde vivimos.Una vez allí, fue admitida inmediatamente en Terapia Intensiva, requiriendo 45% de oxígeno para ayudar a sus pulmones que estaban dejando ya de funcionar. Marcela estuvo intubada con el ventilator por dos semanas y hace unos días que está sin el ventilator pero con oxígeno ya que sus pulmones aún están muy débiles. Marcela, mi mamá, ha perdido mucho peso. Su peso actual es 80 libras, es por eso que aún se encuentraen terapia intensiva y se comenzará su rehabilitaciónfísicapara poder sentarse y comenzar a caminar otra vez.Mi hermano Jonathan, 24, fue admitido en otro hospital de Phoenix, AZ unos pocos días antes que mi mamá. Sus síntomas eran más severos al ser admitido en Terapia Intensiva e intubado inmediatamente. Después de unos días surgieron complicaciones, por las que fue trasladado al Phoenix Children Hospital de Phoenix. Allí recibió un tratamiento llamado ECMO para oxigenar su sangre. Para prevenir mas complicaciones debido a estar intubado por boca por un tiempo prolongado, Jonathan fue sometido a una traqueotomía para ser intubado directamente desde su tráquea. Así se encuentra desde hace unas semanas ya. Recientemente fue admitido en el Hospital de St. Jude para tratamiento prolongado.No sé qué nos depara el futuro, pero tengo la esperanza de que mi mamá y mi hermano se recuperen y podamos estar reunidos una vez más. Mi madre es una persona que disfruta de sus largas caminatas por las montañas de Phoenix, es una yogi, espiritual y super fuerte. Siempre enfrenta la vida con optimismo y compasión para todos, ella es la mejor mamáque Dios me pudo haber dado. Mi hermano Jonathan es un chico maravilloso, lleno de vida, música y siempre protegiéndome y dándome su apoyo como hermano mayor. Si ustedes pueden ayudar a mi familia, se los agradeceré con creces. Ya forman parte de la recuperación de mi mama y de mi hermano.Muchísimas gracias por leer mi historia. ¡Que Dios y el Universo los bendiga por su generosidad!Con afecto,EliasRead more"

Jake’s Mum has been my close friend since primary school back in South Africa and we have remained close all these years. Both our families now serendipitously live nearby on the Sunshine Coast where our children have become besties too.Concerned with a few random symptoms, Nicole and Paul took little Jake to their family Doctor for a checkup and within minutes of walking in the door were given a bleak report. An emergency MRI showed a 3.5cm mass deeply intertwined in his brain stem and the prognosis was grim!After a 7 hour surgery, only 70% of the tumour was able to be removed with the rest in too precarious a position. A “Grade 1 Pilocytic Astrocytoma” (JPA) which, thoughlabelled benign, is actually a form of rare cancer that is non aggressive, slow growing and contained to it’s location. The ramifications of this cancer are extensive and willlikelyimpact Jake for the rest of his life:· His movement and balance are affected – specifically the left side of his body.· Increased pressure within his brain means his brain fluid does not flow properly to the rest of his body. · Vomiting· Headaches· Double vision due to the pressure of swelling of his brain to his optic disc· Muscle weakness· Possible seizuresThough not an ‘aggressive’ cancer, JPAis just as insidious as it hijacks Jake’s childhood filling it with immediate daily and ongoing physio, speech therapy, occupational therapy, surgeries, eye specialist appointments, hospital stays and cancer treatments. All the while Nicole and Paul have shut down their businesses to become full time carers for Jake. Not only is this a huge financial burden without any income but they’ve temporarily relocated to Brisbane (an hour and a half from home) while their 5 year daughter, Jake’s sister remains with friends back on the coast - not seeingher beloved Jake, Mum and Dad for a week at a time. Neither Nicole nor Paul have any family close by, only friends who are desperate to help. Staunchly independant, they've granted me their reluctant permission to creat this campaign for everyone who'sexpressed helplessness but a desire to help. The most practical way to help this beautiful family is to fund Jake's cancer treatment and rehabilitation costs.These funds are desperately needed & will go a long way for them:· Not only covering mundane expenses like rent and the rest of their regular bills without any income· Cover the continual and ongoing daily out-of-pocket expenses that their health insurance will not cover for Jake’s physical requirements: Physio, speech therapy, occupational therapy, medication. · Fuel driving backwards and forwards from the Sunshine Coast to Brisbane weekly to see their daughter and bring her to visit her big brother. Currently (24 Sept) Jake is 6days post op:· Under 24/7 nursing observation.· His eyes are improving in strength but double vision is consistent. · The entire left side of his body is going to need intense rehabilitation· The drain in his head is being constantly adjusted to challenge the fluid pathways in his brain and body to adapt it’s ability to reabsorb. This, combined with the MRI next week will determine whether or not he will require surgery to insert a shunt from his brain to his stomach. The endless emergence of new, unanticipated obstacles that lie ahead of him are constantly challenging Nicole and Paul’s optimism but they never the less remain hopeful they will get their little boy back to a fully restored health and childhood. Childhood cancer is unfathomable but to happen to a tender hearted little boy whose response to the nurse asking him if he would like them to remove his bandage was “Yes please, if it’s not too much trouble?”Please support our friends by donating any amount that you can to ease the upheaval and heartache this has caused their otherwise, peaceful lives.**As per Go Fund Me's T&C's: I've been good friends with Nicole since Primary and we continue to be close friends as we live near one another on the Sunshine Coast. All funds collected are going straight to Nicole and Paul's joint bank account, being distributed directly from Go Fund Me to them. I have merely set this campaign up for them.

Little did we know what would be in store only 12 short hours later……….It still amazes us that Brian walked into that ER somehow although his blood oxygen level was so dangerously low it showed he was in respiratory distress. Fortunately, the ER staff moved quickly and admitted him to the ICU with severe double pneumonia. Of course, in this Covid rampant era, Jonathan (Brian’s partner) would not be allowed to accompany him to the ICU until Brian’s Covid test result returned negative. Jon never envisioned when he left the ER that day that the next time he saw Brian he’d be on a ventilator, in a medically induced coma. Jonathan would later learn, that after Brian transferred up to the ICU he coded on three separate occasions and the ICU staff didn’t expect him to survive. Brian’s doctors requested he give them approval to intubate, paralyze, and place him on a ventilator. Brian had to make that terrifying decision alone in the wee hours of the morning, which Jon would only learn of after he was unable to reach Brian on his mobile.After what seemed like the longest day of Jon's life, he finally received the call he had been waiting for from the hospital. Brian’s Covid test was negative and Jon would be given unrestricted access to visit and even stay with Brian in the ICU. The days and weeks which followed would be some of the most difficult for Jon but what he didn't know at the time, was even harder days were still ahead.Brian’s illness perplexed all of his doctors. Every specialist you can imagine consulted, and each test performed would come back negative. Brian was tested for everything they could think of since his body wasn’t responding positively to any of their efforts. Brian went into multiple organ failure, he would have high blood pressure followed by bouts of extremely low blood pressure, his kidneys were failing, his heart rate would spike and drop, and eventually his body developed Sepsis.Brian’s kidneys were not responding to daily dialysis so he was moved to 24-hour dialysis. He had been on countless rounds of antibiotics, steroids, pressers and so many, many other medications. He had Bronchoscopy, CT scans, x-rays, and multiply sputum tests. Brian’s body decided it had enough and went into A Fib Dec 30th (an irregular heartbeat) requiring him on two separate occasions needing to be paddled twice to get his heart back into a normal rhythm. And this was just what happened in the month of December.It would constantly be one step forward and two steps backward….extubating Brian on the 18th of December, only to intubate him again on the 23rd of December. It became clear after the New Year that Brian’s lungs were still severely damaged by the pneumonia and he would need more time on the ventilator to allow his lungs to heal. On January 5th Brian underwent a tracheotomy and a feeding tube was inserted. Brian slowly began showing small improvements beginning with his white blood count, he was even able to get back to regular daily dialysis. It seemed like the rollercoaster was finally coming to a halt on January 5th when it seemed Brian was just stable enough that he could be transferred to a special long term care hospital but Brian’s body disagreed and decided it still had time for one more long ass rollercoaster ride…..on January 11th Brian had a setback. He went from being stable enough for a transfer, to as gravely ill with pneumonia as his condition was when he first arrived in the ICU.Everything they worked through was gone in an instant and they were back to multiple organ failure, 24-hour dialysis again, on 100% oxygen and were unable to get Brian’s blood oxygen to an acceptable level. It seemed the pneumonia was worse than the first time. Brian’s doctors even had a Palliative Nurse speak with Jon. With Brian’s doctors nearly out of options, they opted to try pruning him once more (pruning places Brian upside down to try to help get the fluid off his lungs). But Jon, his family and friends continued to pray and never lost faith that Brian would be healed. The next couple of weeks were uncertain therefore all the small positive baby steps Brian took were celebrated until he was stable enough once again to move to the specialty long term care hospital.On January 28th Brian was transferred and the journey towards his recovery began.The facility Brian was moved to specialized in weaning patients off ventilators. Every day their team worked on reducing the amount of oxygen Brian needed, and eventually started alternating with a CPAP machine to begin exercising his lungs. On Feb 19th he began trials needed, in order to get off the ventilator and he started using a tracheostomy collar. The first day he got to 6 hours, the second day he did 12. In the following few days Brian would eventually get strong enough to stay on the collar 24 hours a day. He was finally classified as no longer needing mechanical ventilation.This seemed once like an impossible milestone but he finally reached this stage of his recovery.February 23rd a speaking valve was inserted to Brian’s trach and he was able to speak and hear his voice for the first time since December 10th. Brian then began working with a speech therapist on February 25th and was green lighted to have ice chips. He was even told the following week that he would do more tests to see when he would be ready to progress towards soft/solid foods. On March 1st Brian passed his swallow test and was approved to have food, without restrictions. Then on March 4th Brian’s trach collar was removed. He is now receiving supplemental oxygen only through his nose. It’s hard to imagine being bedridden a week much less 3 months. Although Brian’s been bedridden since December 10th, he’s super excited to have reached yet another milestone by starting physical therapy this week. Brian is now on another waiting list, hoping to be transferred next week to a Rehabilitation hospital where he will get 3 to 5 hours of physical therapy daily, in order to learn to do all the basic tasks again that we often take for granted. This aggressive stage of his recovery on average takes about 3 weeks. Once transferred, Brian will begin facing the difficult challenge ahead of re-learning how to use his body again, getting his hands & arms to work as they once did, re-learning how to once walk again and so on. There is still a long road to recovery ahead but Brian & Jon are beyond grateful and feel nothing short of blessed for the progress Brian’s made thus far. Jonathan has been right beside Brian all through this entire ordeal. Jon was out of work for 3 weeks when Brian was at his worst and again at each of his setbacks. Luckily, they do have medical insurance but they need some help financially to pay the 20% they are responsible for as well as their out of pocket deductible. Needless to say, this has also put a financial burden on Jon with only one source of income, given he’s the only one working. The first hospital submitted its bill of $640K, and the 2nd hospital submitted a partial bill of $394K. And this doesn't include any of the physician/specialist bills that have been received so far or we have yet to receive.In addition to all that has happened with Brian, during the Ice Storm in Dallas on Feb 19th a water pipe burst, flooding the first floor of their townhome.This fund was created to help with the financial hardship of the medical bills piling up and living expenses while Brian is receiving treatment and working towards recovering. Brian would like to thank you for reading this post and showing support in any way you can. Please also keep us in your thoughts and prayers.Read more"

Tragically, while diving for a goal in the yard, he misjudged the distance to a nearby wall. A minor league player in Georgia, he was in full goalie mode when he leapt for the ball and crashed into the wall, headfirst. Everything changed on that day. A beloved son, brother, uncle and friend, we are eager to see Giorgiimprove, though the prognosis is difficult, especially getting the level of care that he needs in his home country of Georgia. In the last six months, Giorgi has had three surgeries and had effectively been in a coma. After months of a seemingly hopeless situation, the doctors are beginning to report some improvements in his condition and cognition- which can only be improved in facilities that may be able to work with him. Unfortunately, such services do not exist in Georgia. After great efforts, his family and friends have been able to secure him a place in a rehabilitation center in Germany but the costs are more than they can manage despite the great generosity of many people that supported them until this time. We are hoping to gather the resources that Giorgi will need to travel to Germany by a medically equipped airplane and his rehabilitation in the clinic. These costs are estimated at approximately $120,000 USD.Any support that you can offer will be greatly appreciated and of course, if you have any questions or need any more information, please contact us.Read more"

In the brief weeks since Memorial Day, she has started headlong down a long road to recovery and has started making great progress in regaining her life. She is now out of the hospital, but cannot yet speak, cannot drive a car, and cannot (yet) work.A vigorous schedule of rehabilitation and challenges lay ahead for Pat: * She has multiple speech therapies per week, going twice per day some days* She has physical therapy to regain her former fighting shape* During the ""downtime"" she has, she is working with a few amazing apps on the Ipad that greatly increase her capability to improve during the first weeks of recovery. (The first 30-60 days of stroke recovery tend to hold most of the recovery of skills)* She is joining a support group of people who have been the victims of strokes, and going to meet this group out in Wheaton a couple times per week.What can you do to help?Outside of your prayers and well wishing, you can help Pat sprint through this 30-60 days stretch.What Will WeDo With The Funds Raised Here?1) Pay for the $100 a day co-pay to facilitate speech and physical therapy2) Get Pat to and from therapy, groups, and to see doctors.

These aren't $2 apps, many cost hundreds of dollars!4) Bridge anygap between her last paychecks and the short term disability.
The aformentioned apps allow her to communicate right now by forming sentences with pictures, while simultaneously regrowing synapses in her brain to associate things with words and syllabals. Other apps will allow her to practice speaking, pronounciation, and vocabulary. Some apps stimulate her hand-eye-brain coordination by letting her practice writing and typing.
Sadly, insurance will not cover apps for an iPad, despite doctor recommendations and proven successes.

She had just returned from working at a Dog Herding event that she had attended for three days. She was planning to spend her retirement years working in and attending Dog Herding events and competitions. The next minute she began to feel dizzy, had trouble breathing, and was experiencing pain. She tried to stand up, but her legs gave way and she collapsed. She couldn't feel her legs. Cindy called 911 and was rushed to the hospital. I received a call that my sister was in emergency surgery and they were not sure if she was going to make it. Calling my siblings was so hard, but not being able to go to the hospital to be with her, due to Covid-19 was the worst. Thankfully, Cindy survived the surgery. She was on a breathing machine and in the intensive care unit, heavily sedated. Her lung collapsed, and we knew she wasn't out of the woods yet. My siblings and I hoped for the best. When Cindy woke up, she could not feel anything from the waist down. She began ripping the I.V.'s from her arms. They decided she needed to be sedated again for her own safety. If you know Cindy, then you know, she is a happy, tough, take no bull kind of girl. This journey she is now on is so heartbreaking to see. She remained in intensive care for a while, and when I finally could speak to her by phone, all she could ask, was ""when are you taking me home? I need to see my dogs!"" She recently was transferred to Ballard Rehabilitation Hospital, but they will be discharging her soon, and she will have to go home. Life is going to be substantially altered for my dear sister and our family. We cannot do it alone.Cindy is going to have to learn to sit up, and is currently working on getting her strength back. At this point, she has been told to prepare for a life as a paraplegic. This news is disheartening and with all of the new stem-cell therapies, we will remain hopeful that she will get to run and walk with her dogs again. All things are possible, and I believe in miracles.So, here's where Cindy needs your help. Cindy's house will have to become wheelchair friendly ASAP, like yesterday! She is going to have some major expenses such as, medical equipment, home renovations so that she can enter her bathroom and of course will she need a wheelchair entry shower. Counters will eventually need to be lowered and who knows what else. None of this will be covered by health insurance. She will need constant care, for some time. She cannot be alone, and at this point she can't drive, and basically is going to need full time live-in care. If you know Cindy, then you know she has the biggest heart and is always willing to help anyone, be it a fellow human being, or a two or four-legged animal. Growing up with Cindy as a big sister, made me believe she was invincible. I know I am not alone in wanting Cindy to walk again and run with her animals, which are so dear to her.Donations are desperately needed to fund Cindy's recovery, immediate needs and future needs. Her self-esteem is low, but understandable given the situation that she now faces. Please join me in showing Cindy how much we love and care for her. We will also be looking into stem cell therapies which are costly, but, we believe will enable her to be back to her old self and walking again. Thank you for keeping my sister, Cindy Easley in your thoughts.Read more"

As a result, he sustained severe traumatic brain injury threatening his life. The injury caused, as medically described, Subdural and Subarachnoid hemorrhages that further aggravated damage to his brain, in particular left side of the brain including the frontal lobe. The expert and efficient neurosurgeon and staff at the University Medical Center (UMC) were able to save his life, however, now he has been in the Neuro ICU at UMC on life support, and has been bravely battling for his life.Just to share a little on who David is… David was born to ‘The Vartak Family’. We are from Mumbai, India and he is our only child. A sportsman, athlete and student, he always demonstrated a “never give-up attitude”. In the fall of 2015, after having completed his Bachelors in Microbiology and Biochemistry and his Masters in Biomedical Genetics, a researcher at heart, he was accepted in a PhD program at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC), Lubbock Texas where he embarked on pursuing his dream scientific career in Cancer Research.As aptly described by his PhD mentor, David is an innovator, and someone who is on a mission to generate new knowledge to save lives of cancer patients. Evidently, upon making a ground breaking discovery in Breast Cancer Research while working in his lab, David was looking forward to completing his Doctorate in May 2020, when his dream was tragically interrupted by the traumatic brain injury.A continuous flow of family and friends visiting David in the Neuro ICU is testimony to how loved he has been. Unknown people have been speaking highly of him and how he has helped them in their time of need during the past 4 ½ years at TTUHSC. He not only wrote recommendation letters for people who needed a job but also mentored several students in his lab. Being a foodie, he cooked for many, helped first time international students from the airport to the university giving them a meal and making them feel comfortable. From the President of the TTUHSC (as he was elected for 2 years as a student senator) to the Cleaning staff whom he warmly greeted every morning, they know David as a bright scientist as well as a kind and humble person. David deserves our support in his fight for life, and a second chance to realize his dream of saving lives of patients with cancer. We need YOU to help us see the bright side of this dark tunnel…….We need your support to help him make it back to the world of normalcy and just return to being with us again. We, his parents, ask you to pray for David, and to support us by your kind and life-saving contribution toward his medical costs. We must move him from the ICU to a specialty Nursing Home, and then transport him to a Rehab Centre for Long Term Care post-Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Your contribution will be utilized for his medical expenses incurred in excess of his insurance coverage, rehabilitation and care, and for the living expenses of his parents who moved here from India.We thank you for your prayers, love and generosity. We, David’s parents, also confirm that Mrs. Mugdha Vartak has been nominated to organize and withdraw funds to support David’s life-recovery efforts.Read more"

With your continued support, we can make 2018 a wonderful year for them. We wanted to let you know that the Santa Rosa sanctuary property is in escrow now. We continue to move forward with our ongoing Shelter Animal Rescue, Animal Hospice / Critical Care and Animal Hospice & Holistic Education programs. We're also investigating the possibility of partnering with 3-4 other like-minded individuals or animal welfare organizations to create a specialized sanctuary and hospice for senior and special needs animals. Please read the below October 2017 Update for more details. ***OCTOBER 2017 UPDATE***BrightHaven wants to thank each of you for your financial support and friendship. Your generous and loving contributions recently helped us raise nearly $60,000 in efforts to sustain the BrightHaven sanctuary. Those funds enabled us to keep paying the mortgage, keep the sanctuary doors open and keep the animals fed and cared for--for the time being. Sadly, it is not enough for the BrightHaven Sanctuary to remain open for the long term.In order to ensure that there is a secure and sustainable future for the entire BrightHaven organization, we have made the decision to sell the Santa Rosa sanctuary property and seek a new way forward with the net funds from the sale.IMPORTANT FACT FOR YOU, OUR CHERISHED SUPPORTERS: No matter what, our animals are our top priority and we will find loving homes for them if needed. Also, absolutely NO animals will be euthanized as part of moving forward if we no longer have the sanctuary property.BrightHaven's New Way ForwardOur future may not include a physical sanctuary, although we are exploring the possibility of partnering with 3-4 other like-minded individuals or animal welfare organizations to create a specialized sanctuary and hospice for senior and special needs animals. These parties would form a consortium where we would work together and pool financial resources and years of experience and knowledge for the benefit of animals. If you would like to learn more about this exciting opportunity, please email Richard Pope at [email redacted].Again, the BrightHaven organization is NOT going away! We have cared for unwanted and abandoned animals for the last 30 years and we will continue serving senior, disabled and chronically ill animals, and the humans who love them.Please rest assured that any remaining funds from your contributions to our campaign will be added to our net funds from the property sale and be used to serve animals with our ongoing programs: 1) Shelter Animal RescueBrightHaven Shelter Animal Rescue will continue to specialize in the rescue, foster care and fospice, rehabilitation and adoption of senior and special needs animals most at risk for euthanasia. This program has always been run out of private homes and is not dependent on a physical sanctuary location.2) Animal Hospice / Critical Care BrightHaven animal hospice provides animals with specialized holistic hospice care. Gail will continue to provide this service for our existing critically ill and hospice residents in her private home.3) Animal Hospice & Holistic EducationBrightHaven will continue to offer and expand our comprehensive educational program, based on knowledge and core expertise gleaned whilst caring holistically for senior, chronically ill and disabled animals, and for animals with a short life expectancy. This program is not dependent on a physical sanctuary location.If you have any questions or concerns about our new direction, please contact Gail at [email redacted].We are truly grateful for your generous support, and we will be sending out more updates as our strategy takes shape. Together, we will continue to give the gift of tomorrow to many more precious animals and carry on this important work.***MAY 2017 UPDATE***Help us secure our animals’ future and serve more animals in need! We are so amazed and grateful for the astounding outpouring of love, honor and respect for the work of BrightHaven. Caring, compassionate people like you are coming forward to help restructure our operations and initiate new streams of revenue; AND, in a relatively short time, over $55K has been raised! As a result, the sanctuary will remain open. HOWEVER, to secure the future for our existing animal residents, and to allow us to serve more animals in desperate need of help, we still have a lot of work ahead. Your help is essential for our success. To honor this exciting new phase, we have changed the name of our campaign to ""Giving Animals the Gift of Tomorrow” from “Save the BrightHaven Animals”. We truly appreciate your care and support! ***ORIGINAL PLEA*** Losing BrightHaven's one-of-a-kind animal sanctuary due to unexpected financial challenges would be a great loss to the community and the many more animals who would have been served by our work, in addition to the significant negative impact closure would have on current animal residents! Since 1990, unwanted, old, disabled and chronically ill animals have found love, acceptance, family and a safe haven for life at BrightHaven (www.brighthaven.org). We have saved over 1,000 senior, disabled and chronically ill animals by giving them the gift of a loving and dignified home for life—however long or short that life may be. BrightHaven has also rescued and helped thousands more animals through its various programs. Why We Need Your HelpAfter nearly 30 years of taking in and helping the most vulnerable beings among us in their time of need, the BrightHaven sanctuary is now in dire need of its own. BrightHaven’s Northern California sanctuary is in serious danger of closing its doors soon, as a major donor who generously paid the property mortgage since 2014 is no longer able to do so. We need help to make these payments. Also, without additional funds, BrightHaven will be unable to make essential repairs to the sanctuary property to keep it in proper working order for the animals.Our animals share what BrightHaven means to them: With your generous help, BrightHaven can keep our doors open and continue our work to save defenseless, priceless beings like Bailey and Talya, who would not be alive today without our sanctuary. Bailey, a BrightHaven Favorite Bailey is our special world traveler, who came to us all the way from the streets of Taiwan! A lovely couple rescued him from almost certain death in 2009 and contacted BrightHaven. Bailey has touched the hearts of many since he arrived at his new home.Bailey has a broken back, most likely from being hit by a car while living on the streets, and his hind legs are paralyzed. When he’s not in his wheelchair, Bailey’s favorite place is on the sofa where he can keep an eye on all of the activity going on around him. Bailey also loves to feel the wind in his fur as he zooms fearlessly around in his cart. Look at him go!Talya the Invincible Born in 2007, Talya’s back was broken when, while nursing from her mother, she was hit by furniture thrown from an apartment window above. Talya suffers occasional and serious bladder and kidney trouble, but her spirit remains strong and tough!This beautiful girl can best be summed up by adjectives such as strong, vibrant, feisty, loving and passionate. Many visitors to BrightHaven have been charmed by and lost their hearts to this incredible monkey with her inherent sweetness and surprising gymnastic ability as she scoots faster than most can walk, climbs the highest cat trees, adores her life with a passion and never hesitates to bite if she feels her wishes are not being respected. See for yourself what Talya can do! If we all work together we can give the gift of tomorrow to many more precious animals and carry on this important work.

In Feb 2021, Andrew was diagnosed with a brain tumor (hemangioblastoma, tumor of the blood vessels in the brain) and had an emergency surgery a week later (3/2/2). It was a difficult surgery but the NeuroSurgeon is hopeful that he removed the entire tumor and Andrew can make a full recovery. As of 3/7/21 Drew is stabilized but still not awake and he is facing a long road to recovery. 


Drew’s currently on leave from work and is receiving a percentage of his regular pay. He’s also facing very extensive rehabilitation to gain mobility. We’re all very hopeful, but it’s uncertain as to what lies ahead.  

Luckily he does have medical insurance, however there are still out of pocket expenses and a large deductible (on top of less income).


Kelly is also taking time away from her job to stay with Drew in ICU, as well as caring for their kids, Julia and Austin.


Kelly’s a devoted wife & mom and spends little time taking care of herself. It would be amazing if we can help this loving family so they can worry less about finances and focus on Drew’s recovery. 


If you’re able and willing to pitch in, during this difficult time, it would ease one burden. 


If you’re unable to donate, please know your continued prayers and kind words have been so comforting. 


Thank you,Leah

In fact she was working out with her boot camp group when the stroke hit her brain stem, making her unconscious, which is how she has remained so far. Her husband, dad, son and brother have been at her side in Kingston ever since and her expanded family have been rallying their support.Update April 8On behalf of Amber and her family we would like to thank everyone for their amazing generosity and would like to take this opportunity to explain a little of what is happening to her. Amber’s stroke has caused a condition known as “locked in syndrome”.What this means in “real terms” is that the part of Amber’s brain that makes her the person that we all know and love, is still fully intact and she is fully aware of what is happening to her.Unfortunately the stroke damaged a part of her brain “stem”, which means that she is unable to voluntarily access and control her body. She is fully aware of this, which we can only imagine must be like living a daily nightmare, as she struggles to rejoin the life and family she loves.Amber has been in the stroke ward at Kingston General Hospital for the past 5 weeks while the neurologists and medical team evaluate her condition and her progress and plan what needs to happen next.She is a fighter and has made visible progress. She can smile when Logan comes to visit and has managed controlled movements of her thumb, toes and head. She communicates with family through eye blinks, two for YES and one for NO. She is perfectly capable of making her wishes known, so I will be planting marigolds this Summer in her garden planters.Planning the next step has been very troublesome. There is really very little appropriate rehabilitation for people who are “locked in”. She requires a very intensive, multi dimensional program to help her recover as much of her control as she can. After spending many hours trying and failing to find her a place locally, the family has applied to the Shirley Ryan Ability Lab in Chicago where they specialize in “locked in syndrome” recovery. They have an excellent reputation and a higher than average success rate. We feel that offering Amber every opportunity to have as a full a future as we can give her is paramount and we feel that whatever expenditure is necessary to achieve that is the least we can do to help in her battle.We are optimistic that when she has made good progress she will be able to return to the Toronto area to continue her rehab.So thanks to all for helping us to offer Amber the very best chance for recovery and helping her to look forward to enjoying the company of all of her friends in the near future.Read more"

Chris dove into a wave that was stronger than he anticipated and was forced down, rolling his head forward and hitting his neck on the sand below. At first, we were unaware of what had happened, but when Chris took too long to get up from the water, his best friend Sam Marshall went to help him stand. Chris quickly told us that he couldn’t stand or feel anything, and we immediately carried him out of the water and onto the beach where a lifeguard quickly stabilized him and called 9-1-1.Chris was rushed to Jersey Shore University Medical Center, where it was determined that he had shattered his C6 vertebrae in his neck and had no sensation from the chest down. He underwent a 6-hour emergency spinal surgery where the fragments of shattered vertebrae were removed, and his C5 & C7 vertebrae were fused together. During surgery it was discovered that a fragment of bone had punctured the sac protecting his cerebrospinal fluid, but fortunately they were able to repair it.Currently Chris is sedated and on a ventilator, to assist his breathing while his body rests and heals.The silver lining of this situation is:When he is not sedated and intubated, Chris is able to breathe on his own. He also has sensation and limited use of his hands; however, he will need to completely relearn how to use them. Most importantly, his brain was not injured during the accident. When he is awake, he is in extremely good spirits and is 125% determined to walk again. He also keeps referring to himself as “a miracle” which everyone agrees, he is in fact an absolute miracle.For those of you who don’t know him, here’s a little bit about my awesome cousin:- Chris is 22 years old and just graduated Montclair State University in May of 2020, with a B.F.A. in Theatre and was a Dean’s List student.- Chris has already started to build quite the reputation in his field and has had the incredible opportunity to work with Production Resource Group (PRG), The Santa Fe Opera, The Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade and many more.- Chris is one of the kindest, most genuine people you will ever meet. He is brutally honest, incredibly quick witted, funny and passionate. He is also an activist, Electrician and aspiring Lighting Designer with a passion for stand-up comedy, art, music, books and he is incredibly proud of his Jersey roots.- Chris was raised by 2 of the most wonderful and loving people on the planet, Mike and Mary Ferranti. Mike and Mary have spent day in and day out at his bedside, supporting and encouraging him endlessly. He is an only child and the closest thing I have to a brother.While the future looks a little blurry right now, we are all incredibly inspired by Chris’s spirit, tenacity and unbelievably positive disposition, despite the uncertainty of the long road ahead.Chris currently remains in I.C.U. and it is unknown at this time how long he will need to remain hospitalized. He will require extensive physical therapy and rehabilitation after he is released from the hospital so that he is able to relearn how to do everything from writing his name to walking. His parents will also need to take time off work to help aid in his care and ongoing treatment as well as make some accommodations to their home to suit Chris’s needs as he moves forward in his recovery journey.Today, I am starting this fund to help lift some of the financial uncertainty and stress from weighing on Chris and his parent as they traverse this new path to rehabilitation and recovery. We know that times are hard and that not everyone feels they have enough to make a difference, but in a situation like this, every little bit counts and helps lift some weight from their shoulders during the scariest time in their lives. Thank you for your time and generosity. Please say a little prayer for Chris and his Mom and Dad.

He was rushed to Northcrest Medical Center and then transferred to Vanderbilt, where he remains. Vanderbilt doctors are telling us that he had a blood clot in his neck (as a result of COVID). This blood clot traveled to his brain, causing the massive stroke. Due to the intensity of the stroke, intervention was not possible. His brain began to swell and they had to release the pressure by removing part of his skull. We are currently waiting to see how he responds. We have been told by the doctors that IF he gets through this, he will require intensive rehabilitation. We know that God has the final word and we are continuing to pray that a miracle happens for our beloved husband, father, grandfather, friend, and community member.3 weeks prior to Johnny's massive stroke, my father passed away. Initially, we were told he was suffering from cancer. Our family was called in to say our goodbyes one last time prior to him passing. Most of our immediate family was able to visit my father before he passed. The day that he passed, we learned that he was actually suffering from COVID related illness. Since that time, the majority our immediate family has tested positive for COVID and some have been hospitalized. Due to the wide spread COVID outbreak among our family, we are unable to visit Johnny at this time. This has been an added hardship as we are unable to be with him during this difficult time. Additionally no one in the household is able to work at this time.We have a long road ahead of us, but know that God has our family in his hands.

For me personally one of the strongest people I know.If you know him, you love him.He spent 21 years in the Army deployed for more years than I would like to count to countries that weren’t always so happy we were there. He was shot at daily, hit by an IED, and Lord knows so many other things that go left unsaid, but always came home in one piece.He is a survivor.Whether he was out hunting, jet skiing, tinkering with something in the garage, or making my house project ideas come to life he was always active.Until July 30th at 248PM.I had to make the worst phone call I have ever had to make. As I lay there on the sandy shore next to my husband listening to the 911 dispatcher tell me that the EMTs were on their way our friends Steve starts chest compressions, Claudia performs the breaths, and Alicia sprints up to the road to flag the EMTs down.What seems like hours was actually only minutes.Finally we hear faint labored breaths from Steven as the EMTs arrive. The next thing I know is they have him in a neck brace and rolled on to a backboard with a helicopter waiting to life flight him out.It all happened so fast, but so slow at the same time.The rest is a blur. He leaves in the helicopter, a Park Ranger gets me back to camp and another to the Wenatchee hospital. I arrive just in time to see him before he goes to surgery to remove bones from his spinal cord and fuse C5-7. Diagnosis: broken neck.This is going to be a long night, and an even longer fight. His prognoses and expected recovery timeline are like a moving needle that we simply cannot seem to put our finger on.We will get him stabilized with one more surgery in Wenatchee. Then off to Seattle for some aggressive physical therapy. It’s overwhelming to think about all the ways our life will change. His life is built on mobility. From the house we live in to the hobbies he enjoys and everything in between. The hospital bills alone, even with healthcare, are quickly mounting to numbers I can’t even fathom.Nothing prepares you for this, nothing. Although the details of our future may be unclear I know my Steven and he is strong and determined. This is a plot twist but not the end of his story.We are asking for your help to cover the costs of medical stays, rehabilitation facilities and daily activity modifications to transition his life into one that is different, but still his own.Read more"

We thank you for your contribution to Angel’s gofund me and we ask that you please share the link on your social media platform.On May 7th, Angel went to the emergency room because of a fever and respiratory distress brought on by Covid-19. 

Everything happened really fast, he was admitted to Morristown hospital and soon after he was intubated. His health kept deteriorating and he was put on a ventilator for 7 weeks. He suffered complications with a brain aneurism that caused paralyses on the right side of his body. Doctors are hopeful that this is only temporary and that he will regain mobility eventually. Angel is currently at a rehabilitation center, they say he might be there for 2 months before he gets to go home. 

Ángel’s family is overwhelmed with emotions, happy that he is recovering but stressed from all the after shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Returning from Bear Mountain, they were only two miles from homewhena mini-van suddenly pulled out of nowhere cutting them off, and changed their lives forever. We are all so grateful they survived the accident, however, their injuries are severe and life altering. The road to recovery for them will be long and filled with many challenges. Glenn took the brunt of the impact and is still in a coma with a serious traumatic brain injury. The extent and effects of his TBI will not be known until he awakens. In addition to his TBI, Glenn also suffered two collapsed lungs as well as numerous broken ribs and a fractured hip.  Stacey fractured her pelvis, numerous ribs and the lower part of her spine. She also suffered a severly broken ankle that has required two surgeries so far.  She will no doubt be laid up for quite some time and will require help. Today she was moved out of the ICU into the Step Down Unit. Yesterday on the way back from her CAT Scan she was wheeled into Glenn's room and saw him for the first time since the accident.

This morning (January 29th), wewere ready to make the overwhelmingly difficult decision of removing him from life support. However, our father started showing some cognitive and responsive improvement. Though, his recovery is still uncertain, his improvements give us hope. If he recovers, it will be a very long recovery process. Our father is a pillar of our family, both emotionally and financially.

His neurosurgeon was very pleased with the outcome and we had all anticipated that Joe would be home by Thanksgiving. Unfortunately, that was notthe case andthingsquickly took a turn for the worst. Early Thanksgiving morning, Joe began vomiting large amounts of blood. Afraid that he would aspirate, the medical team intubated him and a CT scan revealed that he had suffered a hemorrhagic stroke, ora ""bleeder"" as some refer to it. The family received a call fromone of theICU nursesat 5:00 am onThanksgiving morning, needingpermission for the neuro team to perform a craniectomy to relieve the intracranial pressure and allow them to access the source of the bleeding.Joe endured a 3-hour, life-saving surgery; however, not without many complications to ensue, including aspiration and resuscitation, double pneumonia and sepsis. It is truly a miracle that he survived. Joe spent just under two months in between the hospital and in-patient rehabilitation. He lost 50 pounds over this period of time as a feeding tube and Glucerna, for most of the duration, was his only sustenance. He was discharged from St. Joseph’s/Barrow’s Neurological in-patient rehab facility on January 17, 2017, but he has a very long road ahead of him. That being said, no one can predict when he will be able to return to the life he loves and his source of income…the music industry. His fiancé is doing what she can, financially, to ensure that the mortgage and household bills are take care of, but it is quite a load for her to take on by herself. Then, there are the hospital bills. Even with health insurance coverage, the medical bills that are streaming in are beyond overwhelming. Those benefits are reaching their limits.

She is currently at Atrium Health Hospital in Pineville, North Carolina, near where she and her husband, Brian, live. Unfortunately, Hava’s heart suffered a lot of damage so her cardio rehabilitation will be slow and challenging and she will have many lifestyle restrictions placed on her once she returns home. She will not be able to drive, she will not be able to climb stairs more than once a day, she will not be able to walk her dogs and, most significantly, Hava will be unable to return to work for the foreseeable future which will be a huge burden because Hava and Brian rely on two incomes to meet their financial obligations. Although Hava and Brian have incredibly supportive family, they live far from us which restricts our ability to provide essential support like transportation, meals, and other general care needs. Additionally, we expect that Hava and Brian will face significant continued health care costs related to this incident that go well above what insurance and our collective efforts can reasonably support.Hava’s doctors have explained that her recovery over the crucial next few months is largely dependent on her ability to focus on her health, rather than on the stresses of daily life. After receiving so many calls, texts, and emails requesting information about how to provide help, we decided to create this fundraiser. A contribution to this fund will, for example, help Hava and Brian pay for their significant medical bills, meal delivery, trips to and from doctors and therapists, and will help supplement their loss of income. We expect, that over the next few months, Hava’s health will steadily improve and, at some point, she will be back on her feet with her ability to do everything she has always done. But in the meantime, anything you can do to contribute and/or share this page will go a long way toward helping Hava get there. While Hava is focusing on recovering and Brian is focusing on work, Mommy, (Connie Gross) will be focusing on managing the withdrawals on their behalf.Thank you in advance for any type of support you can provide. ❤️Read more"

Holmes Braddock High School, was found unresponsive by his grandmother. Dwayne's older brother performed CPR until Miami Dade Fire Rescue arrived. Dwayne clinically died several times during the CPR efforts. He was transported to Jackson South Hospital where doctors determined Dwayne went into Cardiac Arrest. It was later determined that Dwayne had an undiagnosed heart disease called Wolff-Parkinson-White. This heart disease is extremely rare and went undetected, even though Dwayne was a high school athlete and in great shape. Dwayne was taken into the ICU with severe swelling to the entire brain. He was treated in the ICU for ten days until doctors later determined that there was no more that could be done and Dwayne would not survive this ordeal. Without hesitation, the family sought a second opinion from one of the top Neurologists in South Florida. The family was informed that Dwayne's condition was survivable, but the road to recovery would be very long and steep. Since that day, Dwayne has missed his high school graduation and has been in the ICU fighting for a second chance at life. Dwayne has been moved to Promise Hospital (a long-term healthcare facility) where he is still suffering from the effects of multiple cardiac episodes; however, he is receiving treatment for his condition. Dwayne will require this type of treatment for several months not including rehabilitation and home nursing. Although Dwyane has health insurance, the medical expenses for long-term treatment far exceed what the insurance will cover. Please continue to pray for Dwyane and his family.

Kayla's routine was 6 am wake-up and usually she'd roll out of bed at 6:15. Then she'd check on Ryker, subtly arouse him from slumber by turning on his bedroom light and listen to the news as personal hygiene and dressing rituals were completed. The night prior she had worked late and she contemplated calling in since she was scheduled to start a new job on Monday anyways. Kayla is a driven, committed, smart and compassionate person who leads from the mother effing front! She wouldn't allow herself to soften up to the opportunity of taking it easy. Kayla wouldn't be too concerned about causing her coworkers to adapt to staffing situations. She is more concerned with the resident's she has been in care of for the past few years. Kayla is proud of being an accomplished Certified Therapeutic Recreation Specialist. To her, calling in means letting two floors worth of residents down at Loretto Health and Rehabilitation.Ryker was dropped off for preschool in Rome, NY between 730-745am most weekdays and would arrive to work roughly an hour later in Syracuse, NY. On her drive down route 365 that morning the roads were clear. The air temperature hovered in the low 30s and high 20s. Weather reported snowstorms were barreling in but wouldn't hit Oneida County until later in the day. While traveling at 50 mph in a 55mph speed zone, an inattentive driver pulled out in front of Kayla as if she wasn't even there. Kayla swerved, planted her foot on the brakes and immediately began to cry before suffering the inevitable impact.I took a 56 second phone call at 8:11am. Kayla's mother Christina delivered the news to me. I needed a minute to gather my thoughts and emotions before I got behind the wheel for a 45 mile drive to her. My boss, Donato, quickly relieved me of my work duties and reassured me that the Therapy Team would be okay. Therapy was around before I was even thought of yet so I needed to get over the fact that my work was incomplete as fast as possible, it would still be there when my family duties were satisfied. Boy.... I had no idea what was in store for me yet.The drive back to Rome was the longest ride I have ever experienced. They say, the average mind thinks up 2,000 thoughts per hour. I must have had 6,000 during that harrowing 45 minute drive. ""What if she broke her jaw? She'd have to get nourished through a tube! How long does it take for a jaw to heal? What about Molly? Is Molly dead? No fucking way, my daughter is made of steel! How would I ever continue to live if I have just lost the love of my life? She was grumpy as I kissed her and left in the darkness of 5am. Why did my punk ass leave without hugging her until she woke up like I usually do?"" I had to find a way to get my head on straight, so i sped up and drove like I was in an action movie.When I got to the hospital, I blasted through the ER doors, learned which room Kayla was admitted to and ran in there. She wasn't in the room. A nurse mentioned she would be back in 20 minutes as medical imaging was doing their work. I sprinted through Rome Memorial hospital and barked questions at the clerks. ""Kayla Snyder, where is she?"" It took 10 minutes to get an answer as they had to call the operator, be forwarded to another operator, placed on hold and told a staff member was coming to escort me. No one ever came. Christina saved my time yet again. She'd called me, gave me an idea of where she was and we found each other in less than 20 seconds. Keith Snyder pointed to door number 2 and I walked in ready to power bomb the next person who couldn't give me a straight and expeditious answer. Kayla and I locked eyes. She was on the stretcher getting an ultrasound done. I noticed the blood on her lip, makeup smeared all over her face and she was dead silent. Fear and relief were in her eyes. It took every bit of my manhood to keep myself together as I knelt down, gripped the back of her neck with both of my hands through her hair and held her head to mine.After a plethora of testing at Rome Memorial hospital, we discovered an ""abruption"" had occurred on the umbilical cord. A blood clot had formed between the attachment site of the cord and the placenta. Baby was slowly leaking blood back into Mom. Mom's body was attempting to return the blood to baby but it was a slow negative feedback loop. We were sent to Crouse via ambulance. I followed in my Equinox packed with 24hrs of clothing and comfort items, naively.Shortly after arriving at Crouse and locking Kayla's rolling bed into place in room 8006, a team of Operators appeared. They hinted at the possibility of emergency surgery and openly discussed potential action plans. It was a strategy they employed over time to decrease the cognitive dissonance that comes with the sudden discovery that surgery is going to happen in minutes.Kayla underwent a cesarean section with me be her side. It was the freakiest thing in the world. Her words. To me, my mind was focused on keeping order during the chaos so it didn't seem totally real. That was, until I saw Molly wrapped in plastic with a tube down her throat, manually forced to take breathes, under UV lighting and not crying at all. She was about the size of a plantain. At 13 inches long, she only weighed 1 pound and 13 ounces. Molly was love at first sight, she is beautiful. She's got her mother's hands and feet but shes got my long toes and big nose. Her eyes were sealed like a brand new puppy's at birth. And her skin was as smooth as an egg and more fragile than wet tissue paper.She was taken away immediately from us. Doctors pulled me out of the room so that they get give it to me straight without upsetting the girlfriend who was setting there with her womb open. ""Molly has injuries from the accident. She is bleeding internally in the abdomen. We will do everything necessary. But it does not look good. Prepare yourself."" I was in awe as i gazed at them through my tear filled glasses. I bit down and replied, ""Do what you need to do"" and returned to Kayla thinking about how I would tell her. She had been born 15 weeks early at just 25 weeks and 2 days of gestational age.We didn't hear about Molly nor get to see her for at least another 3 hours. But when we did, it was a huge relief. In the Neo-natal Intensive Care Unit, she lives in a translucent acryllic box fed with IV and respiration lines. The air temperature and humidity is controlled and a Nurse has been assigned to Molly alone because of her critical condition. They found a few things that work to keep her breathing, at a cost that is unknown to her development from minute to minute. Her condition changes rapidly and it is painstaking to watch.Kayla trusted me enough to push hard to recover. She let me guide her in building up some functional mobility tolerance. We started with frequent trips to the toilet after the catheter was removed. Then we took to the halls and walked further and further with each try. She's tough and I love her for it. Iron sharpens iron. She let me bathe her in the shower, to an extent of course. She accepted my help to get dressed. Her pride wasn't hurt. She knew she could trust me.At the time of my writing this up, we have been awake for over 36 hours. I tried my best to leave out the nuances. I am not someone who asks for help, I try to be as independent as possible. Solve my own problems. But for the first time in my life, I have little control and I need help from my community.I am returning to work 1/14/19. Monday. Kayla is potentially going to be discharged on that morning. We cannot afford to travel 90 miles round trip, daily to be with Molly. My goal is to book a room at the Ronald McDonald House in Syracuse. It is $25 dollars a night. I am striving to book nearly 4 months of tenancy in support of my girlfriend and daughter. Molly cannot leave the hospital until her age, weight and health meet certain criteria. Her original due date was April 26th. She continues to be in critical condition. We cannot allow Molly May Snyder-Blanc to spend 4 months alone, in an acryllic box without her mother. I need help maintaining a room at the Ronald McDonald House so that my girlfriend can maximize her time with Molly. Kayla is not returning to work for at LEAST 8 weeks. I am going to be working my tail off to ensure our two boys continue to live as normally as possible. That means having hot home cooked meals at the dinner table, doing homework and going to school. Of course we will visit but we cannot let these difficult times string our family apart from being able to function.Please join me in my efforts to support Molly May and Kayla. I don't know how else to say this but its not just a ""donation"". $25 means what Kayla, the boys and I have a 24hr window to be with Molly. The Ronald McDonald House hosts volunteers who cook for families experiencing medical emergencies that have to leave their home town for skilled services. The excess monies provided will be donated to the Ronald McDonald house to assist the next family who needs it. This is not for personal gain. Please, help us!Read more"

Austin was immediately rushed to hospital and doctors had to perform emergency neurosurgery to try and alleviate and fix his spine. He has been hospitalized since and will hopefully be moved to a long-term rehabilitation unit soon, to help further aid in his recovery. Austin faces a long battle of recovery with rehabilitation. Austin was working as a general contract laborer which means he does not qualify for workman’s comp benefits and he also does not have any medical insurance at the time. Austin and his family are asking for anyone who is able to help to do so through this fund. The funds raised will help to offset the medical costs as well as help the family complete renovations to their home to make Austin’s, eventual, return home a little easier and provide Austin with better mobility to, from and around his home.

I'm very sad to have to tell you that my dad died very early today, January 10, 2020, a little after midnight.He was diagnosed in November with a very aggressive form of lymphoma. Treatment initially went well, and we were very hopeful. But his health and strength began to decline sharply in mid-December, and a few days ago, the doctors told us they had made a decision to discontinue treatment, there was no hope, and they recommended hospice care. Pop chose not to tell anyone how ill he was, because he was so convinced he'd get better and soon be his old self again. He mostly slept during his final days, but when awake he was in good spirits. He passed away quietly in his sleep, without pain or further suffering.His connection to his friends, his readers, and his colleagues enriched his life, and he never stopped being delighted to meet people who read his work, who were interested in writing, who loved books and stories, and who shared his sense of wonder. He remained enthusiastic about his craft and devoted to his writing to the end of his life, and was always thrilled to be part of the science fiction community, as both a fan and a pro. He taught me a lot about being a writer and a professional.My dad met my mom nearly 60 years ago and has been devoted to her ever since. She said to me this morning that no one could have had a better husband. My mom will miss him more than anyone, but we know he will be missed by many people.He will be cremated, as per his wishes, in a private family service. We will plan a memorial/remembrance gathering for him later this year, at a location where we hope many of his friends can be present--maybe a convention.Meanwhile, his long illness leaves his widow, my mom, with many large medical bills, while grieving his loss, and without him being here to generate any more income. In his memory, if you would like to help her, his medical GoFundMe is still running.On my dad's behalf, thank you for all the good times, good laughs, and good memories he enjoyed in what was a happy and fulfilling life.

UPDATE on 12/11/2019: Mike is now battling cancer on top of his previous major surgery, for which this fundraiswer was created. The doctors are very optimistic and say he is responding to treatment incredibly well, but because of new surgery, radiation and chemo bills, he is in need of this fundraiser more than ever. As you can imagine, he is literally bleeding money at he moment. Every dollar helps. Thank you, again, for all the support you have given Mike! <3

ORIGINAL POST: This GoFundMe is for writer and editor Mike Resnick, who has won a number of top awards and is known for his ""pay it forward"" nature in the writing field, ushering more than two dozen embryonic writers into the industry.Mike unfortunately spent most of the first half of 2019 in the hospital. At the start of the year he fell twice for some (then) unknown reason, the second time being unable to get up. Carol, his wife, had to call 911 and it was determined that he had pneumonia and acute idiopathic pericarditis. In three days he had 30 pounds of fluid drained from around his heart and lungs. Then, a couple of months later, he collapsed again and within 24 hours the hospital had removed his colon (large intestine). Not many seventy-seven-year-olds recover from such serious medical complications, and he is very lucky to be alive and writing today.Although he is still confined to a wheelchair, Mike has just this month gone back to writing and editing, and his doctors are very pleased with his progress. But he did go more than half of this year without any income, and as you can imagine the hospital bills are many and prohibitively expensive, as well as half a year’s worth of living expenses. He also still needs regular rehabilitation sessions (luckily, from the comfort of his home), and, quite frankly, he needs the assistance of the community of writers and readers he has had the privilege to call his family for more than half a century.Mike and Carol Resnick would dearly thank anyone who is able to donate towards the medical/economic efforts in helping this Literary Great of the science fiction and fantasy community get back on his feet. Mike has many more books to write and stories to tell, but he can only do it with your help. Thanks again, in advance!

On the 26th of December Jake woke up in the morning with what he assumed was Gastro; he slept most of the day and woke up later that night having a fit and fainting twice. His condition then began to rapidly deteriorate. Jake became extremely confused and disorientated and by the time an ambulance arrived his lips were blue. In the 5-minute trip to the hospital he started to develop a deep purple rash and by the time he got to the emergency room his organs began to fail and he was immediately put on life support.Jake was diagnosed with Meningococcal (W Strain), Bacterial Meningitis and Septicaemia. His family were told he wouldn’t make it through the night. Remarkably, Jake did make it through the night however, at this stage he was in an induced coma, his liver and kidneys had failed, an artery in his heart was not pumping blood, his lungs had collapsed and his legs, arms, nose and ears were turning black from a lack of oxygen. His chance of survival was 5%.Jake kept fighting for his life and whilst still in a coma in Armadale Hospital he was transferred to Royal Perth Hospital. On the 5th of January Jake woke to his family for the first time since his nightmare began. Jakes condition slowly began improving day by day however he was still in a very critical condition. His kidneys and liver had been attacked by the infection and he remained in ICU. Jake continued to defy the odds stacked against him and his condition slowly improved.In February, Jake was transferred to Fiona Stanley Hospital where he would undergo the next step in his journey. Whilst the meningococcal virus was no longer in Jakes system the damage had been done. He began to undergo a series of long painful surgeries in which both his hands and legs were amputated 15cm below the knee. The surgeons would need to space out the operations and Jake required many skin grafts for his surgeries, lost all the skin on his legs and endured countless trips to dialysis to filter his blood. Thankfully Jake recently had his last operation and his road to recovery can finally start to begin. Jacob has shown an enormous amount of courage, determination and resilience. He has defied all odds and as a father to two beautiful girls he has showed them what true strength really is. Jakes new journey in life is just beginning and he has many struggles ahead of him. Jakes family are now facing the reality of having him home in the coming months and he will begin his rehabilitation phase. They will face significant expenses over the coming years and to help with his recovery, Jacob’s family will require a specialised vehicle in which he can drive his wheelchair onto. We will aalso need modifications made to Jacobs home there are many things that Jacob will need to make his new life as comfortable as possible Any donations will go a long way to help improve Jakes quality of life. Most importantly Jacob wants to spread awareness about this life threatening disease and urges everybody, no matter what age, to stay up to date with his or her vaccinations. A large percentage of Australians are not vaccinated against the new strains of Meningococcal and it is vital that you make an appointment with your GP and get the vaccinations as soon as possible.Read more"

Hi there,My name is Athena Martinez and I compete in MMA amateur fighting for the Australian Top Team.I had a fight scheduled for friday 27th of November.The day before the weigh-in I started with my water cut, sauna and baths.Dehydration helped me cut 4kg of water the night before the weigh in to qualify for my fight.Just before the weigh-in my new nutritionist told me to meet him at a “recovery” clinic for a cryotherapy session.I was left there for 6 minutes, 3 minutes more than the recommended safe time.

After the cryotherapy i could feel my legs burning.A few hours later blisters starts to pop out.

I rushed to the hospital to get it properly assessed and they drained the blisters and bandaged my legs.The next day I came back to the Burns Hospital and they rushed me into theatre for limb saving surgery. My doctor was concerned about my circulation and severe muscle damage and as I had lost all the sensation in my legs. There was a risk that I could lose both of my legs!

They removed all the dead skin and performed a synthetic skin graft and Thank God my muscles weren’t severely burned.My boss kindly paid for my surgery as I don’t have Medicare (I am not an Australian citizen) so I need to pay for all the expensive medical bills. I will require more bandage changes, medical appointments, medications, rehabilitation, transport to and from appointments, and legal fees which I cannot afford without financial assistance. It could be a long time until I can return to work.

I have wonderful friends but I don’t have any family who live in Australia to help meIf there is anyway that anyone could support me it would be greatly appreciated!I’m very blessed for still having my legs and very frustrated that this has happened to me in such an important moment in my life.But I’ll live to fight another day.Thank you in advance from all my heart.Any money donated to me that is left over after my bills are paid will be donated to a charity for burns patients or to the Rural Fire Service to help their volunteers.Love,Athena M.

Late Friday night, they were involved in an accident in Palm Springs that caused their car to flip and roll six times. Two of Jenee's beautiful children, Aaliyah (6) and Jeremiah (2) died at the scene.From a young age, Jenee Scott has always been dedicated to helping others. As a child she wanted to be a pediatric doctor, allowing her to blend her passion for others and her love for kids. When she got pregnant at 18, she continued to follow her dreams while supporting her child, and earned her Medical Assistant Certificate shortly after graduating high school. She became a caring, loving mother to four wonderful babies. Despite any hardship she faced, she always put her kids first, and lent a helping hand to anyone she could.Jenee and the surviving two children, Amari (age 8) and Ariah (age 2) are still in the hospital in critical condition. Jenee has suffered two fractured vertebrae, broken ribs, bruised lungs, and a bruised throat. Her recovery time will be lengthy.The pain of this tragedy has only been made worse by the on-going pandemic. The children have only been allowed one visitor, and Jenee has been completely alone trying to heal from her injuries and the pain of her loss. Her family waits in hospital parking lots, only able to get information about their status over the phone. Ariah is awaiting surgery today, and though she hasn't been able to open her eyes, when given a teddy bear she's been able to clutch and pat it.Aaliyah and Jeremiah were two of the purest souls to ever know this Earth. Aaliyah was quick-witted, fun-loving, and always ready to dance or sing. Jeremiah was the snuggliest, sweetest baby boy with an undying love for his twin sister, Ariah. They were taken from us far too soon and we will never forget their bright smiles or warm hugs.Jenee has dedicated her life to her children and to helping others in her profession and personal life. The mounting bills for medical expenses beyond insurance coverage, funeral cost, transportation and recovery are beyond what the extended family can pool together.If you are able to help in any way, even just a few dollars, it would mean the world to the Scott family as they fight to recover. Updates will be posted as they become available.I am organizing this campaign on Jenee's behalf and have assembled a team of helpers that includes her sister, grandparents, aunts and uncles. We do not yet have, and will not have for several weeks, a firm estimate of the family's full recovery needs. Funds will be used for Jenee, Amari, and Ariah's medical bills, rehabilitation, recovery living expenses, getting the survivors home, and other related bills. Other funds will go to transportation and interment of Aaliyah and Jeremiah. We have recovered Jenee's banking information and all proceeds will go directly to her. Please direct any questions or concerns to me as the organizer.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.Read more"

Carter was airlifted from the scene of the accident to an equipped trauma center hospital in upstate New York. What could have been a terrible tragedy turned out to be a miracle, as Carter is with us and fighting harder than ever to recover. A more experienced team of doctors was deemed necessary so after stabilizing him for a few days, Carter was once again medevaced to an ICU in a hospital closer to home. Carter incurred multiple injuries, serious and extensive in nature. The length of his hospitalization is currently unknown. Upon future release from regular hospital care, he will spend a significant amount of time in a rehabilitation facility in either NYC or Westchester County. Carter is the son of two longtime Seaford residents, Tim Skretch and Jaime Kern, who serve the public every day. Tim is a Captain with the NYPD and Jaime is a nurse at Nassau County Medical Center. Along with their large, extended family, they have given back to our community during times of illness and tragedy, time and time again. It is our turn to repay their kindness when needed the most.

No donation is too small and no donation is unappreciated. Please give within your means and share this fundraiser with everyone on your FB and email friend lists. The more people we reach, the more help Carter and his parents will receive. Please also keep Carter and his family in your thoughts and prayers.

It's an autoimmune disease which has attacked Jack's healthy blood vessels, causing them to become swollen and narrow. One of the disease's side-effects has meant that Jack has had several strokes caused by the lack of blood supply to parts of his brain.The good news is Jack is being given specialist care in one of London's top hospitals, where over the next six-months he will receive chemotherapy, which will be used to treat the disease.To aid his rehabilitation, we'd like to raise money to buy him some things that will help him recover from this disease and its awful side effects, improve his time spent in hospital, and help him when he eventually goes home.The immediate need is to buy Jack an iPad that he can use to listen to audiobooks and music and give him a way to speak to his friends using Facetime. We aim to get him subscriptions to both Audible, Spotify, as well as other apps that can aid his recovery and improve his time in hospital. Jack also requires a good pair of noise-cancelling headphones he can use whilst on the ward and will also need money to pay for the hospital's premium wi-fi. We'd also like to be able to get him some casual clothing he can wear while in hospital, as well some other creature comforts to help improve his stay. Jack will have different needs as time goes on, and any money left over will be used to get him back on his feet, especially when he finally gets home.We know that Jack has lots of friends, including his former colleagues in the music press and record industry, and all his friends he made in recovery over the last 25+ years, as well as members of the hi-fi groups he regularly contributes to. This page has been set up in response to all the goodwill we've received on Jack's behalf, so please donate whatever you can to help Jack.

It is with great sadness, that I am forced to start this GoFundme. I never, in a million years, thought I’d need to, but…here I am!!



As some may know, I am the younger brother of Troy Botteon Jr. Growing up, I had him as my protector & person to turn to, however, the past 3 years I have helplessly watched as mental illness took my once happy, joyful, loving brother and turned him into a prisoner within his own mind. I've been fighting like hell to get him back, but every attempt has been unsuccessful. Unfortunately, yesterday March 10, 2021, Troy had a medical emergency that sent him into cardiac arrest, not once, but twice which it took 22 minutes to get his heart beating again. If you’re not aware of what that means, it means the next few days, weeks or months are going to be the most difficult time for me and my family. Just the past 24hrs alone have been hell! Everything is “hit or miss"" will he survive?? They say it’s too early to tell! If he does survive, what will his life be like? It’s too early too tell! I hate that I need to turn to ask for any help, but I need to be honest with you all and myself, so here it is….



I need help, I’m barely making it as it is, and now this... Days, weeks or months at the hospital means I’m out of work. Parking, gas and food, well that’s hard. What about if and when he pulls through this, how will I help him with treatment or rehabilitation? Or, If he doesn’t make it, how am I to pay for final expenses. I may have jumped the gun with the original post, but I am in FULL PANIC mode, with a million and one emotions. Hence this lengthy, yet honest post. Please, if you can help with anything, I would truly appreciate it. I will try to keep everyone updated as much as I can. Please pray for Troy and be respectful of his privacy during this difficult time.



Love, Austin

On January 25th, 2019, she went into acute hypoxic respiratory failure from pneumonia caused by RSV. Her identical twin and her newborn baby brother also caught RSV, but because Logan’s lungs were compromised due to her premature birth and TEF, Logan was hit a lot harder.Logan and her identical twin Payton were born at 34 weeks and within hours of her birth, they discovered that Logan's stomach and lungs were not attached in the right place. So, the very next day, at only 2 lbs 13 oz she had surgery to repair her TEF. At the time, she was the smallest baby the surgeon had ever operated on. She spent a total of 77 days in the NICU, including another surgery that almost took her life, but she overcame all if this and was doing great, until RSV.On the 25th, Logan was admitted to Lutheran General Hospital. She was transported by ambulance on cpap but upon arrival needed to be intubated and put on a ventilator to help her breathe. A few days later, the ventilator was not enough support as the RSV was still running it’s course so she had to go to an oscillator. After about a week or so on the oscillator, once again it proved to not be enough support and they had to put her on ECMO.ECMO is a heart and lung bypass machine. Logan's lungs were so sick, they could not support her life. ECMO was her last chance to survive. For 10 days we waited. Waited to see what her body would do. After those 10 scary days, Logan came off ECMO and was put back on a ventilator. Over the last 3-4 weeks, Logan has had some ups and downs but she is finally coming home tomorrow, after 50 days in the PICU.Because Jacqui and Kyle needed to have someone at the hospital around the clock for Logan, as well as someone home to take care of Payton and their newborn, James, Kyle has not been able to work.While Jacqui and Kyle have medical insurance for Logan, they still have medical bills from the girls premature birth and ensuing medical difficulties surrounding that. Now they have an added 7 weeks of Pediatric Intensive Care bills, ECMO care bills, and continuing home support for Logan. Logan is recovering well, but will be coming home with a feeding tube, pulse oximeter, and nebulizer for around the clock feeding and breathing medicine needs. She will also have a multitude of therapeutic rehabilitation needs.During this time of recovery and healing, any and all financial help for Jacqui and Kyle is greatly appreciated. If you can donate, that is awesome. If not, we understand. Your thoughts and prayers have meant the world to us. If you’re able to share this post, we would greatly appreciate it.Read more"

Remington Reed is an amazing guy. He's a loving father of two daughters, a dedicated husband to an equally amazing wife, and one of the kindest friends you could ask for. He is hilarious, compassionate, and one of the brightest people I know.Thursday, December 10, in the yuckiest year in record, Rem was diagnosed with a brain tumor. We don't know a lot about it right now, except that it's pressing into his poor brain, causing delirium and seizures. The doctors are still looking into how operable it is.

Brain tumors aren't cool. They aren't pretty. They aren't even remotely awesome.But they are expensive.

So. Current needs are not super clear, but figuring in for co-payments for medical procedures, help with possible rehabilitation, and needs for the family during his recovery, we're hoping to raise at least $6,000.

We know.

2020 has been horrible for us all, and we understand that not many of us can boast a surfeit of discretionary funds. Knowing that, please know that the Reeds are worth your time. Anything you can do to help would be more than appreciated, and would be a Christmas miracle for an amazing family.

We love you, and thank you.

I’ve spent the last 5 years living in constant pain that started from Thoracic Outlet Syndrome(TOS) that turned into Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS).Both conditions are explained in great detail below. For now, here is a little about me:I had a very full life. I owned my own salon and was a very successful hairstylist. I was independent in all the ways that mattered to me. I was doing Vinyasa yoga and hiking 3-4 days a week. I was taking advantage of being an Auntie with nephews living close by-which was by far my favorite thing to do. I had just started dating the love of my life and was the happiest I’d ever been.On the last day of February 2016, I woke up with a migraine and a stiff neck. I had no idea how much my life was about to change. Literally overnight.My conditions cause extreme nerve pain that, at times, makes me feel like I am on fire. All of the muscles in my neck, chest, upper back and arms are constantly tense or having spasms. My arms are so weak, I can barely hold my phone. I have terrible brain fog and have difficulty remembering things. I also have migraines, nausea, vertigo, and constant fatigue. I feel like I am trapped inside a broken body that, at times, feels like a prison.I have tried every treatment possible and had three surgeries in an attempt to lower my pain. I have worked so hard to manage my pain every single day while trying to remain grateful and find my purpose.I want to be able to hug my boyfriend without pain. I want to hold his hand. I want to be able to play with my nieces and nephews. Being an Auntie is the best thing that’s ever happened to me. I need help so I can be the Auntie and woman I know I am inside: the woman I am meant to be.The Spero Clinic aims to restore balance to the central nervous system, which assists the body in healing within. They are currently the only center in the world that offers their unique neurologic rehabilitation program. They use multiple tools and techniques designed to enhance each other. In order to synergistically restore balance to the central nervous system, enabling the body to heal itself.Treatments consist of the following:Katman Vagus Nerve Therapy, Magnetic Resonance therapy, Neuromuscular reeducation, scar tissue therapy, micro-current neurosage, Ionic therapy, neruo-modulation, custom dietary changes, brain balancing, lymphatic therapy, oxygen therapy, and more.Patients usually stay an average of 12 weeks, but they recommend that you fundraise for 16 weeks, just in case. The cost is $3000 per week. The price includes all of the treatments that Dr. Katinka recommends to give your body the best chance possible to heal.Complex Regional Pain Syndrome(CRPS) is a chronic pain condition in which high levels of nerve impulses are sent to an affected site. Doctors believe that CRPS occurs as a result of disfunction in the central or peripheral nervous system.CRPS is considered to be the most extreme and painful condition known to man. The symptoms of CRPS vary in their severity and length. One symptom of CRPS is continuous, intense pain that gets worse rather than better over time. Other symptoms of CRPS include: burning sensations in the affected area, sensitivity to clothing or stimuli, uncomfortable tingling and burning, pins and needles, whole body nervous system disfunction or sweating, depression, headaches, redness, joint stiffness, swelling, tenderness, and brain fog.Thoracic outlet syndrome is a group of disorders that occur when blood vessels or nerves in the space between your collarbone and your first rib (called the “thoracic outlet”) are compressed. This can cause pain in your shoulders, neck, and numbness in your fingers, arms, and hand. I got TOS from the repetitive motion of being a hairstylist. I have tried acupuncture, massage, chiropractic care, physical therapy( with five different therapists) and injections. Ultimately, having to have major decompression surgery that involved removing scalene muscles from the neck and the first rib. Unfortunately, the surgeon did not do his job and left me in worse pain than I was in before. My doctors believe this is what caused my CRPS. Thankfully, I found Dr. Humphries at UC Davis who was able to help me lessen my pain with two more major surgeries over a period of two years; however, I still live with severe pain every day that cannot be managed with medications.The Spero clinic has an 83% success rate. I need to get to the Spero clinic because I deserve a chance at having my quality of life back. I deserve to live in less pain. I have tried every single treatment available and am at the end of the line with treatments when it comes to western medicine. My doctors do not know how to help me anymore. The Spero Clinic really is my last hope.Read more"

He is 8 years old and has Cerebral Palsy (Spastic Quadriplegia). Sergej lives in Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina with his 9 year old sister, his dad and mum. Sergej’s mum (my sister) wrote the below and asked me to post it on their behalf because ‘gofundme’ is not available in Bosnia. Sergej likes cartoons, cars, computers and robots, and more than anything he would like to be able to walk.When Sergej was born prematurely he had catastrophic intracranial bleeding which caused massive complications and his Cerebral Palsy. As a result, he has had extensive and costly therapies and medical treatments his whole life.Sergej commenced physical therapy when he was three months old and since then has had two intensive therapies every year. In 2017 Sergej had Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR) surgery at the Children's Hospital St. Louis. This surgery treated the spasticity in Sergej’s legs and he was able to make some small steps as a result. But to maintain this improvement he needs daily exercise and physical therapy. He also needs at least two to three intensive therapies a year, which involve two to four hours of therapy every day for four weeks at a time. Because he is a growing boy, he needs new orthoses every year and new equipment for exercises and movement such as his walker and wheelchair.As we live in Bosnia, we don’t have access to the type of therapies and equipment that are available in other countries. To receive these we need to be able to travel to access specialist physical rehabilitation centres for children.All these treatments and equipment are very costly and none of it is covered by medical insurance. Sergej's insurance covers only nine hours of physical therapy and nine hours of occupational therapy a year with only one government provider. This is no where near what Sergej actually needs.Sergej greatly benefits from regular and frequentphysical therapy and intensive physical therapy to work on his basic motor skills such as sitting and rolling. The physical therapy improves his trunk control, increases his muscle strength and helps with his communication.Sergej has the potential to achieve so much, and his therapies will give him the best chance at life and the best chance at possibility someday walking independently.We have managed to pay all medical expenses for the past six years. My husband works full time and I work part time as I am also Sergej and his sister’s full time carer. But the cost to maintain the treatments that Sergej needs is no longer within our capacity. We need help to make sure that Sergej continues to receive the therapies he needs to improve his quality of life.Annual cost of Sergej’s therapies:1. Intensive physical therapy (Sloveniaor other European country) transportation and accommodation- 3 times a year, for three weeks, 4 hours a day                                                          = 10,000 €2. Regular physical therapy and Aquatic therapy - 2 to 3 times a week, 1 hour a day              = 10,000 €3. DAFO - long orthoses for both legs (from Austria) - usually Once a year                        =  4,500 € 4. Robotics neuro-rehabilitation (Croatia, Austria, Poland or Switzerland) - Once a year         = 30,000 €5. Transportation, accommodation and leaving costs                                                =  4,000 €Total cost per year = 58.500 € + EquipmentRaising these funds will help Sergej improve his quality of life and his chances of possibly being able to walk and have to some degree of independent living one day.If you can, please help us give Sergej the best chance at life.German version:Das ist Sergej. Er ist 8 Jahre alt und hat Zerebralparese (spastische Quadriplegie). Sergej lebt mit seiner 9-jährigen Schwester, seinem Vater und seiner Mutter in Banja Luka, Bosnien und Herzegowina. Die Mutter von Sergej (meine Schwester) hat das Folgende geschrieben und mich gebeten, es in ihrem Namen zu posten, da ""GoFundMe"" in Bosnien nicht erhältlich ist. Sergej mag Cartoons, Autos, Computer und Roboter und vor allem möchte er laufen können. Als Sergej vorzeitig geboren wurde, hatte er katastrophale intrakranielle Blutungen, die massive Komplikationen und seine Zerebralparese verursachten. Infolgedessen hatte er sein ganzes Leben lang umfangreiche und kostspielige Therapien und medizinische Behandlungen.Sergej hat im Alter von drei Monaten mit der Physiotherapie begonnen und seitdem jedes Jahr zwei intensive Therapien erhalten. 2017 ließ sich Sergej im Kinderkrankenhaus St. Louis einer selektiven Dorsalen Rhizotomie (SDR) unterziehen. Diese Operation behandelte die Spastik (Spastizität)in Sergejs Beinen und er konnte dadurch einige kleine Schritte machen. Aber um diese Verbesserung aufrechtzuerhalten, braucht er tägliche Bewegung und Physiotherapie. Außerdem benötigt er mindestens zwei bis drei Intensivtherapien pro Jahr, die vier Wochen lang täglich zwei bis vier Stunden dauern. Da er ein aufstrebender Junge ist, benötigt er jedes Jahr neue Orthesen (Prothese)und neue Geräte für Übungen und Bewegungen wie Gehhilfe und Rollstuhl. Da wir in Bosnien leben, haben wir keinen Zugang zu den Therapien und Geräten, die in anderen Ländern erhältlich sind. Um diese zu erhalten, müssen wir reisen können, um Zugang zu speziellen Rehabilitationszentren für Kinder zu erhalten. Alle diese Behandlungen und Ausrüstungen sind sehr kostenintensiv und werden nicht durch eine Krankenversicherung abgedeckt. Sergejs Versicherung deckt nur neun Stunden Physiotherapie und neun Stunden Ergotherapie pro Jahr mit nur einem staatlichen Leistungserbringer ab. Dies ist nicht annähernd das, was Sergej tatsächlich braucht. Sergej profitiert in hohem Maße von einer regelmäßigen und häufigen Physiotherapie und einer intensiven Physiotherapie, um seine grundlegenden motorischen Fähigkeiten wie Sitzen und Rollen zu verbessern. Die physikalische Therapie verbessert seine Rumpfkontrolle, erhöht seine Muskelkraft und hilft bei seiner Kommunikation.  Sergej hat das Potenzial, so viel zu erreichen, und seine Therapien bieten ihm die besten Chancen im Leben und die besten Chancen, eines Tages unabhängig zu laufen.  Wir haben es geschafft, alle medizinischen Ausgaben für die letzten sechs Jahre zu bezahlen. Mein Mann arbeitet Vollzeit und ich arbeite Teilzeit, da ich auch Sergej und die Vollzeitbetreuerin seiner Schwester bin. Die Kosten für die Aufrechterhaltung der Behandlungen, die Sergej benötigt, liegen jedoch nicht mehr in unserer Kapazität. Wir brauchen Hilfe, um sicherzustellen, dass Sergej weiterhin die Therapien erhält, die er zur Verbesserung seiner Lebensqualität benötigt.Jährliche Kosten für Sergejs Therapien:1. Intensive Physikalische Therapie (In der Regel in Slowenienoder ein anderes europäisches Land) -drei mal im Jahr, dreiWochen, vier Stunden am Tag für zehn Tage =10,000 €2. Transport und Unterbringung nur für intensive physikalische Therapie (Slowenien oder ein anderes europäisches Land) -drei mal im Jahr =4,000€3. Reguläre physikalische Therapie -zwei bis drei mal die Woche, jeweils eine Stunde am Tag =10,000 €4. DAFO lange Orthesen für beide beine (In der Regel aus Österreich) -einmal im Jahr =4,500 €5. Neurorehabilitation in der Robotik (Kroatien, Österreich, Polen oder die Schweiz) -einmal im Jahr =30,000 €Gesamtkosten pro Jahr = 58.500 € + Ausrüstung. Das Sammeln dieser Mittel wird Sergej helfen, seine Lebensqualität und seine Chancen zu verbessern, möglicherweise eines Tages laufen zu können und ein gewisses Maß an Unabhängigkeit zu haben. Wenn Sie können, helfen Sie uns bitte, Sergej die beste Chance im Leben zu geben.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Read more"

Par contre il reste stable, faut voir le bon côté!Donc ceci veut dire qu’après ce premier traitement il devra attendre quelques jours et recommencer un 2e traitement de 5 jours!Il a passé un test électromyogramme, pour voir le fonctionnement de ses muscles et nerfs! Présentement, en dehors de ses jambes/pieds ainsi que ses bras/mains, son visage est très atteint au niveau des nerfs. Il a dela difficulté à articuler, mâcher et même fermer ses yeux.Alors en résumé, il en a encore pour quelques temps à l’hôpital (doit retrouver toutes ses sensations et mouvements avant de quitter) pour ensuite devoir aller dans un centre de réhabilitation plusieurs semaines!

Je vous redonnes des nouvelles aussitôt qu’il y aura du développement!

Merci encore 

———————————————————Update February 18 (6th day hospitalization):Hello!! Firstly a huge thank you on behalf of Pat for all your kind words and amazing donations !! Pat is literally moved to see all the support he has !! He will be eternally grateful to you, be certain!Regarding his condition, today he will be on his 5th day of hemoglobin treatment, unfortunately he has not improved his condition! On the other hand it remains stable, must see the bright side!So this means that after this first treatment he will have to wait a few days and start a second treatment of 5 days!He had an electromyogram test, to see how his muscles and nerves were working! Currently, apart from his legs / feet as well as his arms / hands, his face is badly damaged with the nerves. He has difficulty articulating, chewing, and even closing his eyes.So in short, he still has some time in the hospital (must regain all his sensations and movements before leaving) and then have to go to a rehabilitation center for several weeks!I'll get back to you as soon as there is development!thanks again—————————————————————Bonjour!!!

Je me nommes Mélissa! Je suis la grande sœur à Pat TremblayMon petit frère est un homme actifs (skateboard,snowboard,velo). Sa vie tourne autour de tout ça en dehors de son travail!! Il est seul et sans enfant! Mais travaille beaucoup! Il vient à peine d’avoir un nouveau poste en Technique Mecanique pour la ville de Montréal! N’a pas encore terminé son 3 mois de probation (il était pour KenWorth avant cela)! Il avait atteint son but, d’être dans son domaines pour le reste de ses jours!

Mais voilà que Mercredi le 10 Février il commence à engourdir des pieds. Le lendemain encore plus engourdi dans les jambes et les mains/bras s’en mêlent! Il n’entre pas travailler car il ne sent plus rien!Vendredi, presque impossible de marcher...il paralyse tranquillement! Prend rdv avec son médecin pour samedi matin! Finalemente son coloc l’emmènera à l’urgence de L’hôpital de Lasalle, car il est incapable de conduire, maintenant aussi paralysé la moitié du visage. Qui eux ont fait quelques tests mais constate que les problèmes sont neurologique, probablement le SGD, Syndrome de Guyllain Barré!

Ils le transfert donc à l’institut neurologique de Montréal!Ils lui ont fait une ponction lombaire car c’est le seul moyen pour obtenir un diagnostic fiable.Voila donc qu’aujourd’hui le diagnostic est sorti! Il a bien le SGD! Il est toujours autant paralysé! Ne peux se lever seul, même pour aller au toilette! Bref il ne peut plus être autonome pour le moment!

Il lui reste des tests à passer, vérifier l’état de son système nerveux!Les médecins estime(si tout va bien) qu’il pourrait sortie d’ici 7-10 jours s’il repondbien au traitement(soluté pour remplacer son hémoglobine histoire d’aider pour attaquer le virus) car avant de pouvoir sortir, il doit retrouver ses sensations et ses mouvements!

Mais que par la suite,on parle de plusieurs semaines en centre de réhabilitation!!!

Donc mon but, c’est de l’aider! Car n’ayant pas terminé sa probation à son nouveautravail, il devra faire une demande de chômage maladie. On sait tous qu’il y a 1 semaines de carances et que le salaire tombe a 55%. Mais il a toujours des factures à payer qui sont loins d’être couverte avec le chômage!Alors de cette façon, j’espère l’aider à se concentrer sur sa remise sur pied en allégeant son fardeaux monétaire!!

Que ce soit 5-10$ ca pourrais faire une belle différence pour lui!!!

Il ne savait pas que je lui partirais un GofoundMe...c’est mon initiative! Le connaissant il sera réticent! Mais je sais que monfrère est super bien entouré, par beaucoup de gens qui l’aime bien!! Alors voilà!je donnerai des nouvelles sur les développements à venir.Mille mercis à tout ceux et celles qui participeront!!!——————————————————Hello!My name is Melissa! I'm Pat Tremblay's older sisterMy little brother is an active man (skateboard, snowboard, velo). His life revolves around all this outside his work! He is alone and without children! But works a lot! He just got a new position in Mechanical Engineering for the city of Montreal! Has not completed his 3 months probation (he was for KenWorth before that)! He had achieved his goal of being in his field of work for the rest of his life! But now on Wednesday, February 10, his feet start to numb. The next day even more numbness in the legs and hands/arms are involved! He doesn’t go to work because he doesn’t feel anything anymore!Friday, almost impossible to walk...it is paralyzing him on a very quick time lapse! He thought of seeing a doctor on Saturday morning. Finally, his roommate decides to take him to the emergency room of the Lasalle hospital, because he is unable to drive. Now half his face is also paralyzed.They have done some tests but find that the problems are neurological, probably SGD, Guyllain Barré syndrome! They then decided to transfer him to the Montreal Neurological Institute!They gave him a lumbar puncture because it was the only way to get a reliable diagnosis.So today the diagnosis is out! He has the SGD! He is still so paralyzed. Can't get up alone, can't even to go to the bathroom! Right now he has lost all autonomy!He has to pass tests, check the state of his nervous system!Doctors believe (if all goes well) that he could be out within 7-10 days if he responds well to the treatment (solute to replace his hemoglobin to help attack the virus) because before he can get out, he must regain his sensations and movements!But then we are talking about several weeks in a rehabilitation center! So my goal is to help him! For not having completed his probation at his new job.He will have to apply for unemployment. We all know that there is minimum 1 week waiting periods and that the salary falls to 55%. But he still has bills to pay that are far from covered with unemployment!This way, I hope to help him focus on getting back on his feet by reducing his monetary burden! Just a simple $5-10 could make a great difference for him!He didn't know I'd leave him a GofoundMe...that is my initiative! But I know that my brother is very well surrounded, by many people who love him! So here we go!I will provide updates on further developments. Many thanks to all those who will participate!

Her 20 year old son Jake was in an accident. Over the next few hours as the doctors worked on Jake and discovered just how bad his injuries were it became more and more apparent that his recovery will be very intense and a long road. He has SEVERE burns to both his feet, legs and buttocks. Multiple fractures to his face. Neck fracture. A severely broken left shoulder and left arm. He has an injury to his carotid artery that puts him at risk for a stroke. A laceration to his liver. A collapsed lung. And a couple busted teeth. Unfortunately there is still a possibility that he will lose his left foot . He's had a fewsurgeries at this point and is expected to have more surgery every couple of days for the next couple of weeks. He's currently looking at a minimum of a 6 week stay in the hospital with extreme rehabilitation after that.His parents are staying by his side as much as possible. His father David lives in another state and flew in as soon as he got the call. He has plans to stay at the hospital by Jake's side until he's released. Thankfully the hospital has a ""family room"" for them to use but it's still basically a hospital room with an uncomfortable bed.Trish also has other children to care for so she's doing her very best to split her time up between a preteen and 1 year old triplets at home and the hospital.Due to an overwhelming amount of people asking how they can help Jake and his family financially we finally decided to create a fundraiser. Jakes parents were very hesitant in the beginning simply because they were unsure if auto insurance would cover all of Jakes medical expenses. We have since found out that due to him being 20 years old he is eligible for Medicaid, which is GREAT news. So this fundraiser will be used for anything not covered by Medicaid as well as the ridiculous amounts of recovery Jake is going to have to do. He will be unable to work for at least a year. He’s going to have a ton of doctor and therapy appointments. With the possibility of losing his left leg (we’ll keep everyone updated on this) he’s going to have even more to overcome. Please remember, this is being created because there has been an overwhelming amount of people requesting to help financially. If things change for some reason and Jake has no need for the money (in the event auto or medical insurance pays for additional financial support) the donations will be reversed. If there is more money than Jake needs to sustain a “normal” life, we will pay the money forward to someone else or a charity that is in need.Donations will be withdrew and handled by Jacobs step dad, Arthur Smith. They will be put into an account and dispersed as Jacob needs. Until Jacob wakes up his parents (Mom, Dad, and step dad) will continue to handle any of his financial responsibilities.Read more"

Her treatments culminated in an extremely complicated surgery which itself has resulted in severe life threatening scoliosis (bending of the spine). This can only be halted with a further major surgery and custom back braces. Unable to access a minimally invasive surgery in Canada, she is reaching out to cover the cost of this specialised surgery at a clinic in Germany, to purchase custom back braces she requires to maintain mobility, and to fund lifelong ongoing physical therapy costs. The cost of surgery, travel and accommodation are estimated at $60,000 and the back braces are $14,000 - future costs for her rehabilitation are unknown. The surgery could happen as soon as December 2019 and would ensure Marlene’s continued mobility by ensuring her body does not collapse to the point where her heart and lungs are unable to function.Who is Marlene Thimer?(Marlene Hiking 11 months post surgery)Marlene has always been a healthy, physically, mentally strong person. Cycling across Canada at the age of 21 is a good indication of her drive. After twenty years of working as a Professional Forester and, hiking, skiing and canoeing in Northwest British Columbia she started a family with her husband Paul and turned an organic farming hobby into a Certified Organic Farm in 2008. Marlene stayed at home to run the farm and home school two boys Aidan (18) and Conor (15) while Paul worked on the farm and in the forest industry. They now make a living farming on their property East of Smithers, BC in the beautiful Bulkley Valley.(Marlene with her pigs in 2016)Marlene is tough and as hard working and determined as they come. She is the driving force behind Happy Pig Organic Farm. She has also been very involved in her community; volunteering as a coach with community soccer, cross country ski club and on the volunteer board of the Bulkley Valley Farmers Market. (Marlene on a canoe trip in 2007)(2007 Canoe trip)(Hike with family friends hiking in 2006)(Marlene with her friends Linda and Jen skiing in 2017, still active as ever)Why does Marlene need your help?Throughout Marlene’s medical ordeal the family has rallied to grow the business to manage the medical costs and travel to and from Vancouver for treatment. Marlene is a very private and independent woman who has done everything in her ability to stay strong, keep moving and not be too much of a burden on the healthcare system. They constantly develop new products and ways to get their organically grown meats to market. However, the family-run Northern farm simply cannot generate the funds needed for this next stage of Marlene’s journey.(The Happy Pig farm-to-table food truck at the Kispiox Valley Music Festival in 2018)Please help. If you are touched by Marlene’s story, please share it with others and if it is within your means to make a donation towards the cost of the surgery or braces, Marlene, her family and friends would be forever grateful.If you would like a more detailed description of Marlene’s journey, her personal account is directly below. Her son Conor and several friends have also written short descriptions of their relationship with Marlene and these follow. There are also some pictures of Marlene, her family and friends both pre and post surgery.  Please be aware that some of the post surgery images at the bottom of the page are potentially disturbing to view.The details of what happened to Marlene:In 2016 she discovered a small lump next to her spine, about the size of a jelly bean. After several visits to healthcare professionals and numerous tests, the lump was diagnosed as cancer, specifically indifferential sarcoma in her spinea rectus muscle (a muscle deep in her back). She was told that this variety of cancer, responds well to intensive radiotherapy followed by immediate surgical removal of the tumour. Before her radiotherapy began Marlene and Paul researched as much as possible about this cancer and how to help her body fight this intruder with meditation, cannabis oils, exercise, specific foods, oils, extracts, etc. After her six weeks of radiotherapy it took three months to have the surgery. ,Twice Marlene flew to Vancouver for her scheduled surgery and was sent home until more specialist surgeons were available. When the surgery finally happened one of the doctors commented that the radiotherapy was almost pointless given the delay between its conclusion and the surgery – basically giving the tumour time to possibly recover.Marlene’s surgery was described as major (there were five highly specialised surgeons involved), but that she would be able to recover from fully in six months to a year. She was told that there would be some extra tissue taken around the tumour to ensure clean ‘margins’ and that there was a possibility that a small portion of one or two ribs near the tumour would be removed.After the nearly thirteen hour surgery, she spent the next two weeks in the hospital in Vancouver, followed by another four weeks living with friends to ensure availability for follow up appointments.She survived, but what had taken place in the surgery that was planned weeks in advance utilising countless scans, x rays, and tests turned out to be far more dramatic than what was explained to her by any of her doctors.The surgery involved the removal of large sections of four ribs, several muscles, nerves that control her abdominal muscles, a very large section of outer skin, part of her diaphragm, and some bone projections on her spinal vertebrae. Imagine a chunk approximately the size of two one pound blocks of butter side by side being taken from your body.The plastic surgeon was left to move several muscles from their original purposes and locations in an attempt to replace those removed. There was also a large section of surgical mesh installed to cover the opening exposed by her ribs which has now overgrown with scar tissue causing constant tightness and discomfort.The end result was that she now has no natural muscular support for her spine, and gravity is quickly pulling her helpless body downwards, eventually pressuring her lungs, heart and diaphragm which without treatment (meaning more surgery) could take her life. Surgically induced scoliosis, not an outcome she was expecting or one that was even floated as a possibility prior to surgery.After being discharged from hospital, there was no advice provided concerning any physical or mental therapy that she should seek, and other than one visit sixteen months later, there was no future communication with any of the doctors. The 16 month visit was set up after Marlene pleaded with them to see her as her body was changing in disturbing ways.Two years on, countless hours of self directed and personally financed intensive physical therapy, massage, chiropractic sessions, and working her muscles at the gym, she discovers that all of it may have been in vain.She is told by other specialist doctors and physiotherapists that her scoliosis was an unavoidable outcome of her surgery, and that she should have been referred to specialists in scoliosis before leaving the hospital post surgery; and that she should have been referred for specialised physical therapy and had custom back braces fitted immediately to help slow the progression of the scoliosis.To date all costs for travel to medical appointments, physical therapy, accommodation, chiropractor and massage therapy visits have been paid by Marlene. It could be that this money may have been better spent on braces and other types of specialised physical therapy. Following surgery Marlene was led to believe that if she worked hard her mobility and strength would return, now she knows this will require a lot more than hard work.In regards to cancer surgery, the surgeons’ only goal is to remove the cancerous tissue and have the patient survive the surgery itself. Quality of life, and future medical challenges arising because of the surgery are not the surgeon’s primary concern. In Marlene’s case, the certainty that the surgery may cause problems in the future, that could end, or substantially affect her life after surgery were not explained. Her decision to have the surgery at all was based on what she was being told about her full recovery afterwards.At this point Marlene’s spine is rapidly twisting downwards in a cork screw fashion. This creates pressure on her organs which causes pain, heart burn after eating, and difficulty breathing and sleeping.To address the scoliosis her doctors in Vancouver recommend another surgery during which they will collapse her lungs, move her heart (which they have to stop temporarily) and install a metal rod with screws attached to her spine which will allow her vertebra to fuse stopping the progression of her scoliosis. This surgery has never been performed on anyone like her, and doctors are not sure if one rod will actually do the job at all – it is highly probable the rod will break, the risk is very high and Marlene has decided she will not have this type of surgery.Through their own research Marlene and Paul have found a specialised surgeon in Germany, one of only a handful in the world who practice a much less intrusive surgery to stop scoliosis. She is scheduled to see this specialist in Germany at a clinic in August 2019. This surgery will be done utilising small entry holes rather than an open chest type surgery, and recovery is usually a matter of weeks rather than months. The risks are much less and the surgery has been successful for patients with symptoms similar to Marlene’s. This surgery will take place four to five months after the initial consultation.Conor Murphy, son of MarleneWhen I learned that the cancerous tumour in my Mom's back could be surgically removed, I was thrilled. After months of seeing her so infrequently due to treatment, and a constant threat of uncertainty that comes with cancer, this seemed like the dream come true, fix all solution. It was far from that. We all quickly learned how extreme her surgery was, and it soon became clear that the cancer was the easiest part of her journey. It’s not easy watching someone you love so much put so much time and energy into physical therapy, only to feel as if it is for nothing, because after all, her spine is continuing to bend. I want my Mom to at least have a chance at living a life similar to the one she lived before, and this surgery seems like the closest chance she has to that. (Marlene and Conor hiking in the fall of 2018)(Marlene and her boys during her son Aidans graduation)Sue Storoschuk, cousinMarlene Thimer. Who is she? Mother of two, wife, friend, daughter, cousin, farmer, nurturer of many things. Most of all, a stubborn, strong woman who took her cancer diagnosis and battled for her life. And she beat the cancer, killed it both with conventional medicine and alternative pathways with a passion and dedication few could do. Marlene took her strong work ethic and changed her life focus from her farm, community and family and shifted it to a focus of self-care and self-sacrifice. Marlene reshaped her life in order to kill her cancer. Isolating herself from the stress of a growing family, of running a successful organic animal farm and the commitments of community service. Marlene spent six months strengthening her body’s own immune system to fight the cancer cells that wanted to destroy her body. A dedication and strength that I admire and do not know that I have within me. Marlene trusted in the medical system, had her cancer taken out, but then the medical system simply left her on her own with little after care or thought from healthcare and no financial support. Marlene and her husband have tirelessly researched and sought out spine specialists and chiropractors who work with severe scoliosis, in desperation, to stop the stress on Marlene’s spine. If left unchecked, Marlene will simply collapse into herself, leaving her unable to work and enjoy simple tasks such as walking, things we take for granted.Marlene is unable to work, has down-scaled her farm and has had to accept the kindness and support of her family and friends. Living in a small community and having to fly to Vancouver to meet with specialists is a costly endeavour. And then there is the cost of the custom braces she will need to support her spine.(Marlene (right) and her cousin Sue in 2017 in Vancouver just before surgery)Marlene has always been the person who supported and gave to others. The act of receiving is a humbling experience for Marlene but one that she has accepted with grace and gratitude. Marlene is my cousin. I’ve cycled across Canada, hiked in the remote northern mountains of BC and watched her deal with the collapse of the BC forestry industry and change from forester to farmer. All big feats in themselves, but this cancer thing has been the biggest challenge of all. A challenge Marlene has faced full on. Please support this amazing woman continue her life’s journey.Helen Samson, friendMarlene and I have been friends for over 25 years, having met at university, and I considered her to be one of the best people I know. There simply aren’t sufficient words to describe what she and her friendship mean to me. While we have lived very different lives, at opposite ends of the province, Marlene has been a true and constant friend. She is so genuinely kind, caring, and supportive that she inspires me to be a better person. I am so proud to call Marlene my friend and am thankful that I have been able to support Marlene, even in a small way, on this journey she is facing. I would do anything for her. I can think of no one more deserving of our help. Her strength and determination are truly inspirational.(Marlene and Helen at Vancouver General Hospital post surgery)Sharon Storoschuk, cousinMarlene Thimer is my cousin. Growing up I didn’t spend much time with her because she was more my sisters age. They were great friends all through life. In fact, I was lucky if I saw her every 5 years or so. But then tragedy struck Marlene in the name of cancer and I was fortunate to be living in Vancouver where she came for treatment. I say fortunate, because getting to know Marlene has been such a gift in my life.This is a woman who wears her heart on her sleeve. When she talks about her two sons you feel the love, when she shows you pictures of her pigs (she’s an organic pig farmer) you feel the pride, when she talks about cooking and baking for her food truck you feel her love for her community. It’s always about the joy she has living and working on her farm in Smithers, about being a mother, about the people she serves and helps, and her love of the outdoors and being physically active. The cancer was aggressive and a large tumour on her back near her spine. The treatment meant she had to be away from her family for about 6 weeks to get radiation in Prince George, a 4-hour drive away. Then there were so many trips to Vancouver, requiring a flight and accommodations. She spent almost an entire summer in Vancouver before and after the surgery. And nothing prepared her for the aftermath of losing so much of her body to the surgery.(Photo taken by Sharon during another checkup in Vancouver post surgery)The cancer and recovery meant that she had to give up farming, volunteering, cooking, biking, hiking, skiing, and taking care of her family the way she wants to. She now has to commit every day to physiotherapy and resting, even though it’s been 2 years since the surgery. Her spine has now curved 45 degrees and continues. She has to balance herself with one arm just to walk. And now she embarks on a journey to correct and prevent more spine curvature. She is a fighter and a lover, she wants to live a full life, and she needs help. There is no government assistance to help pay for the physio, the trips to Vancouver, the expensive body braces, and health care that she desperately needs. This is a woman worth helping. She is a testament on mind over matter, on how we can heal our bodies, how to overcome cancer, and how to love life! Please join me in supporting Marlene and her family!Paul Murphy, husbandThe first time I met Marlene I knew we were meant for each other. Our mutual love of the outdoors and of pushing ourselves physically kept us active, healthy and happy. When she was diagnosed with cancer we all feared losing her. But she fought back and persevered, beating her cancer using every tool available. The surgery following her radiation treatment was to be the end of this tumultuous chapter in her life, and the opportunity for Marlene to get back to living without fear of cancer. But while the surgery extracted what remained of her tumour, it also brought about new life threatening problems creating a need for another major surgery.(Marlene and Paul barely awake after a week long canoe trip)We simply just cannot do this on our own, and she just cannot wait to have this procedure. Seeing someone you love go from healthy and strong to having difficulty walking and breathing is earth shattering. Please help to preserve what remains of Marlene’s mobility so she can continue to enjoy her life, her family, her friends, and her future.(The whole family during Christmas 2018)  GRAPHIC IMAGERY(Marlene's back post radiotherapy)(Marlene's back post surgery)(Marlene's back a few months after surgery)(Marlene's back February 2019)(Marlene's back in April 2019)Read more"

He was given 24-48 hours to live back in May and since then he has defied all odds that have been put against him and is focused on one goal, getting out of that hospital bed and going home for Christmas with his family.There is no better example of love than his Mum and Dad. They have been visiting him every morning and afternoon since the day he was admitted which is taking a huge toll on them. In non-Covid times he would have a queue of people around the block waiting to visit him. People would have been able to drop in to keep him and his parent's company, but obviously we are super limited in what we can do to support and it is just the three of them every day even though they know that we are all here.So many people have been asking over the last few months if there is anything they can do to help. Unfortunately, cases of prosecco are off the cards for a while but his medical team have indicated that they would like to have him home before Christmas and in order for this to happen his parent's will need to make significant renovations to their house. As well as the redesign to support his mobility, he will have a long road of rehabilitation ahead of him.With this in mind, we have set up a page where we would like to arrange a monetary gift for him and his parents. As you all know how proud James and his family are, this was a private page for direct friends and family only. Due to the incredible response of his friends and family this has now been shared publicly and to see the response from people touched by James story is truly humbling.He is having a tough few weeks so keeping his morale and determination up is the no.1 focus especially at the moment.

Sterling successfully smuggled a kidney for around 25 weeks without anyone noticing, until her smaller pelvic kidney was discovered on x-ray by pure coincidence at a few weeks old. Thankfully, it is behaving and with time, should act like a normal kidney, but not as effecient.- she was diagnosed with a tethered spinal cord, a condition where the spinal cord is pulled down and stuck, or fixed, to the spinal canal. It is nothing that needs to be addressed until about 12 months old, where Sterling may require a procedure to free her spinal cord and allow her spine to grow properly, allowing her body to grow big and strong.- she diagnosed with hip dysplasia. Sterling now sports a lovely hip brace for 23 hours a day, which she will wear for around a year, or until her hips strengthen. Making lemonade from lemons, the brace makes it easier for mommy and daddy to hold her, but adds an additional layer of difficulty to diaper changes.On top of everything above (as mentioned earlier, she is a special little girl) Sterling has a few other battles on her hands, but nothing this strong little girl can’t overcome. Her parents are constantly amazed at both her strength and sass, and can’t wait to go home as a family. They look forward to bath times, lazy days on the sofa, and relaxing at the beach at their home in Gary, Indiana, where they live with their fur babies Gustavo, Jerry, and Milo, who are all eagerly awaiting their new siblings arrival home.Sterling's Opa (German for Grandpa) set up the original GoFundMe in £/GBP (the currency of the UK) to help with Sterling's medical expenses in the USA, raising over £5,000 (roughly around $6,500 US Dollars) for Sterling's care. As Sterling lives in the US, the campaign was migrated over from the GBP campaign, to this USD campaign as this is more appropriate for her. To all donors who donated in GBP - we have not forgotten about you! Although your donation may not appear here as a donation, it will appear in the updates - from the bottom of our hearts, thank you!Sterling's has a long road a head of her, her medical condition requires highly specialised care around the clock. Thankfully, she has a an entire team of world-class nurses, doctors, and surgeons taking the best care of her. She will likely spend her first few months in the PCICU, until she's stable enough to come home. Your donation, and any other donations received will go towards Sterling's care, medical bills, and rehabilitation.There aren't enough words to express our gratitude - thank you from the bottom of our hearts for all the love, support, and donations. Sterling has shown us that she is a fighter, and she continues to surprise us all the time with the amazing strength she has to overcome her odds.Read more"

The family was fortunate that the coaches and wrestling parents immediately recognized the seriousness of Myle’s injury and quickly secured him, preventing further damage and possibly saving his life.Myles is paralyzed from chest to toes; he has use of his arms but not his hands. He struggles to keep the fevers down and is determined to gain as much mobility as possible. He was air Medevac’d to Santa Clara Valley Medical Center and is now a hard working patient in the Spine Rehabilitation Center, after which he will reside in Pleasanton.Myles’ family is devastated that their 15-year-old bright, smiling and happy boy is going through this traumatic injury.However, their son and brother is steadfastly determined in his recovery, and we are hopeful that our devoted and compassionate friend, accomplished student, wrestler, and violinist, will regain the use of his fingers and legs. And just like any other 9th grader, we all want Myles to realize his dreams of going to college and having a family of his own. To accomplish these goals, Myles will have a long journey of recovery ahead of him, during which many expenses will be incurred. We want Myles’ family to be able to give him all of the support he needs, without worry. To help with the additional bills, including caregivers, therapists, and travel, we have started this GoFundMe page.

He has always been a very active and independent boy – working on a trout farm, coaching gymnastics at the local YMCA, involved in scouts and a diligent student at Newhaven College.Hayden is also a dedicated and passionate gymnast. He travels 1.5 hours from Phillip Island to MYC Gymnastics Club in Mornington in order to meet his training requirements. This year in July, Hayden won the gold medal on the horizontal bar at the Victorian Championships.On Saturday 10th September, Hayden was involved in a horrific accident at his home. While training gymnastics skills on his trampoline, Hayden lost control and landed awkwardly on his neck. He fractured 4 bones in his neck, which caused damage to his spinal cord, and he was immediately airlifted to the Alfred Hospital for a 7-hour surgery. Hayden is currently paralysed from the chest down. He also has no function in his fingers. Hayden is undergoing an intensive spinal rehabilitation program. While we are still not certain of the degree of damage caused to the spinal cord, we know that Hayden is in for a long road to recovery. Spinal care and rehabilitation is an extremely expensive process. We are aiming to raise funds to assist Hayden and his family with the recovery process and the medical expenses.We are still believing that Hayden can regain more function in his body, but we are not certain. If Hayden is told that he will be permanently paralysed, we will look at increasing the target goal to $250,000 to assist with the endless unexpected expenses (wheelchair, renovations to house for disabled access, car modifications, constant check ups, the list goes on). Spinal trauma is one of the most expensive conditions in the medical field.It has been fantastic to see the overwhelming support from each of the communities that Hayden is involved with (family, gymnastics, scouts, school). So many of you have asked how you are able to assist. Donating to Hayden’s recovery will be a small gesture that will make a huge impact on Hayden and his family.

On the night of July 4th Meredith had an accident in a swimming pool resulting in a fractured C5 vertebra and an incomplete spinal cord injury. She was immediately rushed to the hospital where she received emergency surgery to decompress her spine and replace the broken vertebrae in her neck. Following surgery, Meredith spent a few weeks in ICU where she received constant care and attention monitoring her very early stages of recovery. We're thrilled to share with you that shortly after her time in ICU she was able to be transferred to Craig Hospital, an amazing rehab facility located in Denver, CO. This rehabilitation center specializes in Meredith's specific injury type and we truly feel is the best place for her to get the neurological recovery, distinctive care, and physical therapy that she will require. Now we can all agree that our dear Meredith has one of the strongest spirits we know, which is absolutely crucial to her recovery, however the path will not be an easy one physically, emotionally and financially. Due to the severity of her injury, she now has limited mobility on the upper half of her body and currently no functionality of her lower half. In an effort to ensure she can continue to receive the best treatment available we have opened a special needs trust. While we are still at the early stages in her path to rehabilitation, gauging from the costs of her treatment thus far and what's predicted for the future... financially burdensome would be an understatement. These funds will go directly to the variety of treatment services she will receive including any necessary specialty equipment, potential in-home services, and ongoing physical therapy. The contributions raised from the GoFundMe will go directly to that trust. Please note, we also have a Venmo account linked to the trust as a contribution resource, as well.Venmo: @mberkowitz-trustThank you so much for your love and support for Meredith. We all love her very much and ask you to continue to please keep her in your thoughts and prayers to give her the strength she will need to get through this. Your financial support will play a key role on her path to recovery and we cannot thank you enough.Read more"

We are a 501(c)3 approved non-profit dedicated to the spaying and neutering of feral cats and kittens, in order to reduce the problem of homeless feline overpopulation and euthanization. My husband and I are enthusiastic cat advocates and rescuers devoted to the humane capture, complete rehabilitation, relocation/release of adults who can not be tamed as pets as well as placing friendly adult ferals and bottle-fed kittens into no-kill shelters where they can find loving ""forever"" homes.Our charity fills a unique and necessary niche in our community as a viable alternative to already overcrowded shelters and similar programs have been proven to reduce feral cat colony sizes, saving the taxpayer thousands in animal control and euthanization costs. We are in desperate need of funding. We have tried various avenues such as our Facebook page www.facebook.com/erietrapandrelease as well as a webpage located at www.erietrapandrelease.com in addition to donation canisters at various local businesses which yields nothing but pocket change, calling local vendors for scratch and dent cans and damaged bags of food and knocking on doors for monetary support.Everything has failed. The donations are not forthcoming, but we continue in our mission to aid ferals at our own expense because this issue is our dream; this issue is our passion: we would like to do even more for these helpless and unwanted animals...With sufficient funding, it is my goal to purchase several acres of fenced in property with an outbuilding which will provide shelter and sanctuary for the animals as well as a safe environment for them to be released into after they have healed from their operations. They will be cared for by me personally, as well as prescreened volunteers who have no criminal history of animal abuse. In addition, I would like to go on speaking tours to increase public awareness of this critical under-reported issue at schools and clubs as well as appear on television and in the newspaper to further educate the community. There are so many things that I would like to accomplish in the future such as a Feral Cat Walk on October 16th each year to honor National Feral Cat Day, but it takes money to raise money. Please reference my Wishlist for further details.I can not tell you how much your support means to us and especially to the many cats and kittens who are needlessly suffering and dying due to no fault of their own.

Hi there!My name is Jocelyn, Jocy for short. I am a Disabled creator on social media. Through my platforms, I not only share external resources but I educate, speak, and create on disability, ableism, and the intersections. My upbringing as a Disabled Mexican-American woman of color informs my intersectional perspective on top of my years in advocacy. I am crowdfunding a wheelchair accessible van as I want to be able to leave my house and gain some independence. For personal reasons, I cannot go through my state’s vocational or rehabilitation services. The amount listed is based off of a starting quote from BraunAbilityThis includes:Transfer Seat BasesHand Controls or Independent Driving SystemsSecurement SystemsKnowing myself, I believe I'll need more customizations to the van, so the amount will most likely be adjusted and go to extra accommodations, where I will be customizing it exactly to my body and needs, and driving lessons for people with disabilities.As you may or may not have heard, a tweet of mine went viral on March 11th, about me being forced to drop out of grad school because I wasn't accommodated beginning February. I found out my classmates were offered those accommodations a month later and I did what most angry, hurt persons do when stripped of an opportunity-- I vented on Twitter. This led to me being featured in a NowThis video (here ), and my story being shared with countless others. While I appreciated being in this conversation, I not only lost the chance to continue my education, but I also lost my on campus job, internship, community resources (like transportation), and even access to friends. I had to move back home since I had no support, and I went back to being housebound as before school. The fact is, if my town was accessible or I had the financial means to cover transportation or a wheelchair van, I wouldn't be housebound. I want to have some control back in my life, and having the ability to leave the house is what I really want and need, whether it's to get a job or go back to school (definitely not that one). Because we are still in the middle of a pandemic, there is no deadline for this and I cannot leave my house. I am just asking for any donations for my work to go to something that could help me gain independence later on. Any amount is greatly appreciated and sharing truly means a lot.If you’d like to hire me for any consultations, lectures, panels, trainings, organizing, speakings, lectures, or even sponsorships, feel free to reach out to me through my website or on any of my platforms.I appreciate you all!-Jocywebsite:https://www.jocyofthedragons.com/instagramhttps://www.instagram.com/jocyofthedragons/twitterhttps://twitter.com/jocyofthedragonfacebookhttps://www.facebook.com/jocyofthedragonsyoutubehttps://www.youtube.com/jocyofthedragons

Jay's father wants everyone to know how thankful he is of the support they have received during this difficult time. Information concerning services will be posted as they are finalized and decided upon by the family.Update 3/8/17: Jay is currently at hospice and breathing on his own. Continued thoughts and prayers are very much appreciated by his family.Update 3/6/17: Jay will be moved to hospice care today. The family asks for continued prayers and good thoughts. Update on 3/3/17:There was a meeting today at the hospital with all of Jay’s family members, a representative from the military, and Christina, representing his corporate family. This morning at 9:40AM the doctors in a very clear detailed manner explained to Jay what to expect and that the breathing apparatus is helping him stay alive. He was asked very clearly three times if he wanted to remain this way. They asked him yes or no questions in different ways and each time he immediately responded in the negative. They will be moving Jay to hospice either Sunday night or Monday. At that point, they will make him as comfortable as possible, give him the meds he needs for pain, and then remove the breathing apparatus. It could be minutes, it could be hours, but they don’t expect him to be able to sustain life on his own for a day.  We asked why this was happening so shortly after the stroke on Saturday as it has only been six days. The doctor said it is due to the location of the stroke and the type of stroke that occurred. The current stage that he is in, will be the stage he will remain. He has Locked-In Syndrome where the patient is aware but cannot move or communicate.   We asked if visitors are welcome the next two days. His father asks that any visits with Jay be brief, as this is very taxing on him.  **About JAY MITCHELL – our friend Jay works on the Finance Team at our Alpharetta Office and recently suffered a stroke on Saturday 2/25/2017. He wasn’t feeling well that morning and luckily his fiancé Toya took him to the hospital where they found a clot. He underwent emergency surgery and was placed in a medically induced coma as a result from Saturday’s stroke. Doctors’ have slowly reduced the amount of medication and Jay has since opened his eyes. He is able to blink his eyes when in pain, he did so for his arms and legs, which is good news. Doctors are monitoring him closely, only time will tell how well he will recover. We will keep everyone updated as much as we can.  Jay is only 28 and already a cancer survivor. He had cancer at the age of 10 and was part of the Make a Wish Foundation. Jay is currently in the Army Reserves. While on active duty, Jay served as Delta Company commander of the 1st battalion / 167th infantry regiment; ""4th Alabama"", where he saw two combat tours in Afghanistan. Jay is recently engaged to Toya, they have known each other since high school and Jay has helped raise Talin (8 years old) for the past 6 six years that they’ve been together.  As his co-workers, we have seen how generous Jay is with his time and commitment to helping others. No matter how stressed out or how hectic his day was, he always made himself available to others. He was a calming presence. His efforts to put other’s needs before his own is humbling and we are truly lucky to know him. He’s fought off cancer and fought for our country, now let’s fight for him and do what we can to help Jay through his road to recovery.  Recovery from a stroke is a lifelong process, please consider donating to alleviate the medical and rehabilitation bills so Jay and his family can focus on him getting better and getting back to the life he has ahead of him with Toya and Talin.Read more"

Raycer is currently paralyzed from the chest line down, but the spinal cord is not severed and he has made positive improvements during his time in the intensive care unit. The challenges are real. The hospital has social distancing restrictions that make it difficult to navigate through this. Raycer is a minor so only his parents are allowed to be with him at the hospital. This is difficult for Raycer's step parents, grandparents and siblings. They are not allowed to visit him or be by his side to hold his hand.The commutes to the hospital, the overnight stays, time away from Raycer's siblings and trying to manage their jobs is weighing heavy on Raycer's parents and the family.Raycer’s medical bills are expected to be substantial even after his insurance is applied. The extended stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), additional surgeries that will take place, physical rehabilitation and specialize equipment to help with mobility are the start of them.To help offset these costs a Go Fund Me campaign has be created to help out Raycer and his family in this great time of need.Raycer Frank has won a lot of snowmobile races.

At 8 years of age, Devlin lost the lower half of one of his legs to bone cancer. We ( Devlin, myself (mum) and his sister Zita had to move suddenly from Townsville to Brisbane so Devlin could go to paediatric oncology.After 12 months in Brisbane undergoing numerous of treatments, therapies and rehabilitation, we could come back to Townsville.Devlin still has to go regularly to the hospital and had since the below knee amputation numerous surgeries done.Not only did Devlin undergo physical trauma but mental trauma as well - the whole family did. Devlin loves animals and when Devlin was introduced to an assistance dog program it was the right choice to get him his own assistance dog.

Jinx is a gorgeous caramel and white Border Collie who has changed Devlin’s life more than I ever thought possible. I got her when she was a puppy and she went through lots of training with Devlin to become an assistance dog and has been fully qualified for a while now.Jinx is also Devlin’s best friend and the boost he needs everyday to keep a smile on his face.

When we got told by the vet that something was not quite right with Jinx’s heart and needed scans done, we weren’t expecting that Jinx needed life saving surgery.Jinx is only 2.5 years old and the specialist told us that Jinx has PDA. A vessel in the heart (that should close by birth) didn’t close after she was born.Her heart is now enlarged, we are lucky that she doesn’t have fluid in the lungs yet.The specialist has told us that she needs surgery ASAP. If she doesn’t receive the surgery she will deteriorate and might live up to one more year.

With all the consultations, scans, surgery, after care, etc., it has put a huge strain on our pockets. The costs are over $ 10.000.As a family of 3, we are doing everything possible to pay for Jinx’s surgery ourselves, however this is not a realistic outcome for us. We are asking, with much hesitation, for assistance to pay for Jinx’s life saving surgery. In turn, not only will Jinx continue to live a long, happy, healthy dedicated life as Devlin’s assistance dog but Devlin will continue to thrive throughout his teenage years and into adulthood with his best mate by his side.

Many thanks,Devlin, Jinx, Zita and Elvira

It is your warrior energy and unyielding prayers that is helping Bunmi to navigate this very challenging time. As most of you know by now on Tuesday, July 8th Bunmi survived a horrific skydiving accident when his parachute malfunctioned and did not deploy causing Bunmi to plummet 15,000 ft. Only a very small fraction of skydivers survive a fall from an unopened parachute. Bunmi is now counted in that number. However, what we know for sure is that Bunmi’s spirit is not broken. Instead, this near death experience has deepened his faith and commitment to the work he loves so much as the Director of Philadelphia’s Freedom School. Furthermore, Bunmi is looking forward to continuing athletic competition and other sports activities. We also know for sure that Bunmi has a long, arduous and unpredictable road ahead of him filled with hospital bills, custom treatment plans, rehabilitation, psychological, physical and occupational therapy, assistive devices and eventually home-based services. Many of you have reached out to Bunmi and the family to see what you might be able to do to help. Here’s how: 1) Keep praying and seeing Bunmi in divine light. I promise you he can feel it all. 2) In lieu of flowers, food or personal visits we are asking you, our community to make a contribution to our Go Fund Me campaign to help with the rapidly mounting costs of his after care. Bunmi is a warrior and will get through this ordeal, but his single focus at this time needs to be to rest and heal. Your support of our campaign will ensure that he is able to do just that without worry or stress. Please feel free to share, repost and circulate this letter among your networks. Any and all donations are greatly appreciated, and I look forward to providing you with updates on Bunmi’s progress. In closing I leave you with the words of our father Tunde Samuel. Rest assured we are ‘in the game still playing’! With deep gratitude, Taiye Samuel

After 109 days, Mike lost his battle with Covid-19, see Updates for details.... 

Mike was hospitalized Nov. 10, 2020 with Covid-19. It's now 98 days & counting. He is one of the small percentage of men who have been devastated by Covid-19. By the 27th, the virus & pneumonia had overwhelmed his lungs. He was placed in a medical coma, intubated and placed on a ventilator. His body went into shock & was hit with a life-threatening sepsis viral storm, threatening multiple organs with dysfunction and failure. I asked myself, how can this be happening? Mike was a healthy, energetic 56 yr. old who loves helping anyone who asks, works hard, loves his family & anything that has wheels! This picture was taken on our 34th wedding anniversary. I never would have guessed; we were already infected with Covid-19. I can't even describe the emotional roller-coaster ride we all were about to go through.Mike's symptoms were mild at first and we really thought it was only a cold. Within days his fever skyrocketed and by late afternoon on the 10th, his breathing and cough had worsened. A frantic video chat with a doctor verified he needed be at the emergency room now! I immediately drove to the emergency area which was now located outside, I dropped him at the front, turned the car around and parked. I did not see him again for 60 days. Thanksgiving and Christmas came and went. Daily we anxiously waited for doctors to call with updates while praying and living in a state of unreal reality. The Sepsis affected his lungs, heart, kidneys, and brain as well as the entirety of his skin which was covered with a crimson red rash. Several times we were called to inform us that he was so critical we needed to make a decision. I called my son Matthew and daughter-in-law, Rhiannon, they immediately dropped everything, flew in from New York to be with us, not only to discuss our options, but for much needed emotional support. They finally had to return home as it seemed he had stabilized. On New Year’s Day we were told that he had coded but had been revived. We were devastated.Doctors later performed a tracheostomy to assist long term ventilation due to the scarring in his lungs. He now has ARDS, (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). His kidneys need supportive care via dialysis and has a feeding tube to support his nutrition. Mike went through seizures caused by swelling of the brain and has almost continuous fevers from one infection after another. He has gone from 156 lbs. to 115 lbs. Hard to believe a person could survive what he has endured, but he has. He is our hero!Now days, we ask, plead, and nicely harass the hospital staff to be allowed to visit him as the hospitals are still on lock down due to the virus. We are also amazed by so many people who have been praying for him and we may never know who they all are, from east to west coast and even overseas. But we thank God for them!We are praying and believing he will reach a point of stability so his admission into a LTACH, a specialty hospital, to start another long journey, one of recovery & rehabilitation with hopes of being removed from the ventilator. As his doctor stated: ""this is a marathon not a sprint"". He must go through arduous Physical Therapy to learn to speak and eat, to build back atrophied muscles, grow stronger to walk again. This is why we need help.All I can do is make sure we, as his family, are his best advocates and promise all donations will go toward that effort, from almost losing his life to bringing him back to a full and healthy life. I thank you in advance for your consideration of Mike's needs, all your prayers and any donations.Adele Ramos and Family

She fought for her life for several days, and God was merciful to spare her, answering many prayers and granting miraculous healing. We briefly thought that the worst was over, until she began to experience complications from the sepsis when the tissue in her hands and feet began to die. Treatments were ineffective to heal them, and Paula's legs below the knees, and parts of all ten fingers, were amputated on October 31 and November 1. The reality that Paula is now a double (plus) amputee is only beginning to set in for her, for her husband Tim, and for her children, family and friends. Many, many changes are ahead for Tim and Paula, and they face continued challenges as they navigate Paula's healing, therapy, and rehabilitation.Paula and Tim's lives revolve around ministry, in their church, community, and home. They love Jesus with all their hearts and their lives are characterized by service to Him through serving others. Tim is a full-time director of church music and parochial school music teacher. Since they became empty-nesters, Paula transitioned from a full-time stay-at-home mom to a nearly full-time volunteer, giving her time, energy and talents in many ways. She speaks to moms at MOPS as well as caring for little ones, teaches Bible studies and Sunday School, mentors young women one-on-one, and opens their home in hospitality to many family, friends and to-be-friends.Paula's love language is food. She delights in preparing gourmet meals for anyone who comes to her table, and the kitchen is her favorite place.Our goal is to enable Tim and Paula to keep doing what they've been doing, just making it easier for them. They'll need a home that will not be an obstacle course for Paula in a wheelchair and, eventually, prosthetics. We would love to give her an amazing kitchen where she can continue to cook as she loves to do, with tools and other modifications for her ease of use with her now-limited dexterity and use of her fingers.Another priority for Tim and Paula is to have room for hosting family and friends, especially their own children and grandchildren.Beyond needing funds for a new home, our goal is to raise enough to cover all the costs for Paula's prosthetics, outpatient therapy, transportation to and from what will likely be VERY numerous therapy appointments, medical equipment for their home, and other expenses.We pray and trust that God will provide in such a way that finances will not be an additional burden and struggle for them during the most difficult time in their lives. Tim and Paula have spent their lives giving to others, being a blessing as they have been blessed by the Lord. What a joy and honor it is for us to be able to bless them in return!Read more"

He has had that big, beautiful smile since he was a baby. And every time you see him, his face lights up with that radiant smile, and you can feel his happiness at just seeing you. Right now, we are missing that beautiful smile as Bradley is using every ounce of his strength to recover from a medical emergency that happened this past Thursday.On Thursday, February 25th, Bradley didn’t make it in for his shift at work and no one was able to get in touch with him. When loved ones went to check on him, they found Bradley face down and unresponsive on the floor. He was clearly having a serious medical emergency and the paramedics made the decision to have him airlifted to Lubbock.For those that don’t know, Brad has Type I Diabetes. When the paramedics got to him on Thursday, his blood sugar level was off the charts. His doctors assume this is what caused his fall and the subsequent trauma to his head and brain. The traumatic brain injury that he sustained from his fall caused an epidural hematoma, bilateral ventricular hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, occipital bone fracture and frontal cranium fracture. On 2/26/21 Brad underwent emergency brain surgery, in which a Craniotomy with frontal bone flap removal was done. This procedure was necessary so that his brain had room to swell and/or bleed. Brad is hospitalized in the ICU, requiring continuous respiratory support by means of a ventilator.Our Brad remains in the ICU in Critical, but stable condition. He is showing small signs of improvement with reactions to his mom and his doctors, but they are taking it very slowly and watching his stats very closely. They are hoping to remove him from the ventilator as soon as they can, as prolonged intubation can have it's own complications and negative affects. Since Bradley had to be flown to Lubbock, his mom, Gabby, had to travel to Lubbock from Albuquerque to be by his side. In addition to the exhaustion from no sleep, the devastation and and heartache over seeing Bradley in his current state and in pain, there is also the worry about the cost that is going to add up quickly in the weeks and months ahead. There is also the unknown timeline for the road to recovery for Brad. Even after he is able to leave the hospital, there are most likely going to be several months of rehabilitation and recovery ahead of him. We know that Brad will have the positive outlook, courage, strength and grace to make it through this! And with the prayers and love of his friends and family we know he has an army behind him. But, the financial hardship that they are now being faced with is a very scary reality for them right now.We are asking for any size donation that you are able to spare. Our main goal now is to make sure his mom is able to stay by his side while he fights to come back to us. And we also hope that for the long term we can provide some financial cushion that will allow Bradley to focus on his rehabilitation 100%. We want to thank you all from the bottom of our hearts for whatever you are able to spare. And, please most of all, continue to pray for Bradley and his family!We love you all!Read more"

Yes, I’m doing a lot better but continue to have problems with muscle tone on the left side of my body, severe headaches and migraines, PTSD, anxiety and panic attacks. The muscles in my throat are weak. Sometimes I have trouble swallowing liquids and choke easily. I can’t just walk anywhere I want to go. The toes on my left foot are curled which makes me unbalanced. As a result, I have to get injections every three months to loosen the muscles in the bottom of my foot, ankle, calf, thigh, tricep, elbow, forearm, palm, and thumb. In addition to the injections, I have to take medication for pain and to relax my left side. Meanwhile, I continue to struggle for access to therapy and new, improved equipment.It’s a non-stop struggle. I can’t drive myself to school and doctor’s appointments. My father has Glaucoma, is losing his vision, and is frustrated that he can’t work. My mom continues working in human services as a Personal Care Assistant for the elderly and disabled. We can’t afford for her to finally retire.Stay tuned for news about my book that Chivas Sandage, my co-writer, is at work on!LGBTQ influencer Josh Helfgott just made a video about Mollie and me for TikTok.

Have had many requests off people to set up a donation page.. so here it is . 

My name is Francesca and I am currently in hospital after an injury sustained a few months ago. The injuries I sustained were a fractured skull, bleeding of the brain, broken back which in turn damaged my spinal cord. As a result to this injury I have been left wheelchair bound. I never realised by breaking your back/damaging your spinal cord leads to more complications than not just being able to walk (in my case). The amount of things that come with it is crazy and the simple things you have to learn, it's like starting from scratch all over again. I should be due to leave hospital soon, hopefully. 

The main point of setting up this fund me page is to help with the rehabilitation process following my accident and to help me continue to live as independent a life as possible in the future, and for this happen and make life as easy as possible I will need equipment and adaptations made to my surroundings all of which unfortunately are very expensive. 

Any amount donated is appreciated as it is one step closer to me leading a independent and as normal of a life as possible. 

Thank you lots of love xxxx

He was coming to the USA to spend time with his girlfriend Shelby and her family, the MacRitchies, at a small lake in a rural part of the state.Andreas is 29 years old, and full of love and life. He has a huge passion for staying active, and taking charge of his life. He loves cross-fit and exercises 6 days a week. He would execise 7 days a week if his gym in Austria would be open on Sundays. He loves comedy, American culture, and being independent. He is a self-made man building from the ground up his ownbusiness in affiliate marketing and becoming a rising star in that field.The small lakeside resort he was at the day of the accidenthad a swimming dock. And after night had fallen, Andreasdecided to go jump in the lake for a quick dip to wake himself up for when his girlfriend was to arrive. He didnot know that the lake was just 2 feet deep. Hedove into lake and fractured his C5 and C4 vertebrae in his neck.For 40 minutes he lay in the water, with people trying to stabilize him. From the very first moments he was taken care of and not allowed to move. Everyone on the scene knew how serious the accident was, and didnot want to risk any further injury.Eventually, a Life Flight helicopter arrived and evacuated him to St. Vincent's hospital in Toledo, Ohio. His girlfriend and her family rushed behind in a car. Thus began the harrowing journey that we are all still on today.After multiple surgeries, complications, and many sleepless nights we can now report that Andreas is stable. His injury is extremely traumatic, and he is likely to be a quadriplegic (without the use of his arms and legs). However there is a chance of him regaining function. We are hoping and praying everyday for his fast recovery.  He is still in the ICU in Ohio, and being prepared for transfer to a rehab hospital in his home country of Austria. He has had family and friends by his side at every step. And he will continue to have that support.We have learned through exhaustive research that the first year of rehab from a spinal cord injury is critical. It is the time when you have thechance of regaining function. Andreas will work harder in rehab than he has ever worked before. And he will have the love and support of his family and friends.But we also want him to have the freedom to pursue the best for his care. This means cutting-edge equipment, specilized computers for him to be able to use, and consults with experts around the world. There is a growing financial need to helphim have the chance moving forward with the best quality of life possible.Please donate whatever you can, and it will be going towards a very worthy individual who has a lot to live for. The gratitude and appreciation from the Funkl and MacRitchie families and from Andreas himself will be everlasting. If you want to make a large donation please contact us directly at [email redacted] for info on how to do that.And don't forget to spread his story. Please share this campaign wherever you can.

She has had trouble in school and has been held back which they now believe to be because of the tumor. Nikki has been experiencing bad headaches and is not able to concentrate. It has effected her peripheral vision and her memory. From the MRI they have done they cannot determine if it is cancer or benign. Either way, it is a long haul for a little girl to go through.The doctors in Tallahassee want her to go to Shands in Gainesville, FL for a 3 day EEG to determine seizure activity and also do a functional MRI to determine if the area will affect her speech when removed. This is scheduled for the beginning of April and from there things will move fast. Once removed, she will be in the hospital and need her mother to care for her during her rehabilitation. Nikki's mother will be out of work for a month, maybe more.That is why I am asking for donations to help this family. Nikki's mother works an hourly job as a pool cleaning technician.  She has faced great odds in her life and has become a successful single mother of three young children, 8,10 and 13. But now she faces this hurdle to keeping a roof over their heads. She has no extended family to help except her oldest son who is 19 who will be helping babysit the other kids while his mother is out of town. He was planning to work in the day but now with school out indefinitely they will have to pay for childcare or he will have to quit his job to watch the younger kids. They will have to drive to Gainesville multiple times during this process and will need gas money and emergency car repair funds. Please donate to help with regular monthly living expenses such a rent, utilities, insurance, gas, and other incidentals. This family has come so far and needs help to make this happen so this little girl can have a chance at a full recovery. No family should have to worry about basic survival when going through this type of stressful medical process. Left, current view of tumor. Right, previous MRI. (showing growth)Read more"

Bare with me, it's painful, that said if you can manage to keep it together to the end you may find comfort in your heart that Levi is going to be just fine.When I got to Levi as he lay on the track, I saw immediately there was a serious problem. Before the medic team asked ""can you feel here"" and he answered no, Levi was already processing the situation and his injury as he lay on the track.Levi knew full well he had a spinal cord injury as he was being transported from the track to Conemaugh memorial medical trauma center, 11 miles, about 20 minute ride. During most of these 20 minutes Levi with knowledge of his serious injury, the added pain of broken ribs and broken wrist was joking and keeping the mood lighthearted with the medic team. I was listening in from the passenger seat in awe of my sons composure and attitude. As Levi was carried off the ambulance, the medic team wished him well, they told him he was the most pleasant passenger they had ever transported.Next stop trauma room: A large team of medical professionals were waiting to receive Levi for X-rays, scans and stabilize his vitals. A short time later the doctor revealed the news to Levi and I and about the broken vertebra and damage to spinal cord and the urgent need for surgery.Levi and I were left alone for a few moments, he looked me square in the eyes and said ""Dad, I'm so sorry for what I'm putting you through, please don't tell Mom yet"". The only sadness he had in his eyes at this time was for Lise and I.That's our Levi, he's a ""special kind of special"". In his mind he had already assumed full responsibility for his circumstance and his first concern was not for himself but for his family.This is Levi, he's like no other person I've ever known, so kind, so smart, so grateful and assumes responsibility with maturity well beyond his 17 years. Lise and I are so blessed with all 4 of our kids and Levi is going to adjust to this, he's already began the mental adjustments knowing he has a great support system in his loving family and many friends.Fortunately we do have medical coverage for these initial huge costs.That said, Levi has several years of rehabilitation therapy ahead of him. These rehabilitation costs are extremely expensive as is and the need for specialized equipment, the insurance coverage is very limited.As a parent you think you have your basis covered with medical coverage, you load up your dirt bikes and anticipate at worst maybe a broken leg, fractured wrist, or a few stitches... not this. This is an injury you don't plan for.Most who read this message will be just like our family, spending every available cent getting your own kids to sports... I know this and just a quick prayer and sharing this message will be a wonderful gift to Levi, and greatly appreciated by our family.If you able to assist Levi to allow him the opportunity for the best rehabilitation therapy and equipment in the years ahead, Levi and our entire family would be forever grateful.But most of all I hope this message provides a level of comfort to you that Levi is very strong and surrounded by a loving family.If you would like to mail Levi a card with words of inspiration our address is:14294 Mossy Oak Ln, Myakka FL. 34251For those of you that may have not seen Levi's public release of his accident and injury you can view it BELOW:Levi's announcement Monday 15th June, two days after his surgery.Hi everyone unfortunately I have some bad news to share. I know there are rumors and speculations surrounding my accident this past weekend at pleasure valley regional qualifier as well my condition, I’d like to share the accurate accounts, this is the first opportunity I’ve have had to do so.Im currently recovering from my injuries and surgery in ICU at Conemaugh memorial hospital in Johnstown PA. I suffered broken ribs, wrist and some vertebrae. Unfortunately I also suffered spinal cord damage and currently have no feeling or movement below the chest.My parents are here with me and we are making plans to to get me to Florida closer to home at a rehab center. I really appreciate all your messages and texts sent to my parents asking about me. I had asked my Dad to give me the opportunity to release this news so to all of you that have messaged him please know it’s been difficult for him not to respond with greater detail.I want to thank Jeff Cernic the facility owner for his kindness to my parents and loaning them a vehicle and providing a nice place at the track for my parents to stay as they travel to and from track and hospital each day.This was my first time at the facility and I was really enjoying the racing. My goals were to get qualified for pro sport at this event the Loretta’s was to be my last amateur event before making my debut in the AMA outdoor 450 class championship.My focus now changes to getting as healthy as I can and adjusting to my current condition and working hard on improving my current condition. Obviously I hope to regain the feel and movement that I’ve lost below the chest and will be working hard to make that a reality.Before I go I’d also like to thank two individuals that have went out of their way to assist me over the past year. Todd Hicks at Fox has been very kind as well as Kyle @Moto4play.Lastly thank you to my family who have always been my biggest supporters. I truly appreciate the opportunity I had to chase a dream and goal.Ya this dream is not looking too sweet now from this bed in ICU but hey..... life is the longest of all motos and with the love and support of my family combined with my will to get better, I’m sure to achieve lots of wins in life after moto as I transition out of sport I’ve truly loved competing in.Wishing all of you the very best of luck at Loretta’s and beyond.Read more"

• Therapy

• Regular living expenses



I receive 58 provider hours per week which cover my day time hours but needa nighttime provider too.No family support makes the items listed above too hard too obtain with only $807 income a month I receive from SSI. My van hasn’t been driven since I went into the hospital the summer of 2019 and need it for transportation to get to & from doctors appointments. The wheelchair I’ve got now isno longer wide enough for my hips becauseof the previous operations, due to the severity of being in bed for two years, I need a lot of physical therapy and $500 for rent is why I need your help andsupport.

Upon returning home, Giselle unexpectedly fell off her bed, and as she struck the wood floor, she immediately felt that something was very wrong. Thankfully Kurt was there to immediately call 911 so she could be taken to the hospital.Giselle suffered a severe spinal injury. She underwent surgery to fuse two of her disks together; adding a new titanium plate to her spine. The medical team has worked diligently to support her recovery in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for nine days and she has now been transfered to an Acute Rehabilitation Unit. She currently does not have use of her hands or the ability to move her legs. Thankfully, though, Giselle’s condition has stabilized and she is on the road to a long recovery. She is beginning the “fight of her life” to regain her ability to walk and overcome the most difficult chapter of her life. Giselle is determined to walk, to dance and to come back stronger and better from this accident. She needs our help; help by supporting practicalities that have begun to become essentials to her recovery. She will need a lot in the coming months, much of which will not be covered by insurance. To name just a few things, she will consult with holistic practitioners, seek advice on nutrition and diet, and need to adjust her living environment to accommodate her current needs once she is able to come home. Your contribution to her recovery will be used to support and ease the new challenges and obstacles she will doubtless face.Giselle is passionate and working hard to return to the many students, families and staff that she has supported throughout the years as a psychiatric social worker.

These medications will have to be taken for the rest of his life. This fund raiser will help us get a head start in these cost. The funds will also help us to stay in close proximity of the hospital where the transplant will be completed. Having his transplant will require to stay close to the hospital where transplant is being done which is in Atlanta and 289 miles from where we live. We will be required to be in Atlanta for 6 weeks after transplant is completed. As his caregiver I will not be able to work for at least that timeframe.Please share with all of your friends and family. Any help will be truly appreciated! Elizabeth & AnthonyHello, my name is Elizabeth; I want to introduce you to my husband Anthony who is 44 years old. Anthony and I have been married for 23 years and we have 2 beautiful daughters who love their daddy very much. Having served in the US Army, Anthony has always tried to take care of himself, eating right and staying physically fit, however in 2006, we found out Anthony had kidney failure and in April, 2011 he began dialysis. Since then he has tried to make the best of his situation and continues to believe that it will get better for him. Regardless, Anthony’s health has deteriorated causing other ailments such as Neuropathy which makes it difficult for him to walk at times as well as causes him fatigue. Currently he spends most of his days on dialysis and is in need of a kidney transplant. If Anthony could get a transplant, it would greatly improve the quality of Anthony’s life. By having a transplant he would be able to get back to “LIVING”, being able to spend quality time with our family and enjoy life like he use too. Once transplant is complete, Anthony will still be required to take medication for the rest of his life to keep his kidney healthy. Currently, Anthony is on the Georgia Transplant list, we also have traveled to Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, FL to get on that list as well. In addition we also advocate for a live donor, so if you or anyone you know is interested in becoming a donor for my husband or one of the many American’s who are in need of a kidney, you can get information at the website below. Do you know that one in 10 American adults has some level of Chronic Kidney Disease or End Stage Renal Disease and is on Dialysis.

I am a former Marine and father of four girls. I was paralyzed just over a year ago in a medical accident. I was told I would never walk again.I could not and did not accept that I would not walk again and through many painful hours of physical therapy and rehabilitation, I'm now able to walk limited distances with the use of a walker or cane. This far, I have been able to come on my own with the love and support my family. But now, I am humbly in need of your help.There is a robotic brace that is not covered by insurance that will allow me to walk unassisted and more importantly will allow me to walk longer distances. Currently, I'm only able to walk short distances without my walker because my body is exhausted from having to swing my right leg around due to the injury. The robotic brace helps compensate for that and will provide me and my family a much better quality of life than we can achieve just through hard work and our own efforts.We have never asked for anything in our lives and wish we were able to overcome these financial barriers on her own. But we cannot, and we have learned over this past year that you get through times like these with the love of family, the support of friends and random acts of kindness. Thank you for your prayers, your time and if you are able, your contribution.God blessThe Flansbaum Family

THE SHORT STORY: 
Last July, our dear friend and colleague Matt Cowan suffered a cardiac arrest that placed him on a long road to recovery. He and his wife, Jessie Wagner, need your generosity to help get through this difficult time. (Read the full story below)
WHO IS MATT?If you're part of the independent music and documentary film communities, you probably know Matt and Jessie, or at least their work. Matt is a freelance musician and film editor, who has worked on many award-winning documentaries. Jessie is a brilliant musician who performs with talent like Kid Rock and Lenny Kravitz. WHERE, EXACTLY, ARE CONTRIBUTIONS GOING?100% of all donations are being delivered to Matt's family (parents Glenda and Dave; sister Jenny) to offset medical bills and also pay for his medical transport to California (est. $20,000 to $30,000), where he has a more expanded network of family who can help care for him. Matt cannot care for himself, so he's currently living in a NYC facility that insurance stopped paying for late last year (we're currently helping Jessie appeal this decision). The cost is $700 per day. Beyond hospital and rehabilitation home bills, Jessie faces additional expenses to keep Matt comfortable and in good care. She could no longer afford to keep their apartment, so she downsized to a smaller place and works whenever she can.
WHO WE ARE: 
We're Matt's friends and colleagues. He has worked on our films, helped us launch new projects and been a genuinely all-around great human being to us and others. With help from a chorus of people in the independent music and film communities who love Matt and Jessie, this GoFundMe campaign is shephered by Dawn Porter, Carol Bash and Marilyn Ness.

FROM MATT'S WIFE, JESSIE: 
""The day before the 4th of July last year was like any other day. I did a hair show, bought some clothes I didn’t need to buy, went home and packed my bags so I could drive to Virginia the next day to spend it with my mom. Matt seemed fine, except he went to bed very early and complained he couldn’t do all his push ups for the day. I went to bed after him, not knowing the my world would be altered in such an unimaginable and frightening way.I heard a crash in the middle of the night and ran into the kitchen to find Matt on his knees, gasping for air. As I dialed 911, my husband of 10 years, the organizer, the man who took care of everything in the house — from finances to appliances — passed out and turned blue. While fighting off the panic, I began to do chest compressions and desperately prayed for the paramedics to magically appear in the next two seconds. Time seemed suspended, but I knew it was passing because of the fatigue I was experiencing. One and two and three and four and five — over and over again. Finally, I heard the sirens and EMTs rushed upstairs. I hoped that this nightmare would soon be over. After a while, they got his heart started again. It took six shocks to his system. I followed after the ambulance in the police car thinking, ok... now it’s over. Now we’re going to go back to our lives. By the time I saw my husband again, I realized how wrong I was.Covered with sensors and tubes, I didn’t recognize the man in front of me. They told me his heart was beating. Why did he need all of this stuff to help him breathe and live if his heart was beating? What was going on? As the doctors pulled me aside, they explained that my husband suffered a cardiac arrest and didn’t get enough oxygen to the brain. The doctors weren’t very optimistic about his recovery and I should start thinking about his final wishes or, if he did survive, the kind of home he’ll be confined to for the rest of his life. I couldn’t believe these were my only two options. For a couple weeks, we prayed and cried and prayed again. Matt opened his eyes. We rejoiced. Matt wiggled a toe. We praised the heavens. Slowly, but surely, he began his fight back to the land of the living. For almost two months, we watched these minute changes and thought, “yes, this is it! He’s going to be Matt by Thanksgiving. He’ll be home and everything will be the same!” Again, I didn’t realize that our hard-won progress would continue at a snail's pace. I've learned that trying to rush it is as futile as trying to breathe underwater. I thought this phase was the most difficult. I never knew I’d just begun the biggest challenge of my life.
Matt entered rehab in the middle of September of last year, around two months after his cardiac arrest. In the beginning, he resisted the therapy. He didn’t understand the purpose — even though he couldn’t walk, or hardly speak, and still had tubes coming out of his body. Then he developed behavioral issues that posed further hindrances to his recovery. It’s hard to describe a man that looks like my husband, but is completely alien to me. The anger, the violence, the fear and paranoia. It was unbearable for him and for me. I spent many nights just praying that today would be a good, that today we wouldn’t have to needlessly go back to the hospital because of his confusion. I prayed so hard, ""Please, let him gain some kind of understanding.""Month after month, the days dragged by with tension, apprehension and fear, and I began to wonder if a breakthrough would ever happen. On top of this, the insurance stopped paying. “He’s not making enough progress fast enough,” they said. Then, the landlord raised our rent and I had to scramble to find something affordable nearby. I’ve spent all day, every day, at the facility — unless I have to work. That’s the only time I get some extra sleep. There was a time the facility begged me to stay there. So I was spending day and night there, losing myself and my own sanity. There’s always the constant worry of how am I going to pay the rest of those hospital bills when they come to collect? How will I pay the facility if I can’t get Medicaid? A couple of weeks ago, I had a nervous breakdown. I began pulling my hair out and scratching my face and I screamed to the heavens — “I can’t do this anymore! Help me!” I’ve reached my breaking point. I need help.I don’t regret being here for him. I know he would do the same for me. The kind and loving man that I fell in love with and married is still there — and he is emerging, slowly, more and more each day. He has finally accepted the need for therapy and he works hard to regain the life skills he’s forgotten. He’s starting to eat through his mouth and he’s standing and walking. He can make intelligible conversation. Thankfully, he is becoming the man I used to know. But he still grapples with fear and a crippling need for me to be around at all times. I know he could thrive if I could get him to California. That’s where his family is, whom he misses desperately. Also, I could get some much needed help so that I can continue to work and provide for us and secure our future. But also, I need some rest so I can stay strong to take care of us. That’s easier said than done, and that’s why I am asking you for help.  Because of the behavioral issues that surfaced, Matt isn’t cleared for commercial flight. He will have to have medical transport. That kind of flight costs $30,000. In addition to that, I’ll need to pay out of pocket costs for rehab care until I can secure California insurance for him. That is estimated to be an additional $10,000 - $15,000.Beyond that, I still have hospital bills, and facility care bills here in New York. I’ll find a way through. I just want to get Matt somewhere he can be happy, safe, and surrounded by the love of his family for his continued growth, health, and rehabilitation. I’m grateful for anything, anyone can contribute. I know that there is a light at the end of this tunnel and that Matt, a man with a beautiful spirit and loving soul, will find his way back to himself.""

Up to Meadows they went to do what they do most weekends, feed their spirit on the mountain. Saturday would turn out to be a very different snow boarding trip. Arch, an expert snowboarder, was taking a run when his board slipped in a patch of ice under the powder. This flung him to his back with enough force to critically injure his spinal cord. He was taken to OHSU as a trauma patient and remains a patient in the ICU. He has very little movement from the neck down. The surgeons and medical Professionals paint a hopeful picture for the future but only after very intensive rehabilitation inpatient therapy.

I was with Preston & Finley. Arch was taking a normal easy cruise with the girls down north canyon when he hit a gigantic ice boulder with his heel edge, hiding under the newly fallen snow, falling on his back. The fall resulted in instant paralysis. Georgia came upon him and thought the worst. She fell apart but managed to call Shelly. Jaclyn came on the scene like a champ, pulled it together & flagged ski patrol. Arch was taken via ambulance to OHSU. He had emergency surgery (laminoplasty) Saturday evening to decompress his cervical spinal cord. C2-3-4-5-6.He’s at OHSU recovering then it is expected he will be placed in a rehab facility.-He is strong. He will be back.As he is essentially a prisoner in his own body right now and he is extremely emotionally unstable.

Dylan broke his C6 & C7 vertebrae leaving him immobile and with loss of bodily functions from his chest down. He was brought by ambulance to Mass General in Boston and into emergency surgery. Fortunately, because he got into surgery quickly and had an amazing medical team, it went as well as can be hoped. After about a week in ICU, Dylan was moved to Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital where they have begun rigorous rehabilitation therapy. He has begun responding to the therapy and has had some sensation and movement return in his legs and hands. He has a long road to recovery, but we are all hopeful. He is young and determined. DYLAN STRONG!Dylan is expected to remain at Spaulding for a few months and then will move to his parents, Anne Marie and Dave Allwine’ s, home in N.H. While it’s still too early to know exactly what accommodations Dylan will need, Anne Marie and Dave have been advised by the staff at Spaulding to start preparing their home for him. They will need to renovate their home to accommodate Dylan by building ramps, a handicap accessible bathroom, widening doors, and other adaptations. He will also need on-going medical care, physical and occupational therapy among other services, many of which are not covered by insurance. While we don’t know yet exactly what the expenses will be, at this point we are estimating tens of thousands of dollars.For those who don’t know Dylan, he is a 25 year old amazing musician and music teacher and an even better person. He loves hiking, travel, cooking, rock climbing, jazz, and is a wine connoisseur and watch collector. If you've seen him play with his band Copilot, you've seen his infectious smile behind his drum kit. If you've had the chance to meet him, you know how much his love of life can light up any room. He is beloved by so many- family, friends, band members, music students, employers and the love of his life, Lexi. We all really believe he can accomplish a miracle here. All the love and support that you can give him will help speed his recovery along. Please help Dylan and his family by donating to help with the many expenses they will incur bringing Dylan home and caring for him over the next few years. Dylan has been receiving cards and well-wishes from people from all over the country and is so grateful for the outpouring of love and support. Anything you can contribute would be greatly appreciated!Added 7/29/20Go Fund Me requires that I explain a few things here. I am Nancy an old friend of the Allwine family. I've known Dylan's parents Anne Marie and David for 30+ years— so longer than Dylan has! I live in Wolfeboro, NH where Dylan was born and raised. We've made David Allwine (Dylan's Dad) the official beneficiary so that he can withdraw the funds. Anne Marie and David need to start making renovations to the house in anticipation of Dylan coming home from rehab in early September. They will start withdrawing the funds as soon as we can get it set-up. An accessibility consultant has already visited their home and they have started planning. Spaulding Rehab has been so helpful connecting them with resources like a fund to which they can apply to help pay for a lift to get Dylan into the house ($10k for the lift). And the medical bills are starting to come in. Thank goodness Dylan is 25 and was able to still be on Dave's health insurance! Lexi's family have a dear friend who is a builder and has offered to come to their home to do some work. They're trying to make every penny that has been donated stretch out to do the most possible.

For the last 9 years my life has had more than it's fair share of complications, but I continue to 'stay strong' and firmly believe that one day in the future I will walk again and ride with my two boys.I moved out to California as an 18 year old with dreams of becoming a professional BMX Dirt Jumper, and managed to not only fulfil that dream but achieve things I could never have imagined possible for a kid from Newcastle. Now 18 years on, the time has comefor me to move back home to England with my two sons Seth and Mason. The last 9 years have been incredibly financially draining on my family and the reality is that it is unsustainable for me to continue living in the US. Additionally, in the last 4 months, I have suffered 3 severe bouts of hospital inducing pneumonia and I know that the best place of care for Seth, Mason and myself is back home in England with my family.The costs of moving back home to England are enormous (I have spent 18 years of my life here) and their are further significant costs involved once there such as housing modifications for wheelchair accessibility, rehabilitation equipment and physiotherapy programmes to name but a few. Additionally, it will take up to 2 years for me to receive full disability benefits (having lived outside of the UK for such a long time)so the immediate future will certainly be financiallydifficult, although I know that long term thisis the right move for us all.My friends have told me I should set up this page to help make this move a reality. I continue to be overwhelmed by the support i'm still receiving such a long time after the accident, and can't thank you all enough.Stay StrongStephenP.S.

However, while he has been hospitalized, his paycheck has been reduced to a short term disability check, cutting his income by 90%. The doctors have stated that once his is able to come off of the ventilator, he will require an extensive amount of rehabilitation in a rehabilitation center to re-learn how to use his limbs and basic functions such as walking and focusing. He will also possibly require dialysis at least 3 days per week. His wife will have to take him to these appointments, and she hasn’t been able to work since he was hospitalized and is no longer receiving a paycheck.

This will take place July 23 at Holy Cross Hospital. After 7 surgeries last year to save his leg, it’s been determined by his vascular surgeon that amputation is the next and best course of action for him.After his surgery, Mike cannot return to our home right away because we live in a townhouse with many steps. He is looking for a one level place to live with a possibility for a temporary wheelchair ramp. Home health will come attend to medical needs, but he will also need someone able to stay with him when home health isn’t there in the post-op days. We are grateful for medical coverage we have through Todd’s work at the school! One specific item we are asking for: if anyone is aware of a ground level room and bathroom he might be able to use from August-November.At this time, due to medical expenses and COVID-19 affecting Todd’s additional work as a musician, we do not have financial means in hand to provide all of this for him. All across the world, we know everyone is experiencing unique levels of challenge. For us, the financial piece and a place to live are the most daunting parts in front of our eyes. We are all taking on whatever additional work we can find to that end. We are personally unable to provide him with all the care he needs because we are working multiple jobs. Coupled with $2400 medical expenses remaining from last year, it would seem to our eyes a mountain of what lies ahead. If we are unable to find a home for him, we will need to find a nursing care facility. All expenses will be designated for medical and housing needs. Whew - this will be quite the adjustment for our family. We believe in the power of prayer and community. The post-op recovery and rehabilitation learning to use a prosthetic leg for Mike are challenging but our faith is strong as we reach out and do all we are able to do.

She is the first to volunteer to help in any way possible, whether it's giving her time, money, or talents. If she's not at work or at home with her dad and son, she's visiting her daughter and loving on her grandbabies! Unfortunately now, the woman who lends a hand to all, needs our help.❤️Currently, Lori is fighting for her life in the SICU at UAB Medical Center. Some of the devices helping her to win the battle are a tracheal tube, ventilator, feeding tube, and dialysis machine. The only thing the doctors are sure of is that her recovery will be a long journey (inpatient long-term rehabilitation center, then in-home therapy once she's out of the woods). She's been unable to work for 3+ months, and Logan has been by her side since she was admitted at UAB (over 3 weeks ago), also away from work. Medical and personal bills (house, room/food for Logan, etc) have become a heavy burden as they have a limited source of income at this time.

We truly appreciate the time you took to read this as well as your prayers and donations!️To get the word out, please share this link on your Facebook timeline and other social media outlets! #liftingupLori #strongerthansepsisThe 3 month-ongoing journey:In April, Lori suffered from what she thought was food poisoning so she left work and drove home. After an hour, the pain was so excruciating that she had her son drive her to the ER and found out she'd experienced a painful bout of severe pancreatitis. Her doctors were relieved she'd come in because of the necrosis (dying tissue) her pancreas developed in such a short time. She was admitted to the ICU for a week and released--she had a cyst on her pancreas, necrosis, and a gallbladder that needed to be removed.May was spent recovering and traveling to several dr appointments a week for numerous scans, and IV therapies. She could not keep down any food/water and grew to be severely malnourished. Slowly, her skin and eyes began to take on a yellow hue but her drs didn't seem worried. She was asked to wait another 2 weeks for the cyst to harden and surgery was scheduled for June 15th to drain it and remove her gallbladder.In the wee hours on June 15th, Logan awoke to find Lori passed out on the floor in front of his bedroom. After waking her up and dragging her to a chair, he called 911. ER doctors determined she'd passed another stone but this time it got blocked in her bile duct, so she underwent a minor surgery to put a stint in and open her bile duct. They then admitted her for a week because of her now stressed and unhealthy liver, and discharged her again (for 2-4 weeks) to gain strength for the original surgery.Meanwhile, her GI found that she was eligible to have the surgery done laparoscopically at UAB Hospital on July 6th. She arrived in Birmingham the night before so she could rest. At 5am Logan woke up to the sound of Lori moaning in pain. He helped her to sit up and watched as she started to cry out. She was in the worst pain she'd ever experienced so he called 911. The doctors found that the large cyst on her pancreas was actually an infection-filled abscess which had burst and sent Lori into septic shock. The doctors thought she may not survive due to the effects of sepsis. But by God's grace and her perseverance, she pushed through the emergency surgeries to remove the infection.Read more"

I would like to thank whoever wrote it for taking the time to bring these truths together and inscribing them into the memories of all who care to read and truly understand.  JUST A DOG  From time to time, people tell me, “lighten up, it’s just a dog,” or “that’s a lot of money for just a dog.”  They don’t understand the distance traveled, the time spent, or the costs involved for “just a dog.”  Some of my proudest moments have come about with “just a dog.”  Many hours have passed and my only company was “just a dog,” but I did not once feel slighted.  Some of my saddest moments have been brought about by “just a dog,” and in those days of darkness, the gentle touch of “just a dog” gave me comfort and reason to overcome the day.  If you, too, think it’s “just a dog,” then you probably understand phrases like “just a friend,” “just a sunrise,” or “just a promise.”  “Just a dog” brings into my life the very essence of friendship, trust, and pure unbridled joy.  “Just a dog” brings out the compassion and patience that make me a better person.  Because of “just a dog” I will rise early, take long walks and look longingly to the future.  So for me and folks like me, it’s not “just a dog” but an embodiment of all the hopes and dreams of the future, the fond memories of the past, and the pure joy of the moment.  “Just a dog” brings out what’s good in me and diverts my thoughts away from myself and the worries of the day.  I hope that someday they can understand that its’ not “just a dog” but the thing that gives me humanity and keeps me from being “just a man” or “just a woman.”  So the next time you hear the phrase “just a dog,” just smile, because they “just don’t understand.”  ~Unknown Author~MISHKA AND MYSELF THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP,EVEN IF YOU CAN ONLY SPREAD THIS MESSAGE.Read more"

As their lease ends after three years of renovating and improving the place, thelandlords have finally decided to take their houseback, and the shelter is now looking to purchase land and build the puuurrrfect place for their cat rescue mission.Mishi Wasi means “ The Home of the Cats”, and it is a very unique idea : A cat shelter & a guest house where traveling cat lovers can stay the night by donating to their cat rescuing mission.As a cat shelter, Mishi Wasi has brought a touch of hope within the animal protection community, as Perú is a country with hundreds of thousands of stray animals that need care and sterilization. Thanks to their cheerful and friendly approach to rescuing, they have quickly become a cornerstone of the community, and a place that everyone recognizes as a safe haven to bring any abandoned or stray cat in the Sacred Valley.Mishi Wasi offers rescue, rehabilitation, and neutering/spaying of street cats. They organize weekly guided adoption events and provide follow-ups with adopted cats to ensure safe and responsible placement. They organize massive sterilization events for FREE to their local community, and educate the population of the Sacred Valley about responsible cat ownership. Recently, Mishi Wasi has developed a strong presence on local radio, TV, and social media, where they have quickly become an icon for helping stray animals. They are rapidly changing the culture around street animals in the Sacred Valley and the entire Cusco region, and becoming a strong voice within the cat-loving community in Perú and South America.WHY IS MISHI WASI IMPORTANT?In the three years they have been operating, Mishi Wasi has done over 1000 FREE sterilizations, hundreds of successful rehabilitations and adoptions, and has changed so many cats lives forever. Even thought they are a cat shelter, their sterilization events have taken care of street dogs as well. They have performed so many sterilizations in partnership with two local dog shelters that it is now rare to see puppies on the streets of Urubamba, the largest city in the Sacred Valley.WHAT DOES MISHI WASI NEED?Even thought they have found homes for hundreds of cats, Mishi Wasi does not own their own casa! They have been paying rent since day one, and as they have grown, the rent has gone up to a price they can no longer afford. On top of that, the landlord has placed many restrictions on what can be done with the space, and is now looking to move back into his house and let the shelter go by December of 2020.Renting another space would be an option, but landlords in the Sacred Valley turn their head away when they hear the word ""cats"" , particularly when it goes together with the word ""many""... and in any case, renting a space would have too many limitations for what the shelter is trying to achieve.Mishi Wasi needs to purchase a space to call their own. A space that can care for all kinds of cats - indoor cats, outdoor cats, and even cats with special needs. They need space for cats that get along with other cats, and cats who don’t. They need quarantine spaces for new arrivals, a nursery for female cats who arrive about to give birth, and a very much needed safe space for kittens. They need a reception, an adoption room, plus a few rooms and bathrooms for volunteers, guests, and eventual employees as well.Most importantly, they need space for a veterinary clinic that will not only bring income to the shelter, but also help care for the animals at only the cost of materials and medications.Owning their own casa would mean that all of their revenue would go directly to the shelter - for cat food and supplies, for medications, for the much needed massive sterilization campaigns in their community, and to be able to offer a much safer and better life for all of their rescues.Your donation would help to make this beautiful dream come true!THANK YOU SO MUCH!<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>ESPAÑOL :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::MISHI WASI es el nombre del Refugio para gatos más hermoso y querido en el Perú.Su contrato de alquiler llega a su fin en diciembre del 2020 después de tres años de remodelar y mejorar el lugar, los propietarios finalmente han decidido recuperar su casa, por lo que el refugio está buscando comprar un terreno y construir el lugar perfecto para su misión de rescatar gatitos en todo el Valle Sagrado de los Incas. Mishi Wasi significa ""La casa de los gatos"" y es una idea única y original: un refugio para gatos y una casa de huéspedes donde los viajeros amantes de los gatos pueden pasar la noche por una donación para colaborar con su misión de rescate. Como refugio para gatos, Mishi Wasi ha traído un toque de esperanza dentro de la comunidad protectora de animales, ya que el Perú es un país que tiene cientos de miles de animales callejeros que necesitan cuidados, protección y esterilización. Gracias a su enfoque optimista y amigable para sus labores de rescate, se han convertido rápidamente en una piedra angular de la comunidad y un lugar que todos reconocen como un refugio seguro para cualquier gato abandonado o callejero en el Valle Sagrado. Mishi Wasi ofrece rescate, rehabilitación y castración/esterilización de gatos callejeros. Además, organizan semanalmente eventos de adopción guiada y brindan seguimiento a los gatos adoptados para garantizar que vivan con una familia segura y responsable. Asimismo, organizan eventos de esterilización masiva GRATUITA para su comunidad local y educan a la población del Valle Sagrado sobre la posesión responsable de gatos. Recientemente, Mishi Wasi ha desarrollado una fuerte presencia en la radio, la televisión y las redes sociales locales, donde se han convertido rápidamente en un ícono para ayudar a los animales callejeros. Su trabajo sostenido ha ayudado a cambiar rápidamente la cultura de los animales callejeros en el Valle Sagrado y en toda la región de Cusco y se está convirtiendo en una voz potente dentro de la comunidad amante de los gatos en Perú y Sudamérica. ¿POR QUÉ MISHI WASI ES IMPORTANTE? En los tres años que Mishi Wasi viene trabajando ha realizado más de 1000 esterilizaciones GRATUITAS, cientos de rehabilitaciones y adopciones exitosas, y ha cambiado la vida de muchos gatos para siempre. Aun siendo un refugio para gatos, sus eventos de esterilización también han beneficiado a cientos de perros callejeros. Han realizado tantas esterilizaciones en asociación con dos refugios para perros locales, que actualmente es raro ver cachorros en las calles de Urubamba, la ciudad más grande del Valle Sagrado. ¿QUÉ NECESITA MISHI WASI? A pesar de haber hallado hogar para cientos de gatos, ¡Mishi Wasi no es dueño de su propia casa! Ellos han pagado un alquiler desde el primer día y, a medida que el proyecto ha ido creciendo, el alquiler ha subido a un precio que ya no es posible pagar. Además de eso, el propietario ha impuesto muchas restricciones sobre el uso del espacio y desea recuperar el terreno para diciembre del 2020, de este año. Alquilar otro espacio sería una opción, pero los propietarios en el Valle Sagrado desvían la cabeza cuando escuchan la palabra ""gatos"", particularmente cuando va unida a la palabra ""muchos"" ... y, en cualquier caso, alquilar un espacio conlleva limitaciones para los objetivos y metas del refugio. Mishi Wasi necesita comprar un espacio propio. Un espacio para poder cuidar a todo tipo de gatos: gatos de interior, gatos de exterior e incluso gatos con necesidades especiales. Necesitan un espacio para gatos que se llevan bien con otros gatos y gatos que no. Espacios de cuarentena para los recién llegados, una guardería para las gatas que llegan a punto de dar a luz y un espacio, muy importante y necesario, para los gatitos pequeños. Además, es necesaria una Sala de Recepción, una Sala de Adopción, así como algunas habitaciones y baños para voluntarios, invitados y también eventuales empleados. Y lo más importante es tener un espacio para una clínica veterinaria que no solo genere ingresos para el refugio, sino que también ayude a cuidar a los animales pagando solo el costo de los materiales y medicamentos. Ser dueños de un espacio propio significaría que todos los ingresos irían directamente al refugio: para comida y suministros para gatos, para medicamentos, para las campañas de esterilización masiva tan necesarias en su comunidad y para poder ofrecer una vida mucho mejor y más segura para todos sus rescatados. ¡Tu donación puede ayudar a hacer este hermoso sueño realidad! ¡MUCHAS GRACIAS POR HACERLO POSIBLE!<<<>>>Read more"

He fractured his C7 vertebrate in his neck resulting an injury to his spinal cord causing the paralysis from the chest down. He’s also having problems moving his arms and hands as of now. He has a broken pelvis, knee cap, foot, and fractured ribs. Unfortunately his injured spinal cord isn't curable as of today. He's facing paralysis for the rest of his life and that will take a dramatic lifestyle adjustment and long rehabilitation. Romek has been in the hospital / critical care unit since last week and will hopefully be transferred over to a rehabilitation facility next week, where he'll undertake months of rehabilitation and learn how to perform daily tasks. After that he’ll most likely need a full time care. Roman also had no medical insurance at that time. His only close family here is his daughter, 11 yr. old Julia that loves and misses him very much.There’ll be countless costs involved with his recovery including medical bills, rehabilitation costs, special equipment, home customization, life expenses, and caregiver’s assistance. We're asking everyone to help. Thank you for caring and please share this on your facebook, email, text or any other way of communication with anyone that could potentially help too. Your contribution will be greatly appreciated by us, his family in Poland, his daughter, friends and of course him. Let's all come together and help Romek recover soon to the best of his ability so he can return to a somewhat normal life doing what he loves the most - spending time with his daughter and creating beautiful art.ps.

I have known her since she was 10 years old. For many years, I saw her every day at school, watching her grow and mature. Although we have losttouch over the years, the heart belongs to the people whom you do not forget, andfor many a teacher, there are students who keep hold of those special places.    Through social media, I was able to watch my students finish their studies, start families and careers,and achieve happiness. Thus, the news of Adam’s illness, and the heartache of Aneta and her husbandTom has devastated me. I am going to help, but the resources I have available are inadequate for theirneeds. As such, I will appeal to all people of good will to help Aneta, Tom, and Adam.   Here is a word from Aneta, little Adam’s mother:   ""With exemplary terms and strict medical supervision, everything was great. Childbirth was also fastand without complications. Adam got a 10-point APGAR score. Our pregnancy was perfect.After many years of waiting, this was our first child. The world’s happiest mother carried a joyfor 2 days. On day 3, we learned from the doctor that a terrible death sentence has been passed onmy son – Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA, type-0). As there is no cure for this disease, I was told that hewould not live to see his first year. All we could do is wait for the worst, while his muscles slowly withered away until his respiratory system failed and he suffocated.   Part of me has died. I cannot describe the suffering that my husband and I feel. After seeing Adam,seemingly healthy, and feeling such happiness, how could we talk about death so quickly? And abouta week-and-a-half later, test results confirmed this terrible diagnosis. It is the most painful helplessness.How can I just wait for my child to die?   I do not know the words that could express our despair. We love Adam more and more with every minute that passes. The great joy of being a parent, holding and hugging our greatest happiness, ismixed in with bitterness, the shedding of a thousand tears, and a sense of injustice. What has our littleangel done, that he can barely open his eyes to the world, a world has already turned hard on him?   But, despite a clear diagnosis, and the realization that this disease is not treated, we did not give up.Adam has a daily rehabilitation regime, because we believe taking care of his muscles makes sense. Wewant Adam with us as long as possible, and will never step down!   Our persistence in seeking information on SMA has gotten us in touch with several clinics in variousparts of the world, where experimental research on a cure for SMA is being conducted. There is a lightat the end of the tunnel! There is hope! We will do anything to rescue our little Adam!The costs that are connected with Adam’s current treatment, as well as his possible future treatment, have exceededour financial capabilities. Daily physiotherapy is coming out to about 1200 zl (approx 400 US $) per month.Life-sustaining medical specialty equipment will cost about 60,000 zl (approx. 20,000 US $), including anose-and-throat suction pump, a ventilator, a pulse oximeter and oxygen tank, and an ambo bag withother equipment for manual ventilation. We are also raising funds for travelling to experimental clinics abroad.   It is with all of my heart that I ask, please help us in our fight for the life of our little Adam.   For that reason, I give a heartfelt request to anyone who is able, to please help in raising fundsfor this young couple, who are doing everything they can to keep their baby with them. So many of theirfriends are helping to raise funding in Poland, and they’ve shown Aneta and Tom that they are not alone in what has been the most difficult time of their lives. Every little bit, every small gesture, anythingwill help. Thank you very much for your kindness and generosity!gofundme.com/adasskrzypekNazywam się Wioletta Ciepły.   Anetkę Skrzypek, mamę siedmiotygodniowego Adasia, znam odkąd skończyła 10 lat. Przez wiele lat spotykałam ją codziennie w szkole, patrząc jak rośnie i dojrzewa. Choć na długi czas straciłyśmy osobisty kontakt, to należy ona do ludzi, których się nie zapomina i do tych uczniów, którzy na zawsze zapadają w serce nauczyciela. Dzięki mediom społecznościowym mogłam obserwować swoich uczniów, jak kończą studia i zakładają rodziny, jak są poprostu szczęśliwi. Tym mocniej przeżyłam wiadomość o chorobie synka Anetki i Tomka, jej męża. Bardzo chciałabym pomóc, ale sama nie dysponuję odpowiednimi środkami, dlatego zwracam się do wszystkich ludzi dobrej woli o wsparcie dla Anety i jej rodziny.Oto, co młoda mama mówi o sytuacji swojej rodziny:   „Ciąża przebiegała wzorcowo pod ścisłą kontrolą lekarzy. Poród również szybki i bez komplikacji. Adaś dostał 10 pkt w skali Apgar. Miało być idealnie...    Jest to nasze pierwsze, wiele lat oczekiwane dziecko. Najszczęśliwszą mamą na świecie byłam jedynie tylko 2 dni... w trzeciej dobie po porodzie usłyszałam od lekarza straszną diagnozę równoznaczną z wyrokiem śmierci mojego synka: choruje on na rdzeniowy zanik mięśni (SMA-typ 0). Powiedziano mi, że nie dożyje roku, że nie ma na tę chorobę lekarstwa, że nic się nie da zrobić, a jedynie można czekać na najgorsze; że jego mięśnie będą powoli obumierać aż, nastąpi niewydolność oddechowa i najprawdopodobniej udusi się...    Coś we mnie umarło. Nie znam słów, by opisać cierpienie moje i mojego męża. Nie dowierzaliśmy. Po Adasiu na pierwszy rzut oka nie widać żadnej choroby, a co dopiero mówić o śmierci i to tak szybko! Badanie genetyczne 1,5 tygodnia później niestety potwierdziło tę straszną diagnozę. Najboleśniejsza była niemoc. Jak mogę po prostu czekać, aż moje dziecko umrze?   Nie znam słów, jakie mogłyby wyrazić naszą rozpacz. Z każdą chwilą kochaliśmy Adasia coraz mocniej. Ta ogromna radość z bycia rodzicem i tulenia naszego najwiekszęgo szczęścia przeplatała się z rozgoryczeniem, tysiącem wylanych łez, poczuciem niesprawiedliwości. W czym zawinił nasz mały Aniołek, że ledwo otworzył swe oczka na tym świecie, a już ma tak ciężko?   Jednak mimo jednoznacznej diagnozy oraz otrzymania informacji, że tej choroby się nie leczy, nie poddaliśmy się. Codziennie rehabilitujemy Adasia, bo wierzymy, że dbałość o jego mięśnie ma sens. Chcemy, by był z nami jak najdłużej, nigdy nie odpuścimy!   Nasz upór w szukaniu informacji na temat SMA zaowocował. Udalo nam się skontaktować z kilkoma klinikami w różnych zakątkach świata, gdzie trwają eksperymentalne badania kliniczne nad lekiem na SMA. Widzimy światełko w tunelu. Jest nadzieja! Zrobimy wszystko, by ratować naszego Adasia! Wiąże się to jednak z kosztami, które przekraczają nasze możliwości finansowe. Codzienna rehabilitacja wynosi ok. 1200 zł miesięcznie. Zakup specjalistycznego sprzętu medycznego ratującego i podtrzymującego życie wyceniono nam na ok. 60 000 złotych (w tym m.in ssak do odkrztuszania i usuwania wydzieliny z nosa i krtani, pulsoksymetr do monitorowania saturacji, butla z tlenem, worek ambu do prowadzenia ręcznej wentylacji, koflator stymulujący kaszel i inhalator). Ponadto koszt wyjazdu na badania eksperymentalne za granicą jest ogromny.Dlatego z całego serca prosimy o pomoc w walce o życie dla naszego Adasia.”To wszystko wymaga ogromnych jak dla młodych rodziców sum, dlatego zwracam się z serdeczną prośbą do wszystkich, którzy mogą pomóc w zebraniu środków dla tych ludzi, którzy robią wszystko, aby ich wyczekany maluszek pozostał z nimi. Wszyscy ich znajomi zbierają fundusze w Polsce i pokazują Anecie i Tomkowi, że nie są sami w najtrudniejszym momencie ich życia. Liczy się każdy gest. Pokażmy, że nie jesteśmy obojętni. Każda, nawet najmniejsza wpłata jest ważna! Dziękuję serdecznie w imieniu rodziców Adasia za Waszą dobroć i szczodrość!Pieniądze można wpłacać w Stanach Zjednoczonych na stroniegofund.me/adasskrzypekRead more"

He is meant to be focusing on his physical rehabilitation but said he was spending most of his time worrying about how he would meet the demand for payment, given that he has no savings, is the main breadwinner for his family and is currently too unwell to work. The bill is increasing by around £1,500 for every day he remains an inpatient.Anyone who has served in our country's armed forces deserves the respect and dignity of our nation. Taitusi Ratucaucau is a two time war veteran and should be more than entitled to free healthcare from our NHS. But has instead been lumbered with an enormous medical bill and left feeling anxious and fearful for his future. An absolutely despicable situation for anyone, but especially after you've laid your life on the line for the very country seeking to bill you nearly thirty thousand pounds.Thankfully, the people of this country have a great affinity for our veterans and we would love for you to contribute what you can so we can help out Taitusi and his family out of this mess. We are not confident the government will step in and help, so it is up to all of us to do what we can.Disclaimer: should there be an intervention no matter how unlikely, any funds raised will be donated to SSAFA – the Armed Forces charity, the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association, is a UK charity that provides lifelong support to serving men and women and veterans from the British Armed Forces and their families or dependants.Link to story as reported in The Guardian: https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/18/british-army-veteran-faces-27000-nhs-hospital-bill?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other&fbclid=IwAR103dpU-OxanFq0Oq_b6g2iXaYBEbb-omeVNt3iCpnmkMmRYXjbNsr2IIkRead more"

He is on a ventilator now after previously being treated for COVID at St. David’s Hospital.The medical bills are piling up after three different hospital stays (one he was moved to was out of network). His family was told he would likely need in-home care and rehabilitation too. Currently, he is fighting for his life on a ventilator and receiving dialysis. The family is allowed to see him once a week.Eanes is an incredibly supportive and caring community. We hope we can help ease this burden and love on this Eanes family. We appreciate any donations for the family, and his daughters request prayers from those who would like to pray for him. ‘Gofundme’ says to include the following information for full transparency. 100% of the money donated will be delivered to the family after Gofundme withdraws their 2.9% fee. The delivery will be by check, and photos of delivery will be posted here. I am Sarah Chen, and had worked with Albino for eight years as a kindergarten teacher. I live in Austin, Texas. The funds will be used to help Albino and his family pay for things such as medical bills, rehabilitation services, in-home care, doctor visits, and other bills that may be accrued since he has been unable to work while sick and will not be able to work until recovered. Mr. Hernandez is an amazingly kind and hardworking man. He always has a smile and greeting for each student. He works hard cleaning our school to keep it safe for the kids and staff; let’s help him too.

As a mother it hurts me to the core of my soul to see my My son Ziggy go from such a happy kid to being a very, very , very sick kid. Ziggy is Special needs and was also born with Prader-Willi Syndrome. On Dec. 27 Ziggy went to the hospital due to an infection possibly to the hardware in in back from the 2 spinal fusions he had a couple years ago, that caused him to have an emergency surgery to remove hardware and treat an infection. After surgery he was tested positive for Covid. Everything went down hill. I was torn to pieces. Prior to this Ziggy had not one symptom. He was the happiest kid ever. Upon being tested positive for Covid He was placed on a ventilator and put in somewhat of a induced Coma. While all of this was happening his back surgery was not complete. His back was still open just bandaged up because he was having to go to the operating room at least twice a week to have procedures done to his spine. Ziggy's lungs collapsed and he also has no movement in his legs. He was already in a wheel chair but could walk with a walker. Now he cant walk at all. He has had another surgery for a trach which he now has but still connected to a ventilator. He still has to go to TICU and then try to get to rehab. He can not come home until he has recovered, which could be months. Due to being on a trach that is still connected to a ventilator I will be unable to transport him back and forward to his doctor appointments, out patient rehab and possibly school I currently don't have the proper vehicle which is a to transport Ziggy. I am no longer able to lift him in my SUV due to my back issues and the trach being hooked to a home ventilator and tubing. Ziggy is in need of a Wheel Chair van and a new chair that will accommodate him and his home ventilator. I am a MOID Instructional Paraprofessional and between teaching everyday, (yes while my Ziggy is in ICU) teaching from his bedside sometimes, staying at the hospital over night and going back and forward to see about my 13 year old (his brother)I have a lot going on. I thank God everyday for my strength. My faith is at a all time high and I know that God has not brought us this far to leave us. Ziggy is my hero, I love him with all my heart and I know that he will get thru this cause it is all in Gods plan. Ziggy lost his father (my husband) back in 2015 and I promised him I would always be there for him no matter what. THE CORONA VIRUS IS REAL!!! WEARING A MASK IS IMPORTANT!!! NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS WOULD I HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD HAPPEN TO MY CHILD AND I TOOK ALL THE PRECAUTIONS TO KEEP HIS SAFE AND YET THE VIRUS FOUND HIM. I AM NOW AN ADVOCATE FOR WEARING MASK.

CRPS is a rare neurological disorder characterized by constant burning pain, changes to skin and bone, and decreased mobility among a myriad of other symptoms. It is also ranked as the most painful human condition according to the McGill pain scale. To me, a feather feels like a blow torch. This places it atop childbirth, cancer, and unprepared amputation.I would spend the next seven years in and out of complex pain services at B.C. Children's Hospital retraining my brain that the world should not hurt. While I have every textbook symptom of CRPS, I also present with unexplained paralysis. I re-learnt to walk twice during that time.In October, I had my third relapse. I was diagnosed with hemiplegia after losing complete movement of my left side.Instead of moving into a rehab facility, they sent me home. They told me nobody would touch my case and that I didn’t deserve the help as much as someone who had a spinal cord injury. All while telling me I was a burden on my community.When asked what I was supposed to do, they told me I just needed to try harder to move and offered me an antidepressant.Those doctors eventually dropped my case.I have been receiving community based physical therapy but have yet to see any improvements. At this point, I am unable to sit up on my own, tie my shoes, or hold cutlery.Independence has always been my end goal. A custom power chair will give me every opportunity to fulfil my potential. Throughout this year, my frustration has not been pointed at my body but instead the lack of institutional support and equipment that would allow me to continue living a full and meaningful life.Weighing roughly 70lbs the coincidentally named Bailey Built Wheelchair, is light and compact enough to easily fit on planes and into cars. For the first time since October, I would get to venture out of my house without assistance.This wheelchair would dramatically alter my quality of life but it costs roughly $11,000 out of pocket. People have asked how they can help and as much as it makes me uncomfortable to accept help, I need it. So if you feel inclined to help, it would mean a lot. Thank you.Read more"

CIDP is an autoimmune disorder which progressively destroys myelin, the protective covering of the nerves which control various parts of the body, most typically the arms and legs.Back in October, Todd began to experience tingling and numbness in his hands and feet which quickly worsened and expanded to his legs over a few weeks.  In December it had progressed to where Todd required a cane to walk and by January he needed a walker to navigate short distances. The disease continued to worsen while doctors scrambled to diagnose the cause and by the time a diagnosis was discovered, the CIDP progressed to where Todd now requires a wheelchair to travel any distance and he cannot navigate stairs without his family's considerable assistance. Although there is no cure for CIDP, Todd and his family remain positive and hopeful that a successful treatment solution will be found. He is currently undergoing an aggressive treatment plan involving monthly IVIG plasma and steroid infusions in the hope that the disease might be controlled as he undergoes daily physical and occupational therapy at Spaulding Rehab in Boston. Todd has been at Spaulding for weeks learning how to safely use the medical equipment that he will rely on for daily living and mobility once he's able to return home.  As we all know, Todd is determined, driven and laser focused on getting better and rebuilding strength. He continues to make us laugh even with all he is going through. The road ahead will be difficult for their family. His wife Melissa is an elementary school secretary and their two children, Ian and Ava are both high school juniors trying to navigate remote learning and make future plans for college. Todd has been out of work for 4 months now and Melissa is desperately trying to explore any means available to meet the daunting financial burdens facing the family. Without the steady income from Todd's employment and with a growing mountain of home and medical bills as a result of insurance coverage limitations, the totals far exceed the means to meet these obligations.  This GoFundMe account has been created by close friends in an effort to find others willing to help this great family in need.  Please consider assisting Todd and Melissa find the means to address the loss of income, mounting medical bills and the anticipated home alterations needed to meet Todd's mobility requirements before he can safely return home.Read more"

Unfortunately, the surgeon knew right away that the tumor was not benign but aggressive malignant grade 3 cancer.We were flabbergasted, he is a young and healthy man; why is he being tested at such a young age. Cancer was not an option,Danand his sweetfamily had their worldflipped upside down.Dan is currently in a rehab facility fighting to regain motor functions on the left side of his body. His journey will be long, he starts aggressive chemo and radiation therapy in a few short weeks, as soon as his body is strong enough for the treatment.

She spent from May 8th until September 28th alone in hospitals and rehab facilities as Covid prevented her husband Charlie and their children and grandchildren from seeing her. Mary was a teacher for over 40 years, teaching in local parochial grade schools in Delaware County, including 30 years at St. Gabriel's in Norwood. Mary's husband Charlie taught at Cardinal Dougherty, Archbishop Prendergast, then Monsignor Bonner/Archbishop Prendergast and Cardinal O'Hara along with moderating student activities and coaching youth and student athletes in various sports at the community and high school level, and also coaching softball at St. Joseph's University. Mary and Charlie have always been givers to the community and have touched the lives of many!Soon Mary's medical coverage for physical therapy will run out, and the in-home care assistance she requires is also not covered by any medical coverage. They should be enjoying retirement but instead they are exhausting their retirement savings to cover medical and home care expenses.Mary is making progress, but she will need physical therapy for most likely another year in order to regain the ability to walk and regain her independence. They simply do not have the funds to continue the treatments and care she will require. Mary will physically regress without continued physical therapy.We are simply asking you to rally around Mary, and HELP MARY TO WALK AGAIN!

It can effect gait, cause pain, and contribute to muscle contractures which can lead to deformities.Nerve fibres running from the muscles back to the spinal cord play a major role in maintaining the typical muscle stiffness seen in spasticity. SDR is a surgical procedure performed on these spinal nerve fibres to reducelevels of spasticity in the legs.SDR is currently not available in Ireland therefore America is the best place to go in order to give Sienna every opportunity to walk in the future.We would be extremely grateful of everyone's donation to help pay for the travel ,surgery and the rehab afterwards.ThanksLesley Anne and Ciarán.Read more"

Being diagnosed with an incurable illness (neurofibermatosis [NF]) as a child and dealing with the accompanied affects of this disease. Although challenging at times, she’s always managed to remain positive and rise above this disease. Kendra began experiencing severe symptoms; nausea, vomiting, migraines, numbness, and slurred speech in early 2021. After several months, Kendra sought out medical help. A CT was preformed and a tumour was discovered in the centre of her brain. As she faced surgery, she remained a positive and comforting force for those around her.Kendra left brain surgery with the same light she had entered with. She’s been handling this news with grace and dignity most of us could never imagine. On March 10, exactly one month from originally discovering the growth, her biopsy results returned with the worst predicted outcome; the growth is both cancerous and connected with her NF. Kendra is now confronted with 6 weeks of radiation in an attempt to kill the cancer, followed by a lengthy amount of rehab. This has forced her to leave her job, likely for at least a year, while continuing to pay for medical travel, student debt, and other monthly expenses we all have as adults. For those who haven’t had a chance to spend as much time with her personally, let me give you an insight to the kind of person she is. Kendra’s the kind of girl who has done everything right. She’s recently graduated with her third diploma, and has spent the past three years focusing on expecting to help others in the occupational therapy field. Kendra’s the type of girl who would be there for anyone in an instant, without a question. With her infectious laugh and witty sense of humour, she’s able to effortlessly pull people around her out of their shells. There is no amount too small, every donation will help this wonderful woman fight for her life and remain financially sound and ultimately as stress free as possible in this incredibly difficult time. Kendra appreciates everyone’s support throughout this trying timeThank you from the bottom of our hearts, Kendra’s support teamKendras brother Kyle Kidnie will be making sure the money raised is going where Kendra needs it to so she has one less worry.Read more"

I’m keeping in contact with his niece Nichole who is currently with him and we will work together to post updates here as they come. Yesterday (March 12th) Seth made the decision to be put on a ventilator to help him stabilize enough for surgery. This is why he can’t update us himself right now, but knowing Seth he will as soon as he is able and feeling up to it! In the meantime check in here for updates and share this with his friends.

Family/friends, I never really thought I’d ever get to a place where I would have to publicly ask for help. I pride myself on being a very strong individual who can take care of what needs to be done on my own, so I hope you’ll understand that this isn’t easy for me and I’ve put off asking for help as long as I can.Those who know me, know my animals are my everything. I work so hard so that they can have the life they deserve. Unfortunately, my sweet baby Rowan is in need of surgery, and with everything going on in the world right now, we are struggling to find the money to get him what he needs.Its come to the point where conservative management is only hurting him and we have no choice but to do bilateral ACL repairs sooner rather than later or we risk further damage to his meniscus and joint.

My sweet, lovable, crazy baby boy can no longer do the barn chores with me (his favorite thing in the world), he can’t play with his siblings, can’t stand without assistance, can’t go outside without being carried and placed, and he can’t even get into his bed and lie down due to how much pain he’s in and it’s killing me.

The amount we need listed is to cover his medical bills that we will accrue over the next 2-3 months that we will be rehabbing him after the surgery. I’ve taken the time to itemize exactly what he’s going to have done and with a price so that if anyone is able to help, they can see exactly where it’s being put to use. I just want my boy to be pain free again ❤️ Anything and everything helps, please know I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t my last option. We love you all and thank you immensely for your kindness ❤️

Love- Emily, Zachary and Rowan ❤️
