Recently a large tumor was found in the right side of her brain and she was in immediate need of medical attention. After many hours of surgery, they were only able to remove about 80% of it and it is currently unknown if it is a malignant tumor or not. Since the tumor has been discovered, there have been many hour-long drives to and from the hospital where Leah is being cared for and many sleepless nights. Depending on the results of the biopsy, there can possibly be much more to come including medical bills, transportation, meals, and time off from work. These funds will not only help the family's personal finances and Leah's long road to recovery but will also help with the emotional distress that they're currently experiencing. We welcome all prayers, support, and donations to help ease this family's pain.Nosotros, la familia González estamos creando este gofundme para nuestra sobrina de 8 meses, la bebé Leah Zoé, la hija de Yajaira y Felix, y la hermana pequeña de Misael, quien vive en Puerto Rico.

Después de muchas horas de cirugía, solo pudieron extirpar alrededor del 80% y actualmente se desconoce si es un tumor maligno o no. Desde que se descubrió el tumor, ha habido muchos viajes largos hacia y desde el hospital donde se cuida a Leah y muchas noches sin poder dormir. Dependiendo de los resultados de la biopsia, posiblemente haya mucho más por venir, incluidas facturas médicas, transporte, alimentos y tiempo libre del trabajo. Estos fondos no solo ayudarán a las finanzas personales de la familia y el largo camino de la recuperacion de Leah, pero tambien ayudaran con el sufrimiento emocional que estan experimemntando actualmente.Read more"

“Little by little, a little becomes a lot.”- Tanzanian ProverbKathy’s StoryFive years ago, Kathy took a chance and applied to become a paraprofessional. At the time, she had no idea what it entailed, she just knew from past experience that she wanted to make a difference in children’s lives. Little by little, Kathy learned tricks and techniques to add to her toolbox and she became a seasoned and highly dedicated paraprofessional. Kathy used this experience to continue growing her career and recently accepted a new position as a Latchkey Site Director.On Tuesday, January 26th, Kathy’s world quickly changed. While working at latchkey, Kathy suddenly lost feeling and control of her arms and legs. She was rushed to the ER where she underwent countless tests. Kathy was told by doctors that there are lesions on her spinal cord caused by influenza. She was diagnosed with Transverse Myelitis. While there is no cure for Transverse Myelitis, doctors are treating Kathy’s symptoms with steroids and muscle relaxers. Kathy was unable to move anything below her neck, but after a few days with her first round of steroids, she’s already able to lift her right arm up and sit up for brief periods of time with support. Little by little, Kathy’s improvements will hopefully become a LOT of progress that will lead to a full recovery!


Where YOU come in...In the meantime, Kathy will be unable to work or support herself. Doctors anticipate rehab could take up to 5 months and will likely happen out state. Kathy needs to be able to put her full focus on healing and growing stronger, so this fundraiser is aiming to pay for her health insurance deductible and out-of-pocket costs. Any additional funds will go towards lost wages not covered by leave.If you would like to help ease Kathy’s financial burden, any donations (even $1) would be greatly appreciated! You can also share her story and fundraiser to help spread the word! Little by little, YOUR donations will add up to be a HUGE relief for Kathy!We hope you will consider become a #KathysCrusaders today! ❤️




UPDATE ON 2-19-21:

We are so amazed by and thankful for everyone’s support. ❤️ Our original $9,000 goal to cover Kathy’s insurance deductible and out-of-pocket expenses was met in just 12 days!  After having learned more about Kathy’s condition, it is apparent that her road to recovery is going to be long and arduous. She has already made some great progress and has been able to use some adapted tools to begin relearning how to feed herself and sit/stand with support for brief amounts of time. The hospital team is working to get her placed in an out-of-state rehab facility that specializes in spinal cord injuries, but the approval and admissions process are lengthy. It is anticipated that Kathy will be at Wesley hospital through at least March 1st and then possibly another 5 weeks while she waits for admission. She may have to be placed temporarily in a local rehab facility while she awaits transfer out of state. Kathy will be unable to work through at least the end of the school year, so she is going to need financial support to cover her monthly bills through this difficult time. She anticipates her monthly bills to be around $705, so we have calculated and are raising our GoFundMe goal to $12,525 cover the next 5 months of her expenses.



Little by little, YOUR donations added up to meet and SURPASS Kathy’s first goal! We are hopeful we can rally again to meet her next goal!If you would like to help ease Kathy’s financial burden, any donations (even $1) would be greatly appreciated! You can also share her story and fundraiser to help spread the word! Little by little, WE can get Kathy the support she needs to be able to focus on making a full recovery!

He was born healthy and strong, however, a few weeks after birth, Rigel’s health began to decline rapidly, and he was rushed to the hospital after he became unresponsive. After a terrifying ordeal of tests, scans, blood transfusions, and IVs, it was discovered that Rigel had suffered a brain hemorrhage that had affected approximately 80% of his brain. Additionally, he suffered a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and epilepsy, due to the inflammation in his brain.Thanks to the medical team and Laura’s vigilance, the bleeding and inflammation in Rigel’s brain was controlled in time and he is now at back at home -- healing, growing, and recovering his strength. Despite his amazing recovery, baby Rigel still needs continued treatment for his epilepsy, frequent monitoring to assess the potential damage caused by the hemorrhage, and therapy to help prevent any cognitive/physical delays.Laura, Luis, and Rigel live in Los Organos, Peru, which is a small town with very limited medical services. The closest hospital where Rigel can receive exams and treatment is 3 hours away in the city of Piura. Complicating the situation, Peru continues to be on a national lockdown, meaning there is no public transportation and Laura must hire a private driver to make the trip to Piura for medical appointments. The lockdown has also made it impossible for Laura and Luis to work and they are currently living on a very limited budget.Our goal is to raise sufficient funds to provide Rigel with 4-5 months of medical treatment and therapy so that Laura and Luis can focus all of their energy on helping him recovery fully.Rigel’s monthly medical costsPrivate transport from Los Organos/Piura round trip-- $130 (400 soles)Encephalogram $100 (300 soles)Overnight stay in Peru $30 (100 soles)Anti seizure medication $70 (200 soles)Other medications, vitamins, probiotics $70 (200 soles)Physical therapy - $30 per session, recommended weeklyAppointments with various specialists (optomologists, pediatric nuerologists, etc.) as neededScans and exams (abdominal ultrasounds, blood tests, encephalograms, MRI, etc.) as neededBaby Rigel is tiny warrior-- in only a few months of life, he's already survived a traumatic brain injury and continues to surprise the doctors with his strength and resiliency! We have no doubt that with continued medical treatment (and lots of love!) this sweet little soul will make a full recovery and live a full, incredible, beautiful life. We graciously ask for your support in helping Rigel get the treatment and therapy he needs and in giving Laura and Luis peace of mind, knowing that their angel will be cared for, even during these difficult times.Read more"

We want to say a massive thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the love and blessings we have received. Due to the super effort from Family and friends and your amazing donations we have now raised together the 25 thousand pounds needed to pay for Jaya’s wonderful wheelchair. The extra money that will now be donated will go towards private physiotherapy for Jaya’s recent major spinal operation recovery and specialist Equiptment that she needs. Thank you all for your amazing and generous donations. Xx

Please help Jaya to be able to pay the extra amount needed for this amazing standing wheelchair which she desperately needs. We have managed to get together part of it, we just need to raise the last amount to buy the chair.Independence is something Jaya has compromised on with poor mobility. Standing wheelchairs can facilitate some new positions and activities that wouldn't be possible like having a face to face conversation with her friends, family and teachersThere are so many physical benefits that this chair will bring to Jaya: it will help with her breathing function since Jaya has had frequent chest infections in the past, and because being in a seated position. This means that In a standing position her breathing becomes less exhausting. Jaya has had spinal problems and this will help strengthen her spine taking the pressure of her back. Improvement of boodflow which will help oxygen circulate around her body Jayas legs and feet tend to get pale and have reduced bloodflow and improve circulation in lower limbs and reduce the risk of thrombosis.Jaya had chron's disease and standing and changes of position and posture will significantly enhance bladder & bowel function. Standing reduces the risk of infections, being able to extend the trunk will make the whole system function more efficiently and regularly. Jaya has reduces bone density due to a lot of sitting and low leg movement so her bones will get stronger and moving her positions will act as exercise and physiotherapy. Jaya has had her coccyx removed due to pressure sore that had eaten into her bone. This will be eliminated if Jaya is able to move her positioning on a regular basis and her blood flow can circulate. Her sapcticty can get quite severe and this will help her to loosen her limbs and stretch her muscles independently throughout the day.All in all, this will totally change Jayas way of life giving her so much more of a better and easier lifestyle. also independence and a better chance of achieving more physical tasks and feeling more included.

When Dustin was a toddler he was diagnosed with Neuroblastoma and receivedlife-saving Cancer treatment that unknowinglycaused extreme damage to his heart. He learned as a young adult back in 2014, that he has acute on chronic combined systolic/diastolic congestive heart failure, and has suffered a heart attack at only the age of 30. Duringthis point of his life he was not a candidatefor a transplant due to a variety of factors. Dustin took that life-altering news and buckled down making HUGE life changes in order to get healthy, including losing 80 pounds. It seemed that his heart was getting stronger, and all was going great until he woke up Christmas day feeling weak and sick. He was soon admitted into the hospital with low blood pressure, low Potassium and fluid accumulation around his heart and in his lungs. After some tests were run Dustin’s cardiologist told him that his heart function had declined rapidly in a short period of time and it looked like he could have just a few weeks/months left of life with his heart diagnosis.Luckily Dustin has people who love him dearly, and he has a plan in process! He will be meeting with the University of Iowa heart failure/ transplant team this week, but he needs our help. One of the requirements to even be placed on the transplant list is a secure financial plan for post-transplant care which includes anti-rejection meds, PT/OT and home care. Depending on the course of action the team decides to take he could have a bridge LVAD surgery which would require him to have extra expenses and equipment. At the very least he will encounter deductibles, copays, and other incidentals. He will also need transportation and living expenses.Dustin is a father to THREE beautiful children, Dominick (11), Ryder (9)and Aubrey(1) who need him so much. He is a son, a brother, an Uncle, a grandson, a nephew, a cousin and a friend to so many. He is a baseball coach, and always gives so much for the boys on his team. He is hilarious, fun, caring, loving, passionate and so strong. He has already conquered so much in his life, but we all need him here a lot longer. Dustin is going to need our help to make it through this, and our generosity can ease many extra hardships during this time.


Although he needs a new heart, he has always and will always have a heart of pure gold Let's all rally and get Dustin a new heart!!!#TeamBachman

Basheer was rushed to Fairview Southdale then transferred to HCMC where he stayed in a non-medically induced coma in the ICU for 23 days. He was on a ventilator unable to breathe for himself. Basheer's situation was very severe and left him with traumatic brain injuries. It was unknown how bad Basheer's injuries were in the first few days in the ICU, but doctors indeed knew that Basheer had severe injuries to his brain, which could lead to so many unknowns for his future. We did not know how long it was going to take Basheer to wake up, or if he was going to wake up at all - which of course left his family and friends terribly worried. Basheer is a brother, son, and joyful 16 year old junior at Prior Lake High School, who has high hopes for his future. He loves spending time with his friends, laughing, and playing his favorite sport, basketball.February 3rd, 2021: Basheer's situation was unchanged. His condition had not worsened, but he was still in a non-medically induced coma after 2 weeks in the ICU at HCMC. All his loved ones were so distraught and no one knew if or when Basheer would indeed wake up. Basheer was treated with so much love and care at HCMC, which was bringing comfort to all. His mother, who never left his bedside, was hearing so much concerning news about Basheer’s condition multiple times each day, but she had never given up on her son waking up and fighting. All of Basheer’s family, friends, and teachers continued to hope and pray for him to wake up and return to our world in any way possible.February 11th, 2021: Basheer began giving all his loved ones glimmers of hope as nurses urged him to open his eyes and provide responses to questions asked to him such as “Basheer, can you hear us? Can you open your eyes for us, Basheer? Squeeze my hand if you can hear me, Basheer!” Prayers were answered when Basheer bagan showing more of these types of responses every day. It went from opening his eyes, to lifting his head and turning his neck, moving his arms and legs, to trying to speak, and a few days later, even being taken off his breathing tube. This was amazing news for Basheer and some of his first steps towards real recovery! Within a few more days, Basheer began to become fully awake, aware of his surroundings and current situation. His chances were genuinely a miracle! Basheer stayed in the ICU for about another when he was later transferred to Gillette's Children Hospital.Now: Basheer has been improving each day and began rehab at Gillette’s. His mother and family, who have been with him constantly, have received so much love and support from all who care about Basheer. He has been working with a wonderful team of dedicated therapists, doctors, and nurses. On March 9th, Basheer’s feeding tube was finally removed and he began eating on his own. His story is truly a miracle, but it is not over yet. Basheer’s medical team are working diligently, but believe he will need to stay in the hospital at least until late spring 2021. Basheer has made so much progress working very hard to regain his strength again, but he and his family have a long road to full recovery ahead. It is with any donations here that the family will be able to support Basheer’s recovery and their household needs that have been strained since the accident.We thank you for considering donating to help support Basheer and his family!Read more"

He is currently in the ICU at Loyola Medical Center in Chicago where he is fighting for his life. Jeff's horrible journey began on Jan. 14 when he was taken by ambulance to Glen Oaks Hospital where he was treated for Covid Pneumonia. His breathing continued to decline, and it was decided that he be transferred to Loyola where they could provide more support. By Jan 28 there was still no improvement and the ICU team decided the best option was for Jeff to be sedated and placed on a ventilator. His family prayed this would help him with his recovery, but after a week, his health continued to decline where his blood became acidotic. On Feb 6, Jeff needed more support and was placed on an ECMO machine. At the present time, he continues to be sedated in the ICU and is being assisted with both the ventilator and ECMO support. Kathy is currently in the process of arranging a transfer to the University of Chicago Hospital in the hopes he will be a potential candidate for a lung transplant.

He is already showing progress with the courage and determination he brings to every challenge life throws his way. He has been able to make some small movements with his arms, indicating that the injury to his spinal cord is ""incomplete"". This is a hopeful sign that he'll be able to make some sort of recovery.Today (2/20) is Gary's 8th day in the ICU, where he is breathing with the on-and-off assistance of a ventilator. Because of COVID-19, there is no visitation allowed for friends, and Dayna has very limited access, so Gary is having to go through this horrendous ordeal virtually alone.Once he is ready to be transitioned out of the ICU, he will head to Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center to begin his long road of recovery.

The cost of current and future medical care and equipment is going to be enormous, and insurance will not cover everything. The Coleman family has not asked for any donations, but we hope that providing some monetary support through this fundraiser will help them with the unforeseen costs of long-term rehabilitation, as well as any potential renovations they will need to enable Gary's comfortable return home.We're also asking for your support, prayers, well wishes, and positive energy to help Gary and his family meet the challenges ahead.

My beard – I have been growing that for a long time, it goes up and down depending on my mood and some other external factors.This August marks 20 years since I was diagnosed with a brain tumour at the age of 16. After 2-3 years of vomiting, headaches and vision problems I was diagnosed with pilocytic astrocytoma. This is a benign brain tumour that arises from astrocytes (the supportive cells in the nervous system). These slow-growing tumours usually occur in children and are considered to be the most benign type of astrocytoma. Once I was diagnosed, surgery was immediate. Diagnosed on Wednesday, Surgery to following Tuesday at the Royal Childrens Hospital, a trulty amazing place.After the long 9-hour surgery, I was tumour free and on the road to recovery. I had a very lucky diagnosis, and a very lucky outcome. Over the next 20 years I have been equally lucky to have become a husband, a dad to 2 gorgeous girls, played a role in our family business and lived a full lifeThe brain tumour hasn’t had much of an impact on my life, very little if any. As a said – I am very lucky – sadly, most people diagnosed with brain tumours are not. This is why, to celebrate the 20 years since my experience, I will be shaving my head, and face in order to raise some money to try and help people with a not so lucky diagnosis. I will be shaving my head to a number 1 – which will be interesting seeing that I have 1 10-12 cm scar running down the back of my head and neck! My face hasn’t seen the light of day for over 6 years.The organisation we will be donating all proceeds to is Cure Brain Cancer Australia. We would LOVE your support in donating to this cause. The donations will help their mission to increase five-year survival from the current 20% to 50% by 2023 by funding vital research for both adults and children. Around 1700 people are diagnosed with brain cancer in Australia annually and approximately 1200 die from the disease every year. Brain cancer kills more children in Australia than any other disease and more people under 40 than any other cancer.Brain cancer costs more per person than any other cancer because it is highly debilitating, affects people in their prime and often means family members cannot work if they become carers. For those aged 35–44, brain cancer accounted for the highest proportion of cancer expenditure, totalling $32 million.The Brave Dave Shave will be held on a livestream video on Saturday the 29th of August at 2pm. Please come and join in on the fun! We would love everyone’s support during the event. If you can donate some money to this cause – even better.Read more"

Dave was 49 years old and leaves behind a wife, three children (ages 30, 21, and 10), a sister, his parents, and many friends whom have become family over the years.For over the past two years the Capehart family has fought this cancer with everything they have, all while having relentless faith and optimism. If you know Dave and his family, you know this to be the absolute truth. Even when Dave was diagnosed with Covid-19, he never stopped fighting and eventually beat Covid-19.Dave dedicated over half his life to our community with more than 20 years as an EMT, Dispatcher, Reserve Officer, and, most recently, serving as a 911 Director. When he wasn't doing one of those many jobs he was part of the Labor Union and working at OFS in Huntingburg. Dave has always been known for his compassion for people, especially those with special needs. It is this rare quality that made Dave such an asset to the community and that he came to be known as, per his wife, ""The Best Dave Ever"".Dave's wife, Leah, works in the Prosecutor's Office in Petersburg and has always been a source of encouragement and happiness to everyone she comes into contact with. At home with Leah is their 10 year old son. Their 21 year old daughter is a few hours away at college. Over the course of the past two years frequent doctor visits, both near and far, have been a constant; along with many scheduled operations and recoveries that not only take a mental toll, but also a financial one. On March 16, 2021, Dave lost his battle to cancer, but many of the family's battles are just beginning as they process to a new and heartbreaking normal, and transition to being a one-income household. The Capehart's will be the first to count their many blessings and ensure others that they are fine. However, there are many unforeseen costs and needs that will present themselves as they deal with the loss of Dave. The dedication Dave has given to his community through his years of service will forever be remembered and appreciated. Now, it is our turn to take care of Dave's family during this incredibly difficult time and follow his incredible example of service.Any donation - no matter the amount - I know is immensely appreciated by Dave's family and friends.

On the morning of Friday, March 12 our friend Tania, a loving wife to Carlos and most importantly a wonderful mother to Isabella, suffered a brain hemorrhage resulting in an emergency brain surgery. Tania remains unconscious following surgery and is still in recovery.She has unmatched strength, and her commitment to those in her life and everything she does is the reason we feel the need to step up to ensure that same compassion and kindness is returned to someone so very deserving. During this unfortunate time, Tania and her immediate family are distanced from loved ones who are unable to travel because of COVID19 restrictions. Tania has been a good friend and a mentor to us, and we consider her to be like a big sister; always looking out for us, providing guidance and incomparable advice…she has shown us love and support when we needed it as well. While Tania faces healing and recovery, we want to ensure that she, Carlos, and Isabella are supported and have access to everything they may need. From a small meal to one less medical bill, we hope our contributions can make a change and leave them with one less worry.Many people have reached out asking what they can do to help. Whether you are a friend, a family member, a co-worker, or maybe someone who has just simply been affected by Tania’s story, we appreciate any donation you can make to ensure Tania’s journey to recovery is free of worry for both her and her family. This page will remain open, and we encourage you to come back from time to time to continue to make any contributions. Thank you.

Tania permanece inconsciente y sigue en un lento proceso de recuperación.Su talante de madre, fortaleza de esposa y compromiso incondicional con familia y amigos nos ha inspirado a lo largo de nuestras vidas. Es por ello que en este momento de vulnerabilidad sentimos la necesidad de dar un paso al frente para asegurar que la misma compasión y bondad inconmensurable le sean retribuidas de alguna manera. En medio de esta situación tan amarga, su familia más cercana y sus seres queridos no han logrado viajar a acompañar y brindar apoyo emocional a su esposo e hija debido a las restricciones impuestas como consecuencia de la pandemia causada por la COVID-19. Tania ha sido una buena amiga y mentora para nosotros, la consideramos como una hermana mayor; siempre cuidándonos, compartiendo su amistad y brindándonos sus consejos incomparables… Tania nos ha demostrado cariño, generosidad, y apoyo cuando lo hemos necesitado y es el momento de devolver el gesto.

Several of numerous titles bestowed upon one of the most hard-working, strong, and resilient men I know. Unfortunately, on Wednesday March 10th, Keenan was doing what he always does, spending quality time with his kids and playing a friendly, competitive game of cornhole, when he collapsed suddenly. As he laid unresponsive, the ambulance arrived and he was rushed to the hospital where, some time later, doctors discovered from a CT scan that he had a blood clot in his head. Keenan had experienced a stroke at the young age of 36. Surgery was inevitable to remove the blood clot from his head. As a result of the stroke, he has lost his ability to speak, and also lost the use of his right side. As he lay in the hospital bed surrounded by family, he remains in good spirits, knowing he has the full support of his family, colleagues, students, and friends. However, the battle to recover does not end here. After further tests by doctors, it was also discovered that Keenan also has a hole in his heart. Sometime in the near future, he will also have to have surgery to repair it as well. We ask of anyone that would like to further assist, any donation through GoFundMe we will be extremely thankful for. All funds raised will go directly to any medical costs and/or rehabilitation that Keenan will need on his road to recovery. The outpouring of love, prayers, and support shown after this unfortunate occurrence has undoubtedly been felt and very much appreciated, and will continue to be in the weeks and months to come.

Nuestra mamá y abuela, Beatriz-Venezolana de 78 años, NECESITA DE SU AYUDA. Luego de presentar fuerte dolor en su tórax, Betty fue diagnosticada con una cardiopatía valvular aortica: estenosis critica. Después de ser evaluada por el cardiólogo se llegó a la conclusión de que debe practicarse una cirugía para la sustitución de la válvula aortica de su corazón. Las membranas de esta válvula están llenas de puntos de calcio, volviéndolas rígidas e impidiendo el flujo necesario de sangre para los pulmones, cerebro y el resto del cuerpo. Yo, Carlos Maggiolo, su hijo, escribo esto en representación de mi familia. Vivo aquí en los Estados Unidos y el resto de mi familia viven en mi querida Venezuela. Mi país ha sido económicamente destruido. ¡El venezolano común gana menos de $3.00 americanos mensuales! Por esta razón, y que dada la situación del país, los adultos mayores quedaron desamparados sin sus pólizas de salud. Luego de desaparecer esta opción en Venezuela y debido a la edad de mi mama y condición medica no tuvo alternativa y la cirugía resulta imposible de pagar. La cirugía no se puede hacer en Mérida, ciudad donde reside, solo en Caracas. Hay que trasladarse a Caracas para la primera consulta con el cirujano y luego nuevamente para la cirugía. Traslado, consulta, cirugía, estadía en Caracas durante su recuperación y medicamentos rodea los $26,000. Nada es fácil en Venezuela, pero con la ayuda de todos la carga se alivia enormemente y se que lo lograremos. Mi mamá siempre se ha caracterizado por su generosidad con el prójimo. Tengo muchos recuerdos de cuando conocidos de mi mamá no dudaban en visitar la casa por alguna necesidad y mi mamá siempre estaba dispuesta a colaborar. Siempre lo ha hecho. Ahora que nos necesita quiero pedir una mano amiga para recompensar su bondad. Nos toca a nosotros. La madre es lo mas grande que uno tiene y la mía no es la excepción. Su primera cita es el 16 marzo y necesita la cirugía LO MAS PRONTO POSIBLE. Confiamos en Dios poder recoger los recursos necesarios para que el corazón de Beatriz De Jongh de Maggiolo, mi mamá, siga latiendo. Estaremos eternamente agradecidos con todo aquel que pueda hacer algo por mi mamá.                                  **IN ENGLISH**We are the Maggiolo De Jongh family. Our mother and grandmother, Beatriz-78 year old Venezuelan, NEEDS YOUR HELP. After experiencing a strong pain in her thorax, Betty was diagnosed with aortic valve heart disease: critical stenosis. After being evaluated by the cardiologist it was determined that she would need surgery to replace the aortic valve of her heart. The membranes of this valve are filled with calcium deposits, making them rigid and preventing the necessary flow of blood to the lungs, brain and the rest of the body. I, Carlos Maggiolo, her son am writing this on behalf of my family. I live here in the United States and the rest of my family is in my beloved Venezuela. My country has been destroyed economically. The average Venezuelan earns less than $3.00 a month! For this reason, and given the situation in the country, older adults were left helpless without their health policies. After this option disappeared in Venezuela and due to my mother's age and medical condition, she has no alternative, and the surgery is impossible to pay for. The surgery is not available in Mérida where she lives. It is only available in Caracas. They have to travel to Caracas for the first consultation and then again for the surgery. Travel, consultation, surgery, stay in Caracas during her recovery and medications add up to around $26,000. Nothing is easy in Venezuela but with everyone’s help the burden is greatly relieved and I know we will accomplish it. My mother has always been known for her generosity towards others. I have many memories of friends or family stopping by for various needs and my mom was always willing to help. She always has. Now that she needs us, I want to ask for a helping hand to reward your kindness. Now it is our turn. A mother is the greatest gift one can have and mine is not the exception. Her first appointment is March 16th, and she needs to have the surgery AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. We trust in God that we will be able to raise the necessary funds so that Beatriz De Jongh Maggiolo’s heart, my mom, may continue beating. We will be eternally grateful to anyone who can help to keep my mother with us.Read more"

Running a small business is hard enough during a pandemic, but brain cancer at the same time is truly difficult. Also there are mounting medical bills until a significant deductible is met. We have created this page with his permission and deep gratitude in the hope that we, along with many others, can help ease the financial burden for him in the weeks and months ahead.Ignatius was diagnosed with a primary brain tumor in March of 2018. He had surgery to remove the mass, radiation and chemotherapy followed. His recovery time was long but he did amazingly well and the business kept growing through online sales. He was in remission for over 2 years when he found out a tumor had returned. Again he had surgery and his doctors are doing more chemotherapy and want to get him into a clinical trial at Duke or Johns Hopkins. He will have a tough road ahead but is still making hats and coming up with new ideas. His amazing spirit and passion for hat making are what keep him motivated. What he needs more than anything right now is the time to focus on recovery.Starting in 1985, it has been a dream for Ignatius to have a successful hat making business. His dedication to this idea has been boundless and he developed a strong work ethic to achieve that goal. However, the recent arrival of COVID and Cancer slowed that dream and bruised his spirit. Right before the pandemic a store/workshop was purchased. The store never had the chance to fully open.Selling at small art shows soon advanced to exhibiting at the top shows in the nation including Smithsonian Craft Show and Philadelphia Museum of Art Craft Show. In these 36 years of business Ignatius hats have been used in movies, theater, opera, fashion shows, and museums and galleries. The work now has an online presence that is available to even more people.We are now reaching out to you asking for your help. No gift is too small and we thank you so very much for your support.Thank you!Rod Givens, spouse and power of attorney, will execute all donation proceeds to go towards Ignatius' care, expense and well being.Read more"

She was admitted to the hospital for exploratory surgery and they discovered a very rare infection (Descending Necrotizing Mediastinitis or DNM) which resulted in septic shock. After surgery, Julie was brought to The SICU (Surgical Intensive Care Unit), administered the strongest antibiotics, put under sedation, a ventilator, and dialysis. There was nothing Julie’s family and friends could do but pray and wait on what was described as “a poor prognosis”. She was fighting for her life.On December 26, we received good news that Julie had turned a corner! All of her numbers increased positively, her body was coming out of shock, and she was initiating breathing on her own. She’s still not out of the woods, but it’s extremely hopeful news.That was three days ago and the daily reports continue to be slow and steady. She remains in the SICU on a ventilator and dialysis. Julie’s hospitalization is estimated to last at least two months. There have been so many prayers, well wishes, and good vibes from all her friends ~ near and far ~ Thank you!

UPDATED March 25th where it says TODAY, before “Who is Sami” section.



WHAT HAPPENED:



There are no words to describe what happened on Thursday February 19, 2021, but I will do my best.











Our dear friend Sami Selo Ahmed was driving from Maryland to Virginia on highway 495. Unfortunately his car hit a patch of black ice and he crashed into the cement divider between the highway and the exit. Despite his windshield cracking and both airbags going off, Sami wasn’t hurt.











He called 911 and he was told they were gonna be on their way to help him. He called me right after and sent me his location so I could go pick him up. As we were on the phone he told me that he was witnessing a 3 car accident happening exactly where he had his. A few seconds later the phone call went silent. I stayed on the line for what felt like an eternity, but was about 40 minutes while I was on my way to where he was.











I heard cries, sirens and a police officer say that it appeared that Sami had been hit by one of the cars in that accident. I also heard the sound of an ambulance and heard he was being transported to a nearby hospital.











Once I found out where he was taken, I picked up Sami’s mother to take her there. Upon arrival we found out that he was undergoing emergency brain surgery because he had cracks in his skull and there was internal bleeding. Doctors had to open his head to release blood. He also had very low blood pressure and almost no pulse. We were told to prepare ourselves for the worst outcome as his chances of surviving the surgery were slim to none.











Being the fighter he is, Sami survived surgery and he was somewhat stabilized. But now the fight to stay stable began. Doctors told us that it had been a miracle to survive the surgery and his chances were very low to make it to the next day. He was then transferred to the ICU; due to COVID, trauma patients are not permitted visitors, however, due to the extenuating circumstances, they have allowed his mother, uncle and one more family member to be with him.











When he heard his mother’s voice, Sami’s eyes started to tear up. We are hoping he can hear us. With much love and prayer, he survived the night.











Friday, February 19, 2021:



Sami’s vitals had been stabilized with the exception of his blood pressure. The Doctors suggested that he undergoes a second brain surgery so he could be stable enough to run more tests and be able to provide him with the best treatment possible.











After his mom agreed to the surgery, our friend Sami went into the OR ready to fight for his life. After almost 2 hours, he successfully came out of his second brain surgery. Now the doctors are able to run some more tests because he is more stable than before. But the fight is nowhere near done.











Saturday February 20, 2021:



Today has been a better day so far . During yesterday’s CT Scan the nurses noticed that Sami was trying to breath on his own. So today, Saturday, the doctors decided to try and let him breath on his own, but still keep him connected just in case he needed help. He has been breathing on his own so far, but they have said that they want to keep monitoring his breathing for 24 hrs to make sure it’s stable. In the afternoon he was taken to get an MRI done. This is to check if there’s any damage to his neck. The results of the MRI hopefully will be given tomorrow. Today has been a great day, he is making progress  And that’s what we need him to do every day. Please continue to pray for him ❤️










Monday February 22,2021:



Yesterday the doctors got the results of the MRI test and saw that his neck is ok . These are great news. We have been explained that the road to find exactly what’s wrong it’s long and very delicate. We know his swelling is coming down and he continues to fight ❤️ Let’s keep praying and sending all the healing energy and good vibes.







FEBRUARY 25, 2021:



In the past few days Sami has been resting due to everything he’s been through. Tomorrow is gonna be a very important day for him. He’s strong and he continues to get better  Keep your prayers up please ❤️







MARCH 2, 2021:



Doctors have slowly starting to let some medicine and anesthesia wear off. Yesterday SAMI opened his eyes for a little bit . The progress is coming and his vitals are getting stronger everyday. Some days are more difficult than others but he is moving forward. Doctors are checking him constantly and they are happy with the small positives results they are seeing. Please keep thinking about him and remember him smiling and always helping someone because that’s how Sami is 






MARCH 5th, 2021:

It has been 2 weeks since the terrible accident. And it seems like all our positive energy and healing power have been working a little. His mother was talking to him yesterday when he had opened his eyes a little. And SAMI, in Sami’s fashion, gifted her with a smile. This smile means so much more than what we are used to. Regardless of his condition he is managing to give a little hope to his mother and to all of us. Doctors are hoping that with more rest more small steps will come. Please continue to have him in your thoughts and prayers.





TODAY MARCH 25, 2021:

In the past 20 days there has been some progress  SAMI has opened his eyes and seems like he can hear ❤️ His mom talks to him everyday and he blinks and sometimes moves his hand. Even though the most dangerous part of the recovery is behind him. The road to recovery is a very long one. Thank you for all your energy, prayers and thoughts. We need to continue having him in our thoughts 




WHO IS SAMI:



Sami Selo Ahmed is someone who most of us know from different periods in his life. From IT work, to Capoeira, to dance, DJing and organizing - Sami is someone who can truly do it all. Regardless of when and where you met Sami, our connections to him tend to be lifelong. We all know Sami as an incredibly loving and caring human being who would never ask anyone for help yet would always give 200% of his time and energy for anyone, regardless of how long he knew you.











As is to be expected, his mother is devastated and is in no position to worry about everything that comes with accidents, hospitals and emergency surgeries. The doctors told us that if Sami were to win this battle and survive, his recovery time is uncertain. It could take weeks, months, years or even his entire life.











We are asking those who have ever come into contact with him, if you’ve ever shared a dance with him, rehearsed with him, taken one of his classes, listened to him DJ, practiced Capoeira with him, shared a meal, went to school, attended DC Zouk, Sensual Day, or any of his events and/or exchanged conversation with him, to please help his mother take care of him.











Like Sami would say: “Obrigado Irmao” which means “Thank you brother” because to him everyone he came in contact with became family. Let’s pray and give all of our positive energy so that Sami , our family, our brother, can come out of this











I will continue to keep updating this post with more news.

Four years ago, my partner and Irish musician, Alan Kelly, was diagnosed with a rare kidney disease called focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). With no certain cure or known cause,so began three long years of trial and terror treatments. Unfortunately, nothing was successful and roughly one year ago, his kidney function deteriorated so much that he had to begin 4 hours of dialysis 3 times a week and wait an estimated 4 years for a kidney transplant. This unfortunately meant, for the first time in over 20 years, he would no longer be able to tour and perform internationally, except for a few select one off performances where he was able to organise dialysis abroad.Today, Alan's brother John, also a renowned Irish musician, has donated one of his kidneys to Alan so that he may have a better chance at life and shorten the long and tedious wait for a deceased kidney donor. It is truly one of the greatest gifts a human being can give. We are humbled and so grateful for his generosity. Both lads are out of surgery and doing well.Because of Covid-19, John has had to take unpaid time off work to cocoon for 2 weeks prior to the surgery to ensure he would be Covid free. In addition, he will need a further 8 weeks post surgery to fully recover before he can return to any form of work. There is minimal government support offered to him for these 10 weeks. Despite it leaving him financially burdened, especially before Christmas, this has never stopped him from considering going ahead with the transplant.For Alan, his recovery is more uncertain and he will need to take one day at a time. Post transplant leaves him in the utmost vulnerable category for Covid-19 and so he will need to continue cocooning for many months to come.Any funds raised will be split and are intended to help cover the loss of income from theinability to work during this time. It is also to offer alittle breathing space so that neither feels pressured to return to work too soon or is forced into vulnerable situations because of financial pressures.

Neither John or Alan are aware I’m doing this... I hope it will be a welcome surprise! It Is a small way to say thank you to John for his kindness and bravery. It is a tough time for so many, so please just send your good wishes if you don’t have anything to spare right now. Any amountis gratefully appreciated as are your thoughts and good wishes.

Thank you, Steph

If you know Mick and Harriet Amicone, you know that they are GOD and family first. You also know that if you are a member of their gym or on any of the sports teams that come through the building, you BECOME their FAMILY. They have constantly been a source of support to our entire community. Always there to help with a job, fundraisers when times are tough or fighting health battles, a place for recovery after a health battle, a shoulder to lean on, and always available for a prayer. They do this with zero expectations, just always answering that call to service. Always working hard for themselves, their children, and their community. Over the past few years, the Amicones have been quietly fighting their own battle. Mick has been in and out of treatment for cancer since 2018. This time, his body needs a break from the chemo. That gives us functional medicine, new supplements, and new course of treatments to try, all which are covered very little, if at all, by insurance. 3 months of treatments, supplements, and Gerson Therapy will cost almost $48,000. That’s not including any cost of treatment over the past few years. This is just for the next three months. We’re trying to help lessen this huge financial burden in anyway we can. Our initial goal is $10,000. That will cover the big upfront beginning cost of treatments and supplements. If you can help in anyway, please do so. Every single penny helps. Please share!Money raised through the gofundme (and any cash/Venmo donations) will be put in to the Mick Amicone Benefit Fund at Park National Bank. Some of the therapies and treatments these funds will cover are:-Redlight/NIR therapy-Ionization Detoxification System-Alkaline System/Ionizer Water System-Infared NIR Sauna + Aromatherapy -Acupuncture Mat -Heart Rate Variability & Brain Tap System -Supplementation + Anti-Inflam Meal Plan -Cold Press Juice-Gerson Therapy- doc appointmentsand so much more.

ALSO- Mick and Harriet have no idea that this gofundme has been started. So, please write Words of Encouragement when you make your donation, BUT please don’t (yet) mention this to either of them. We are trying to keep them from stopping our help. All money will be put in Dr. Katelyne’s care as she is in contact with Mick’s doctor and working together on his functional medicine treatment plan.

I write this with a heavy heart and tears in my eyes as it seems so surreal at times. Above anything we ask for a chain of prayers.The entire month of February 2021 has reached so many levels of uncertainty. Chrissy began having seizures that ended up resulting in multiple emergency room visits and neurology screenings. She was not responding to any of the cocktail of medicines that were tried. In the long run Chrissy ended up being admitted to the care of Albany Medical Center for 2 weeks. She had taken a quick turn that ended up with an unimaginable amount seizures throughout the day and night which came along with a slew of additional neurological issues, one being loss of short term memory. What we have learned so far by the series of tests which included a spinal fluid tap is that she has autoimmune encephalitis. There are still other areas of concern being looked into and we are blessed to find that she responded well to the IV-IG treatment thus far. Prior to begining the treatment was was placed on a high dose of steroids to bring down the swelling in her brain while more tests were performed. We are so grateful for the care she has received from her team of neuro doctors at AMC. There is still so much unknown but we do know that this is projected to be very long road of recovery for her (and her family) in all areas (physical, cognitive, mental health, etc). Chrissy is home now and continuing her recovery while being around the love of her children, husband, dog and close relatives. Some of her tests had to be sent out to the Mayo clinic and we are still awaiting those results. This has not been the only health issue taking a toll on this family. Chrissy was diagnosed with an aggressive form of Rheumatoid Arthritis a couple years ago which has had its own challenges and limitations.Chrissy is a mom of two, a 13 yr old girl and 8 yr old boy. She is the best mom to this very special niece and nephew of mine. Chrissy is also blessed to have married a man that has an abundance amount of love for her. The road ahead is still uncertain and will not always be that easy. She is not ready to carry the independency she one had but we know she will get there! Right now she needs 24/7 care during her recovery. This situation comes with financial hardship and uncertainty as they are a family of one income and have been stretched thin due to the increase in medical bills over a short period of time. My wish is to be able to lighten their load in any way that I think is possible. We understand not everyone will be able to support them by giving a monetary donation at this time.

On Monday November 18th a tragic fire took the lives of 3 angels living on Eastland ave but one triumphant fighter got out just in time to get rushed to the vet.

She took in a lot of smoke and has underwent a lot of things to keep her alive but things are looking good.

$1,000 of her medical bills has already been covered but we need $1000 more for her to finish recovery and be released.

Her mom lost everything in the fire... literally nothing was left to even pick through. That being said she is in desperate need of help not only financially but spiritually. Her spirits are so defeated and I think she needs to see how much our community not only loves her but loves her kitten, too.

A $1, a share or a prayer would move mountains right now. Please give what you can.

On January 10th, nine-year-old Olivia Butterworth, a healthy, vivacious, and beautiful fourth grader at Wampautauck Elementary school in Scituate Mass, received the shocking news that she has a rare, aggressive childhood cancer known as Neuroblastoma. Olivia's disease had metastasized to Stage 4 and the doctors at Boston Children's Hospital and the Jimmy Fund have begun a grueling 18-month treatment plan that will require incredible amounts of strength and perseverance from Olivia and her family. Olivia has already shown an incredible amount of bravery and grace in the face of a disease that has turned her life upside-down. Olivia's family is ready to fight and will do what it takes to cure Olivia. They understand that there will be regular refinement of the treatment plan based on progress but have been told to prepare for a highly-intensive course of treatment that will include both outpatient visits and extended stays at the hospital. Many of Olivia’s prescribed treatments are still in trial and not covered by insurance. Both Jill and Jay have been advised by the hospital to be prepared for the unexpected both in their schedules and with expenses.In just a little over a month, Olivia and her family have already logged hundreds of miles back and forth into Boston. Olivia passes the time in the car listening to her favorite singer Kacey Musgraves and often comments on all the billboards she passes. She said her favorite thing about the clinic is when she waves at other kids being treated and they wave and smile back. Olivia is an avid swimmer and usually spends the majority of her summer on the beach bodysurfing and playing in the sand with her friends. Her treatment plan will require her to be hospitalized for most of this summer as she endures two stem cell transplants which will mean extended hospital stays, and several weeks of recovery and isolation. Due to the port installed in her chest, she will be unable to swim but she is thinking fishing might be a good way to get her fix of the ocean when her health allows.Contributions to this Go-FundMe page will be managed by Olivia's mom, Jill, and dad, Jay, to ensure that medical and associated treatment and care costs can be covered. Your contributions will help ensure that Olivia is comfortable and that her parents can focus their energy on her care and well-being.We will provide updates on Olivia on this page, so please do check back frequently. Olivia has already logged two rounds of chemo, two surgeries and will begin round 3 of chemotherapy in early March. For those of you blessed to know Olivia, you will not be surprised to know that her spirits are high and her signature brand of humor is still intact. She relishes the days when she can attend school and often talks about all the things she looks forward to doing when her treatment is over.Thank you for your love, support, and prayers.

He has recently had an operation where they took out half of his jaw and teeth, and grafted a chunk of his leg into his mouth.

She also saw her son John on Sunday the 5th. Shortly after their conversation, she began experiencing convulsions and was rushed to a local hospital where it was determined that she had suffered a massive stroke. Over the course of the next two days, she continued to experience multiple strokes as blood clots broke up. She has suffered serious damage to both sides of her brain, and has lost the ability to communicate or control her motor functions.Due to the cancer prognosis, recovery from the strokes is not possible. Even with intensive chemo therapy, she would not have survived long, but the strokes have further complicated the situation.Those who know Terri know that she is one tough lady. She's lived through more things that would have a killed a lesser woman than almost anyone. This, however, seems to be an unwinnable battle.The tragedy of this situation cannot be understated. In the last year, Terri and her husband Owen (Turtle) had made immense strides toward building the life of which they had always dreamed. Terri created a business cleaning cottages on Joe's Pond in Danville, Vermont and the pair recently moved into Terri's dream house. Despite facing health challenges of his own, including a massive heart attack a year and a half ago, Turtle has been working hard to support Terri in creating the life she always dreamed of. Following the cancer diagnosis, Terri made it clear that she wanted to be buried at their home.In Vermont, this is legal, and we've checked with a funeral home to get the details. The family needs to raise $4,000 to pay for the casket, transport, and proper burial on the grounds.While Terri is still holding on, she is currently hospitalized and receiving palliative care, and she is not expected to recover. The doctors are doing everything they can to keep her comfortable until she drifts away from this life. She does not wish to be embalmed, which creates a short window for burial when the time comes. This leaves her husband and sons the immensely difficult task of trying to pay for her funeral. Six months ago, Terri was healthy and strong as ever. She does not have a life insurance policy.This Go Fund Me is being managed by Terri's son Roy and her daughter-in-law Sheila. All funds raised will go to cover funeral costs, and anything above that amount will go toward outstanding medical bills and toward Terri's home and final resting place.If you can donate and share, the family would greatly appreciate it.Hold your loved ones close, and please prioritize what is most important in this life - your relationships and letting those you love know that you love them. This situation has taught us all just how fragile this life can be.Thank you for your time and your support.Read more"

She also visits children's schools for education, helps the hospital with community outreach, and has an online presence.

On Sunday , June 28th, Priscilla Queen of the Desert suffered an intense heat stroke and was rushed to Charleston Veterinary Referral Center where she was quickly and lovingly nurtured back to sustainable body temperature. Even though friends found her in the knick of time and she is slowly but steadily recovering , treatment and vet care are still needed for a few more days while she nurses back to full health. When she was admitted into the clinic , her internal body temp was at 104 degrees (dogs average body temp is around 102) and she was extremely dehydrated. When dogs have heat strokes it can cause numerous problems including kidney failure , seizures, brain damage , and heart failure. Miss P’s white blood cell count was nonexistent upon arrival at the vet , and they immediately began plasma transfusions and antibiotic treatments to get her stats back up to normal. Her condition is still “guarded” which means she is under observation and is receiving at least one transfusion a day. Last we heard , she is able to drink water on her own but is still exhausted and generally in discomfort. Needless to say, these vet bills are stacking up due to the amount of treatments and therapy the talented staff of vets and assistants are administering to her. We are asking for any help and donation you can give while we try to bring our fave girl back to health and her loving self. If anyone has met Miss P they will surely know how stubborn she is and how willfully spirited she can be, so we know she will pull through this. We just need help making it happen. Anything Helps. We will continue to update this page and her instagram as we find out more news about her recovery. She is scheduled to possibly be in the care of the vets the rest of this week, but that can change on a day to day basis. We appreciate you and Miss P loves you.

My son, Ephrain was the victim of a targeted shooting, while working in downtown Orlando. Needless to say, our family and friends were shocked. Ephrain is a loving caring son, brother and friend with a heart of gold. Why would anyone want to hurt him??Late Thursday night, group of people pulled up on electric rental scooters and attempted to force their way in through the exit of Aero assaulting the small, female security worker working that door. Of course Ephrain and several others immediately rushed to assist their co-worker and a tussle ensued. Eventually, the group left, while issuing threats. No one really took them seriously, as people issue empty threats frequently in bars, but approximately an hour later, they returned, specifically targeting Ephrain. They caused a disturbance to distract him and when he went over to talk to them, the shooter came around and shot Ephrain twice in the abdomen. He was rushed to the hospital via ambulance where he underwent emergency surgery. The perpetrators of this act fled the scene in a white vehicle with damage to the right rear door.Ephrain sustained injuries to his abdomen where 1 bullet entered and exited. The path of the second bullet caused intestinal damage with bullet fragments damaging a vertebrae, causing spinal trauma. He has so far undergone 2 surgeries to remove/repair a portion of his intestine and colon and doctors say they will have to perform at least one more surgery to stabilize his spine. At this time, he is unable to move his legs, although he does have some sensation.Ephrain will likely have to go through months, if not years of rehabilitation, in addition to living with the psychological trauma of being shot. Obviously, Ephrain will not be able to return to his job in security any time soon. But in addition to working in security, Ephrain is deeply involved in the tightly knit Orlando area Martial Arts community, where he has dedicated over a decade to teaching both children and adults. Patient and soft spoken, he has always been excellent with children, even when he, himself, was a child. Needless to say, without being able to work, the medical bills will start to pile up, as well as other living expenses, placing undue stress on Ephrain which will in turn, hinder his recovery efforts.Ask anyone and they'll tell you that Ephrain is one of the nicest, most generous and caring people that you'll ever meet. He's always willing to step up when needed. Now, during his time of need, we would love for our community to return some of the love and kindness that he has freely given over the years. Any little donation will help so that he can focus on his long road to recovery and rehabilitation.

Back in Sept of 2019, Tyler had a reaction to a medication that the doctors put him on that landed him in ICU for a week which caused all sorts of medical problems for him.

Weare asking for your support because your help will insure that we can afford the equipment like a ramp to enter the house, an elevator so that we can get him up and down the stairs and medical treatments that Tyler’s needs to make a recovery, but you will also allow Tyler to completely focus on his health so that he can take his next step forward in life.

He has seemed to become a regular at Blake's Crossing Veterinary Clinic, however he has now been transferred to a 24/7 Emergency Clinic in Norwood.Rocco is a fit, healthy and loving little boy - he has recently been diagnosed with pneumonia. Whilst struggling to breathe without cords feeding through everywhere, the CT scan has shown a cyst which is causing his lungs (which are already heavily full of fluid) to bleed which is his biggest concern. The stability of his health needs to be improve before they can take him into surgery and remove this cyst.Prior to any surgery or further treatment from today, his vet bills are already in effect of $8,000. His parents are both in their early 20's - as you can imagine, this is a huge cost to source funds for, but they aren't willing to give up on him.

He was never taken back to the doctor for a follow up to get a lens put in.The doctors told us that by not having this lens, it can create problems with pressure regulation in the eye, which is more than likely the cause for Keith's retinal detachment back in January.Shortly after the new year, Keith began experiencing severe migraines and vision loss in his eye. He went to his eye doctor as soon as he knew the vision loss was not getting any better and he began experiencing permanent black spots and flashes of light in his eye. His eye doctor then referred him to a retina specialist to confirm what they thought was the issue, a retinal detachment.Mid January, Keith was scheduled for his first vitrectomy to reattach his retina and the first approach consisted of a gas bubble and face down positioning for a week to keep the retina in place while it healed.About 1.5 weeks after the surgery, Keith began noticing similar symptoms to the ones he was having prior to the surgery. It turns out the retina detached again because the scar tissue grew in too quickly. According to the doctor, Keith's young age is working against him since this is not a common issue amongst young adults.Keith went in for his second attempt to re-attach the retina mid February, this time the procedure was much more intensive, consisting of a scleral buckle and a thick gel to keep the retina in place during recovery. This recovery seemed very promising and we were all hopeful it would be a favorable outcome. However, when the time came for the 3rd surgery to remove the thick gel and replace it with a long term silicone oil, as the thick gel was being removed, the retina started to go with it. They were able to reattach the retina and continue with the silicone oil.Within 24 hours after his 3rd surgery, at his post op appointment the doctor indicated that he started developing a unrelated tear in his eye due to the trauma done to his eye from the previous surgeries. They quickly fixed the tear during that appointment.At Keith's most recent appointment, the retina is yet again detaching due to complications with the trauma and scar tissue his eye has encountered. He is scheduled for another surgery on March 23rd which will be going back to the thick gel and a longer recovery period to try and save his eye.This has been such a long and tiring process, we were not expecting Keith to be out of work for more than 3 months, let alone all of the medical expenses that came along with multiple surgeries.Keith and I both would love to work for the money and sell items/ goods to help fundraise, but I have already picked up a part time job, with another on the way to help pay for these procedures. We were close to deciding not to continue with the surgeries since each one ranges from $1,000-$3,000.We are hoping that one last round of surgeries can save the vision in his left eye and not leave him partially blind.Anything will help us out greatly since we are looking at a final bill of close to $10,000.It was not an easy decision to make a gofundme since we hate asking for help, but the last few months have not gone to plan and we are hoping this surgery and recovery gets us back on track.Thank you for taking the time to read this and for the outpouring support,OliviaRead more"

At 6 weeks old we found out that my Frenchie Tony was born with a rare genital condition called Hypospadias requiring early surgery. We had to make a decision within a few days about whether we still wanted him or if not he would most likely be euthanised.





We decided we would give Tony the best chance at life and get him the surgery he needs. The surgery was completed in January and was a success however since the surgery he has been having seizures.










He has had 15 seizures in 3 months and has been to the specialist vet hospital three times completing many tests which have all come back clear. Although he has been placed on epilepsy medication, it’s clear that it’s not working as the seizures are continuing and he urgently needs an MRI in order for us to find out the cause.










Our bills are starting to pile up and we have already spent over $5K on surgery & medical tests. Unfortunately Tony does not qualify for pet insurance due to his pre-existing congenital condition which he was born with. Tony is only 7 months old and has such a kind and loving nature. Its breaking our heart seeing him suffer and we want to do what we can to allow him to live a long happy life.










We are starting this page to help raise funds to pay for Tony’s MRI, Spinal scan and ongoing medical fees.










We ask that all those who know, love or want to help Tony donate so we can get our boy on the road the recovery.










Thank you from the bottom of our heart ❤️❤️










Update 18/03


Tony had his MRI and Spinal tab today, unfortunately Tony has a brain disease called meningoencephalitis which causes inflammation and fluid in his brain. We began the steroid treatment today and the next few days will tell us how his responding. The specialists are concerned he has a bad strain of this disease which doesn’t respond to medication and the life expectancy is only a few months. The spinal tab results will come back tomorrow and can sometimes indicate which strain of the disease he has. Tony still has mild head tremors and his body was abit shaky. He is able to stand and walk around a bit, but his still abit dull and not very reactive to us.


We just pray and pray the next few days look better and we get some good results. We need this boy in our lives, his just too special. We know the road to recovery will be long but we are ready for anything and just want a boy back in our arms.




Thank you so much for all the kind message and donations we have received. It has made such a huge difference to our situation and allowed us to focus on tony without being to overwhelmed with the vet bills. ❤️❤️




Update 22/03



We brought Tony home on Friday evening, hoping he was now in the clear. Unfortunately after about 2 hours of being at home he started having partial seizures. We kept monitoring him and throughout Saturday he began full seizuring again, walking frantically in circles and frantically moving his head around as if there were flys around him. We rushed him back to the specialist and they stabilised him, the inflammation on his brain was causing all of this and we’re lucky we took him back as these were signs he was going to have a seizure which they were able to prevent with diazepam injections. Tony is still currently in the specialist hospital and he has been having a few seizures still. We’re desperately trying to buy time to allow his anti flammatory medication and his chemo treatment (which is supposed to help reduce swelling also) kick in. The specialists think it’s to early to give in yet and wants to try keep him going and allow the meds to work which can take up to 2 weeks for his body to start responding.



Financially it has been so difficult to keep him in there, it’s around $1000 every 24 hours his at the hospital. Our bill to check him out on Friday was $8400 and we’re currently at an extra $2500 from Saturday to tomorrow. We don’t know what the coming weeks are going to look like, but we hope we can financially support Tony to keep him in VSOS and allow his little body to start working with the meds.



We are so grateful for all the donations thus far and we really wouldn’t be in the position we are in without you guys. We going to keep trying to fight for Tony, if you are able to contribute anything will help us along with Tony.



Thank you from the bottom of ours hearts ❤️

About .75 miles into the hike, Otis came upon a rattlesnake that was crossing the trail. I didn't see the rattlesnake at this point and by the time I did, Otis had already encountered it and had been bit on the left side of his snout. He jumped back immediately and started pawing at his nose in pain and shock; at this point I noticed that it was indeed a rattlesnake and that it was maybe 2 feet in front of me, in the middle of the trail, recoiled and rattling loudly at us. He is a hero and saved me from being bit, as I surely would have walked directly into it. I quickly pulled Otis away and we moved down the trail to a safe spot where I could examine his wound. He had two bloody fang mark wounds on the left side of his snout and his face was beginning to swell up very quickly. I called the nearest vet office as we quickly moved down the trail back to the car, but they didn't have anti-venom available, so we had to drive 25 minutes to the nearest emergency animal hospital that could treat him with anti-venom and pain medication. He became more and more lethargic and began panting very rapidly while in the car.Due to COVID-19, the nurses had to meet us in the parking lot to pick up Otis and we weren't allow inside to comfort him. He arrived with a fever of 105 degrees.Hereceived anti-venom and pain medication within 40 minutes of the initial bite and he stayed overnight at the emergency animal hospital to be monitored. We are hoping that he will make a full recovery.Unfortunately, I do not have pet insurance (a mistake I won't make again), and one vial of anti-venom costs $700-800 dollars. He was also put on an IV of fluids as well as fentanyl to help with the pain, as rattlesnake bites are extremely painful. I am so grateful for the care from the vet and nurses, but any pet owner knows that the vet is not cheap, especially in a dire situation. The final treatment costs will be around $2,500, so I am hoping to fundraise $1,500 of that cost, as I just recently finished graduate school at Texas Christian University (TCU) on May 12 and am currently unemployed. Until I am hired somewhere, funds will be tight even without the cost of treating Otis.Otis means to the world to me and I would do anything for him, including putting my pride aside and asking for help when I need it, no matter how uncomfortable it feels asking people for money. Any donation helps and I know that Otis would appreciate it more than anything. Thanks so much for your consideration!Read more"

Hello friends. Thanks for taking the time to read this. My 4 year old Pomeranian recently ate an unknown foreign object which is now lodged in her small intestine. She has not eaten since Sunday, and hasn’t been able to hold anything down. She stayed the night at an emergency vet last night on fluids, but has not made any progress. The vets think that if it has not passed by now that it won’t. This has become life threatening and it looks like she won’t make it with out the surgery. Unfortunately I can not afford the cost of her surgery. As many of you know I struggle to ask for help so this is difficult for me but it is a matter of life and death for the most important being in my life. Peaches is registered as an emotional support dog and has helped me tremendously with my anxiety and ptsd. She is my best friend and the only constant I have had in my life for the last 4 years. I am devastated and heart broken to say the least. Any help can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thanks again for taking the time to read and share thisRead more"

Hi all,My name is Louise, and I’m raising money on behalf of my grandpa in the Philippines. He is in the ICU right now following a burst aneurysm in his kidney and is currently awaiting surgery. Right now he is in a private hospital, as all public hospitals in the Philippines are prioritizing COVID patients. Unfortunately, the hospital bills are much more expensive in a private hospital. My parents and I are in Los Angeles supporting our family in Manila, but the hospital bills are a big cost to our family all around.

My Papa is a kind, hard-working, and selfless man who has served his community for many decades. He goes out of his way to make sure that the people he cares about are comfortable and happy, and we want nothing but the same for him. We are hoping for a swift and smooth recovery, and to bring him home.Any amount helps and the proceeds will go towards my Papa’shospitalization, medicine, medical supplies, surgery, blood transfusions, treatment, and recovery. We are extremely grateful for anything that comes his way ❤️❤️❤️Thank you very much and if you have any questions please don’t hesitate to contact me ❣️

Thank you and all the best,Louise Tamondong

I have created this fundraiser for my one and only younger Brother Syed Hasan, who is diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Stage 5 and require immediate Kidney Transplant.Syed Hasan, is my talented brother who is only 30 Years Old. He has graduated with first-class honours in Software Engineering from Asia Pacific University, Malaysia. I have two younger sisters who are currently doing their undergraduate degree in university. My father, at the age of 63 is the sole earner of the family. He is supporting the educational expenses of my sisters and ongoing medical treatment of my Brother.On February 2020, my brother was diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Stage 5. CKD is a condition when the kidneys are unable to carry out the usual function of removing toxins from the body and the patient is required to either go through long-term dialysis or get a kidney transplant. After the diagnosis, my brother had to go through an emergency operation to install a Central Venous (Permanent) Catheter insertion in order to receive immediate haemodialysis. He was also diagnosed with severe anaemia which required sessions of blood transfusion. The above procedure was executed by Dr. Wahab Khan a senior Nephrology specialist at Bangladesh Specialised Hospital (BSH), Dhaka.Currently he is undergoing haemodialysis at our hometown Chittagong, twice a week (4Hrs per session) through the CV Catheter, which is directly attached through his heart. He is currently under the supervision of Nephrology specialist Dr. Pradip Kumar Dutta. Till date, he has gone through almost 100 Haemodialysis session, which has exerted enormous strain on his body and introduced many complications. As per the Doctor’s advice he requires an immediate kidney transplant as he is facing complications due to the advert effect of long-term dialysis. He has also developed primary hyperparathyroidism.As soon as possible, my brother has to go through Kidney Transplant procedure, as the long term haemodialysis is not sustainable for this health. This situation has wielded massive emotional strain on my family. As you would all be aware, there are huge expenses associated with pre-transplant diagnosis, and post-transplant procedures and care. We have been in consultation with senior Doctors from hospitals in Delhi to assess my Brother’s current situation and advise a plan to start the process of transplant. Estimated cost for the Kidney Transplant and parathyroid operation (inclusive of pre & post care) is approximately AUD$100,000 and at the moment we are targeting to raise at least $75,000 to start the procedure.Despite of his current health condition, my brother is very passionate and ambitious about his career. Before he moved to Bangladesh, he was employed as an Application Developer in a reputed Technology firm in Kuala Lumpur. He was also an academic researcher and in mid-2019 he joined Southern University in Chittagong as a computer science lecturer. But due to his medical condition he was unable to pursue his dream. Let’s pray and hope that an ambitious soul like Syed is able to live a rewarding life and be an example who dreams to flourish the tech society after his recovery from the Kidney transplant.Being the eldest daughter, I am trying my best to support my father in this time of crisis. Many of our friends and extended family members have supported us with the best possible way. Now I am reaching out to you all, to come forward and support my Little Brother in his fight against CKD.

This is Brodie, my 1 year old husky puppy.Brodie escaped from my home in Coconut Gove on Wednesday March 10th around 12 noon.He was seen being hit by a car by a neighbor and hobbling away. I spent 7 excruciating hours searching frantically for him, posting to social media groups, calling shelters/vet, and eventually found him by the side of the road near home in a lot of pain around 7pm.His legs were badly damaged and bloody. He was scared, in pain and distressed.

I immediately rushed him to the Pet Emergency room where he is currently in care.The wee man’s damages from being hit by the car(s) are heart breaking:- He has a hole in his lung that is complicating his other surgical procedures needed and treatment on the lung is estimated at $20,000. The hole is impairing his ability to breathe. In the short term, he is hooked up to a breathing vacuum but this can not be sustained. His other surgeries can not take place until his lung is under control.- In his hip, the ball was blown out of the socket by the impact of the car. Requires surgery to be fixed. Estimate is TBD.- Head of the little mans femur needs to be sewn off. This is estimated at $5,000. He will lose mobility in his leg and most likely have affected walking and running.- He needs Surgery on soft tissue of his leg(s) ligament and tendons. This is estimated at $5,000-on top of this, his daily care and nurse/doctor supervision is inclusive of radiographs, blood work, medication, and X-rays estimated at $500 per day. Starting Mar 10. It looks to be a long road ahead as we wait and see if the lung hole heals naturally before operating on his chest.

Brodie means EVERYTHING to me. I got him at 8 weeks old and it’s been me and him vs the world. I made a promise to him that I would take care of him, and that is what I am trying to do.I am missing my morning cuddles right now, when he jumps up on the bed, lays back and throws his limbs out 'asking' aka demanding, his belly rub with his tail going crazy! His little head buried into my shoulder. Heis my little buddy. We run together early every morning. Truly man’s best friend. Those big piercing blue eyes constantly checking on me and looking up at me as we run and his big tongue hangs out to the side! Such a happy dog!When I come home from work at lunchtime to see him and he is so excited that all he can do are zoomies around the living room like he is on American Ninja Warrior!When he smells dinner and he knows to sit like a good boy in his seat and waits patiently to be rewarded. Such a beautiful well behaved boy.He makes me laugh when I go the bathroom and he tries to 'protect' me by sitting at the door and not moving. I am missing him following me from room to room. Even if he looks like he is sleeping in one room. As soon as I move, he moves. And lays down at my feet. Always just touching me. Just a little paw.At night time, no matter what, he just wants to be close to me. Always by the side of the bed. Always within a couple of feet. Always aware of where I am. Always loving and trusting.The overwhelming care and support for Brodie's safety and recovery from the Miami community over the past 48 hours has floored me. I am so grateful for all those who helped me find him, shared his posts, sent encouraging thoughts and best wishes. I just want my buddy back, healthy and safe. Anything at all helps. Thank you from the bottom of my soul.Andy T

We are raising funds for Zipper's vet bills and ongoing care to ensure he receives the best treatment possible, and has the greatest chance at making a full recovery. If you have any money you are willing to donate to this cause, we would be deeply grateful.The Dog AttackOn Thursday, August 13, at around 8:20 PM, Zipper was attacked by a Shiba Inu dog at Emery Barnes Park. The owner and the Shiba Inu approached Sarah and Zipper. The dogs sniffed each other and the Shiba was initially friendly towards Zipper. Sarah offered the Shiba treats, which he took, but when she offered Zipper treats, the other dog viciously bit Zipper on his head. It happened quickly and without warning. There was a significant amount of blood. Zipper cried out, disoriented, wounded, and in extreme distress. Despite how quickly the events transpired, Sarah had the wherewithal to immediately apply pressure to Zipper's head wound with cloth. A woman from Sarah's building (whose name we will not disclose for the sake of her privacy) offered to drive Sarah and Zipper to the animal emergency centre. They were able to get to the hospital in less than 15 minutes. Sarah's quick thinking, and the incredible kindness of this woman, were likely crucial in getting Zipper to the hospital quickly enough to stabilize his condition, and save his life.Zipper's ConditionZipper is currently in critical, but stable, condition. He is at the animal emergency centre receiving round the clock care. The veterinarian believes that Zipper sustained a cranial fracture from the bite, with possible brain damage. However, the fracture appears to have punctured outwards, not inwards, which is good news. Zipper's eyes were initially swollen shut, but the swelling is now starting to go down. When Zipper initially arrived at the centre he could not move his back legs, but today we've received an update that he is able to walk, he is eating, and he is starting to regain his energetic and squirmy ways. We remain cautiously optimistic about his progress.One thing is for certain, while Zipper may be just a tiny pup, he has got a lot of fight in him.Zipper's StoryZipper is 8 weeks old. He grew up in Vernon in a litter of 8 puppies. On August 6, 2020 he and the rest of his litter got their first shots and were driven to Vancouver where they were each picked up by their new owners. Sarah held Zipper for the first time on Friday, August 7, 2020. When he was placed into her arms he immediately began nuzzling and kissing her face. It was love at first sight. Sarah has been taking care of him ever since, and he has run her through the standard puppy parenting hurdles--waking up regularly throughout the night for pees, constant walks and intermittent naps, and endless fun playing with toys and exploring the world. He is a sweet natured puppy. Wherever he goes he brings smiles to peoples faces.He also happens to be, quite possibly, the most handsome puppy on the planet. Photo evidence:


The Veterinary BillsFortunately, Sarah does have pet insurance for Zipper, which has covered a significant portion of the vet bills so far. She paid a $900 non-refundable deposit on the first vet bill (which includes the $700 deductible required by her insurance policy). The remainder of the first vet bill was $4,500, 90% of which was covered by insurance, leaving Sarah to pay $450. Her out-of-pocket cost so far is $1,350. We anticipate that the final bill will be significantly greater, as that only covers Zipper's first two nights of care at the ER, and doesn't include any costs related to his transfer to care under the neurology team.While we are cautiously optimistic about Zipper's progress, and we hope he will be able to leave the emergency centre soon and make a full recovery, we also realize that he has sustained a significant head trauma and his recovery is going to take a long time and a lot of medical support. There will unfortunately be a number of larger bills to come. In addition, while the pet insurance does cover a portion of the medical procedure costs, it does not cover the costs associated with rehabilitation. We will continue to keep the community updated about these bills, and the other costs associated with Zipper's care.We Are Asking for Your SupportWe have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and kindness from the community. A number of people have reached out offering to put money towards Zipper's vet and care bills--and we are so, so grateful. This money will help us ensure Zipper receives the best care possible, and has the greatest chance at making a full recovery.If you have any money you are willing to donate, you will forever have our gratitude and appreciation.Who I AmI realize that some people may be confused by the fact that my name and Sarah's name is the same. Our shared loathing of our ridiculously common name was one of the first things we bonded about. To clarify--I am not Sarah's alter ego (though that would be cool). I am one of her good friends, and I am posting this Go Fund Me with her permission and support.What About the Shiba Owner?Thanks to the help of many people on social media, we have been able to find the Shiba owner, and he has gotten in touch with Sarah of his own volition. We are hopeful he will take responsibility for the actions of his dog and will contribute to Zipper's veterinarian bills. While we understand that many people are upset, angry, and confused about this owner's failure to control his dog, we do not want this fundraiser to be used as a platform to attack his character. In keeping with that, please refrain from any negative comments about the Shiba or the owner. We would like this to remain a positive space, and to focus on Zipper's recovery. We appreciate your understanding in this regard.

They think that it's a combination of him being overweight and a possible developmental issue. I really don't want him to be in pain anymore and that's pretty much the only option other than putting him down - something I don't want to do.I got a quote from the hospital I took him to and they said the surgery would cost anywhere between 5[phone redacted]. (Edit: I changed the goal because I found a hospital that charges less!) The funds would go directly towards his surgery and any medication needed during his post-op recovery. I currently have pain medicine for him for the next week but need to get him in to consult with a surgeon ASAP because he doesn't really walk, he takes a few steps to readjust himself and then lies back down. He lifts his back left foot up and doesn't put weight on it anymore. After surgery and recovery, I'll work towards weight management to make sure he's okay and it doesn't happen on his other hip.

On February 7th, when most families were preparing to watch the “big game”, we discovered that our dad - Mark Martin - had a large brain tumour. For a moment, time stood still, and in an instant, our world collapsed. That afternoon, Mark was in a single-vehicle accident which resulted in him being transported to hospital. It was later discovered that the accident came as a result of a seizure that Mark suffered while driving, a seizure caused by immense pressure within his brain. That evening scans revealed a large tumour growing on the right frontal lobe which required immediate medical intervention.On February 9th, Mark received emergency neurosurgery to remove a portion of the primary mass. An emergency craniotomy and partial excision were necessary to debulk the tumour and relieve the excessive pressure within Mark’s skull that would have certainly resulted in death if gone unrealized. As a result of the invasive nature of the surgery itself, and the location of the tumour on the brain, an incredibly strong, friendly and good-humoured man was left in an incomprehensible state of fear and uncertainty.As our world continued to crumble, Mark was formally diagnosed with grade 4 glioblastoma on February 22nd - an aggressive, multicentric, malignant brain tumour. A father, son, brother, uncle, teammate and friend, Mark is now also a cancer patient. If you have had the privilege of meeting Mark, I can all but guarantee that you have shared a belly laugh, a great story, or have created a cherished memory. Mark is a “giver” - be it the shirt off of his back, a warm meal, an adventure or a gesture of support. Mark is compassionate, kind, [objectively] very funny and incredibly fun to be around, he truly is remarkable. Mark has always taken care of those around him, be it a friend, a family member or a stranger, and now it is on us to take care of him.A glioblastoma is a deadly form of brain cancer with a grim prognosis, however, itis not without hope. Traditional methods of treatment for glioblastoma are severely limited and show little promise for long-term survival, something that Mark and our family desperately crave. Effective treatment of glioblastoma requires innovative and extremely costly medical intervention which is not necessarily available through Canadian socialized healthcare. Those treatments which have shown the most success in securing longer-term survival are unavailable under OHIP, yet we remain determined to secure Mark the best possible treatment available. Unfortunately, this care is costly, and the aggressive nature of glioblast-oma has put us under an extremely tight timeline to begin care. Mark must begin treatment immediately.In addition to chemotherapy, radiation and complimentary (private) treatments, Mark requires ongoing physical therapy, occupational therapy, and emotional therapy to assist in his recovery. On average, Mark’s weekly medical care will cost thousands of dollars, and as a result of his cancer, Mark is currently completely unable to work as his tumour has given rise to significant physical and cognitive limitations. For decades, Mark has worked hard labour 6-7 days a week, often clocking in an excess of 12 hours per day in order to provide for his family. Unfortunately, Mark does not have private health coverage, and OHIP will not cover the costs of his additional life-saving therapies as they are accessible only through private healthcare clinics. And so, we ask you, our friends, family and community for help.Mark is truly one of the hardest working people you will ever have the pleasure of meeting. He is a warrior, always ready for battle. He is as tough as they come and is driven by his desire to live a long and meaningful life alongside family and friends. Mark has devoted his life to his family and has never been shy to offer a helping hand to those in need.We recognize the financial burden that many have suffered as a result of COVID-19. Where you may be unable to contribute financially, please do consider sharing Mark’s story. All funds will go directly to supporting Mark’s care. Our family truly hopes that you will help support us in our journey in any way possible. We maintain faith that Mark will survive. Please keep Mark in your thoughts and prayers during his battle against this horrible disease.With love, Shelby & Remy (Mark’s children)We will continue to post updates as they are made available to us.

I am begging everyone for help. I never thought that I would ask for help one day. I have been healthy since I was a child and never got sick. I lived like most of us. I have been in Scotland for many years. I have a family and my youngest son is 10 years old. Fate made me suddenly feel bad. My stomach started to hurt. I did an ultrasound scan which showed that I have stones in my left kidney. I wasn't worried about it. I was taking pills to dissolve the stones. I had weird pains all the time, but I thought the kidney was the cause. From January 2021 on, I started feeling very bad, but still thought it was those kidney stones. I was weakened and felt strange. The nightmare happened in February, when I started to lose weight a lot, I was getting more and more weak, diarrhea bored me for over 3 weeks. Strange symptoms such as itching of the skin started to develop and eventually jaundice appeared. On February 16th, 21st I was put into the emergency room at the hospital. I was accepted there. It turned out that there is an obstruction of the bile duct, therefore mechanical jaundice and pancreatitis caused by obstruction occurred. Two weeks in hospital, research. The versions were different until the PET scan was performed. It turned out I had a tumor on the bile ducts to the pancreas, liver, gallbladder and duodenum. Samples were taken for examination, and the excerpt stated that there was a suspicion of cancer. I was losing weight all the time and feeling unwell. On March 9 this year, I received information from my doctor that there was a biopsy result. I heard the verdict. A very rare squamous cell carcinoma with metastasis to the liver and possibly the chest. I heard the verdict, I started to cry. The doctor said the tumor couldn't be operated on. Chemistry will probably be applied. On March 16 this year, I am supposed to have an interview with the oncologist. My entire immediate family is devastated, including my little 10-year-old son. I want to live like everyone else, but will it be given to me. I'm even going to be treated in another clinic if I don't get help here. Time is running out and we don't have the money to try to overcome this stuff. I never thought life could be so fragile. We are not even aware of what a human being can wear. I don't work and I probably won't come back to work. Help gives me hope that maybe a miracle will happen and I will recover. Hope to have a chance of recovery. I am begging you for help. Every pound is so much for me.On March 16, I was at the oncologist. The doctor said they would use the chemotherapy for up to 2 weeks but did not know if the treatment would be successful. I am looking for different solutions. I contacted a clinic in Mexico that treats immunotherapy, but the costs are so enormous that I probably won't be able to use it. I will be grateful for every donation. I don't think I will raise as much money as the clinic in Mexico priced my treatment for, but I still hope that I will be able to treat myself in some other way. All the people who support me and who want to help me, I would like to thank you with all my heart.

On December 15, 2020, she left for school on an ordinary day, and collapsed on the playground. A ruptured blood vessel in her brain led to life-threatening bleeding. She almost died that day, requiring emergency surgery to relieve the pressure on her brain. The following day, she underwent embolization and craniotomy to prevent further bleeding and to relieve the pressure around her brain. The bleeding damaged the occipital lobe, but the increased pressure caused strokes of her thalamus and basal ganglia, deeper brain structures important for thinking and movement.Marina spent several rocky weeks in a medically induced coma, and eventually awoke and was taken off the ventilator. However, the strokes left her with significant deficits. She will need to again learn how to control her arms and legs, sit, stand, eat and talk. After 6 weeks in the ICU, Marina was transferred to Spaulding Rehab on January 25, 2021. She has a lot of work ahead of her, and we expect the recovery to take months, if not longer.Marina is an awesome kid who loves to play with her school and neighborhood friends, sing, dance, ski, snowboard, play field hockey and to spend time with her family and dog. We know that she is in there, and she is already making small steps towards recovery.One of the impending challenges is that insurance will dictate her length of inpatient rehab. If Mike and Sasha want to extend that level of care, the cost will be thousands of dollars per day. So many people have asked how they could help the Ganetsky family during this time. We are therefore raising funds to pay for extended inpatient rehab, as well as her care and continued therapy when she eventually comes home.Read more"

Dans story featured in the Washington Post, WTOP, and Fox5!! Thanksfor reading this incredible story of selflessness by Dan Reynolds, the handyman with a heart of gold. When Tony Antonelli needed some work done in his house and was recommended Dan for the job, he never imagined it would end up saving his life.In summary: Dan just donated his kidney but as a result will lose wages during his recovery. Here is his heartwarming story:

As Dan completed Tony’s relatively small home project, they had many friendly conversations. One day Dan asked Tony how he was feeling, and Tony casually mentioned that he would be needing to start dialysis soon as the kidney he had received from his wife three years earlier was scarring and not functioning well. And without any hesitation, Dan said, “I’d be honored to give you my kidney. Who do I call?” After many, many tests and visits to doctors’ offices (all throughout COVID and risking his safety time and time again!) and much thought, Dan was found to be a perfect match: Tony’s true guardian angel on Earth.But Dan, a vet of the Army Corps of Engineers, is a handyman (and a great one indeed!), and his profession means that he would not be able to work for at least 6-8 weeks during his recovery. He is an incredibly hardworking man and works long hours/6 days a week. He even worked his way out of homelessness by exchanging handyman work for rent from (another amazing) family in Gaithersburg. So not only did Dan give his kidney without hesitation, he also did it knowing that it would come at a huge financial cost to him. Dan and Tony are now recovering from a very successful transplant. If you'd like to wish Dan a speedy recovery, or hire him for a job, you can send him a message in the link. If you’d like to help cover his lost wages, consider donating below. Tony’s granddaughter said it best when she said “Dan is so kind, and the kind of person we need more of in this world.”Dan’s amazing story was featured in the Washington Post, WTOP, and Fox5!https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2021/03/12/kidney-donor-handyman-maryland/%3foutputType=amp

She was with family and friends when she slid down a snowy hill on a boogie board and crashed, suffering extensive injuries including numerous broken bones and a severe head injury. She was unresponsive and transported to Hilo Medical Center, where she received excellent care. Because of her injuries and trauma to her head, she had to be medevaced to the Queen’s Medical Center ICU that night to receive further care. Her dad and boyfriend (Kawika Roman) are currently by her side on Oʻahu as she undergoes multiple surgeries to address her injuries.Pua, a graduate of Kamehameha Schools Hawaiʻi (’15) and California Baptist University (’19), is known far and wide by family and friends as an outgoing, caring, and active young woman.

To know him is to love him. He is 10 years old and is number 3 of 4 kids. He is a spelling bee champ (on the down-low. He didn't even tell his family he was entering), a pro in all things sports, a computer whiz, and the list goes on and on. He's an incredible brother, friend, and cousin. He has a huge heart and would do anything for anyone. Right now, he needs our prayers and our help.Caleb started having headaches on and off and pain in his head and neck when he jumped on the trampoline and played. His family thought that he may have hit his head at some point while wrestling around with his siblings and cousins, resulting in a “goose egg” on the back of his head. When the ""goose egg"" and headaches weren't going away his family started to be more concerned. Last Thursday morning, he threw up his breakfast out of nowhere. He doesn't often get sick, so this series of events prompted his family to call their doctor. Caleb's dad serves full time in the Airforce and they are currently living on base. Their doctor sent them to the ER on base The ER doctor decided the symptoms were odd enough to do a CT scan. After the scan, he asked if a nurse could stay with Caleb while he talked with his parents in another room. Their hearts dropped. They had found a mass on Caleb’s brain.His parents held it together as best they could and explained to Caleb that they needed better pictures and he would need to go and have an MRI done. After the MRI, the doctors thought they had a diagnosis but said that Caleb needed to be transferred immediately to a pediatric hospital so he could see specialists. Because he was considered urgent, they went by ambulance.After numerous more tests, bloodwork, another MRI, and consults with the Neuro and Pediatric teams, they finally confirmed that Caleb has a tumor in the bone on the back of his head. The specialists came up with a surgical plan and the tumor will be removed on Monday, July 13th. From there, the doctors will need to do pathology and decide if any further action needs to be taken. It seems like this is rare but treatable. For that, his family is so grateful. The surgery is not going to be an easy one and recovery will be tricky.His family is having to travel back and forth from their home to the pediatric hospital in the next state over. Only one parent is allowed to stay with him in the hospital because of Covid19, so the other is having to pay for lodging.We're hoping to be able to ease their burden so that Caleb's family can just focus on getting him through this and not have to worry about finances.Any little bit will help and I know Caleb's family will be incredibly grateful.Please send all the love and prayers you can for sweet Caleb!Read more"

I'm amazed at how quickly we raised $2750. I've actually had to turn off donations because I don't think I can fit that much stuff in the Jeep. Anyone else who is looking to help out should look into charities like Team Rubicon ( teamrubiconusa.org ) that make an incredible impact on the recovery effort.___________________________________________________________Update:Just wanted to reach out to everyone and say thank you for all the support. Over $2,000 in just over 24 hours is unbelievable.I'm currently wrapping up the application process to join Team Rubicon. They are a non profit relief organization that did tremendous work in Rockaway after Hurricane Sandy. Their volunteer requirements normally include military service or active first responder status however my experience with Sandy and my certification in advanced first aid and AEDs was the enough to qualify. After I complete a few online courses on emergency preparedness and incident response through FEMA I'll be making my way towards Houston to spend Labor Day weekend volunteering in what ever capacity they need me.Before I leave I'm going to use every dollar we raised to purchase things like non perishables, tools, and sanitary items until my car is full. Any additional funds left over after packing my car out will likely be used to buy gift cards for victims or donated directly to Team Rubicon to help them continue their support.I'll be sure to update everyone once again when I'm getting ready to leave.Again thanks for all the support!___________________________________________________________New York peeps, I'm driving over from New Orleans to the Houston area affected by Hurricane Harvey at the end of the week. It will likely be past the hour of rescue when I arrive however anyone who was in Rockaway or south Brooklyn during Sandy remembers especially well how terrible organizations like the Red Cross are with donations. They keep .99 of every dollar and by the time that .01 is put to use people like us have already stepped in to help our neighbors. These people are experiencing the same pain we did. So I'm asking for donations so that I can pack my jeep with all the things we once so desperately needed in the wake of a natural disaster. Put your money where your mouth is and instead of offering a half ass prayer on Facebook. Donate what you can spare and I will make sure that everything makes it to the Houston area and is distributed to those that truly need it. I'll keep you updated along the way.NOLA, I know a lot us are living in areas where the pumps are down, I know a lot of us are going through our own thing right now but Houston more than any other city came to the call of aid when Katrina hit. If you aren't dealing with your own mess, or if you are and it's impossible for you to leave but you still want to help, donate a few bucks and know that somewhere in Houston someone who desperately needs help will get a little with your help.Read more"

This fundraiser was created on behalf of Michael and the Zyrek family.On February the 8th, Michael Zyrek, 20 years old, was working out with a friend and abruptly stopped due to what was described as massive headache and neck pain. With the help of his girlfriend Sophia, they made the decision to head to the emergency room at Sparrow Hospital. That decision to seek help immediately is what saved Michael's life. What came next was a world wind that no one expected. Shortly after arriving at the emergency room, Michael lost consciousness. A brain bleed was found and doctors needed to operate immediately. Michael's parents, Scott and Anne Zyrek raced to Lansing from Rochester Hills to be with their son. The procedure was completed to relieve pressure off of the brain via a drain, but now the challenge of fixing the root of the problem remained.It was determined that Michael has AVM (arteriovenous malformation) as well as an aneurysm located in and around the spinal cord at C2 and C3. The complexity of having both an AVM and an aneurysm along with the location of these issues leads to a case rarely seen by neurologists. The wonderful team at Sparrow Hospital attempted to fix the root of the problem, but had to retreat due to risk of paralysis.

Michael has now been transferred to the University of Michigan Neurology Intensive Care Unit. Our hope is they will be able to find another angle to address the issues and set him on his path to recovery. Doctors noted that Michaels case is extremely rare - one case every 15 years, if that. And even then his case is a 10 out of 10 in terms of complexity, according to his medical team (doctors, nurses, etc.).As a member of the Oakland Junior Grizzles AA hockey team from 3rd to 11th grade, Michael was a part of multiple State Championships. He helped lead Rochester United to its first ever regional championship in 2019 and earned an All Sate Honorable Mention. He graduated from Rochester Adams Highschool in 2019 and is currently pursuing a business degree at Michigan State University, as a sophomore. The brotherhood he found in hockey transitioned to a new brotherhood with Sigma Nu Fraternity where he recently was elected Vice President.Asking for help isn't easy, but Michael and the Zyrek family need it at this time. Even with good insurance, the cost of Michaels current care is overwhelming. If you are able to support in any capacity in their time of need it would be greatly appreciated.

The location of the tumor is in the part of the brain that controls emotion and speech function, as well as other senses, like smell and taste. She was immediately put on anti-seizure medication and began preparing for her craniotomy on February 4th.Post-surgery has been a rough road. Due to the location of the tumor, the surgeon was not able to remove it all all so radiation or chemotherapy treatment are inevitable. She is still experiencing memory problems and difficulty with balance and coordination.

On Monday March 8, 2021 Michael excitedly came to Michigan to start a new career, once he arrived he very suddenly started feeling sick and was taken to the ER. Once there he was diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs and discharged. After two days he took a really bad turn and was again rushed to the ER. Within 30 minutes of being in the ER he was put on life support and it was found that he not only has bilateral pneumonia but also sepsis- the doctors saying his lungs are the worst they have ever seen and we are really unsure how long he will be in the hospital.This all is hard on its own but the worst part is his wife, Melisa, is still in Florida waiting for the birth of their first child. Michael had planned to start his new position, then return home in time for Madison’s birth. Because Melisa is so close to her due date she is unable to travel to be with him. Michael is also the primary income for their family and has been without pay for two weeks and it is unknown how long he will be out of work as they think his recovery will be long. To add to this stress m, he does not have insurance and will have an extreme amount of medical bills.

The funds collected will go towards helping these two amazing parents to be pay for their bills while Michael is unable to work, and the remaining will go to Michael’s mounting medical bills. Thank you to everyone who has made it this far!

Dear Friends,

  It is with heavy hearts and minds that we bring this news. A very good friend of ours has had a serious medical issue, and has been fighting for her life for days. The family have not been able to even see her, because of the health protocols in place due to the pandemic.

  Many of us who travel each year to the Mojito have met Clinton and Sonia Tucker, from Newfoundland. When we have spoken to Clinton over the past few days, the emotion and desperation in his voice is apparent. He is out of his mind with worry over his wife, who has suffered a brain aneurysm. To complicate matters, a stroke has followed, and we all sit waiting for any news each new morning.

  Clinton and Sonia have two boys, both in their teens, who share the concern over their mother.



 It is time for those of us who have been unable to travel to our beloved second home due to the pandemic to come together to help this family, as their needs are real. For those of us who feel powerless to help at this time, we can put something together to help.

 Only Heaven above knows what the outcome of this will be. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family, please join with us to ease any financial burden on this family.

 God willing, Sonia will emerge from this to live a normal life, but her road to recovery could be long, and the family’s needs could be great for months if not longer...

 Please help us smash our goals, to help The Tuckers get through this difficult time.

Recently, our beloved friend was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of Chondroblastic Osteosarcoma. On March 24th, Jen will undergo massive surgery on her jaw to remove the tumor. Naturally, being diagnosed with cancer has taken Jen by surprise. Unfortunately, this being as aggressive as it is, is not allowing Jen much time to make financial preparations. Many of you may not be aware that teachers are not able to collect disability. In order for teachers to collect some type of disability they must purchase something like AFLAC or similar. For Jen, a single mom of three, having more money come out of her paycheck was not an option she could afford. Sadly, that means that when she goes out for surgery and recovery she will only have a limited amount of sick days to use before she goes on unpaid leave. There is no option for her to have any type of paid leave.Anyone that knows Jen, knows that she is the most loving, caring, energetic person who can bring life into any room that she walks into. She is a strong, independent woman who, if she could, would try to go through this alone rather than ask for help because she feels like she would be burdening someone. I have watched her handle this news with such grace and strength that it amazes me. She truly is Wonder Woman!I am asking for everyone to help Jen and her family during this very difficult time. The funds collected will help lessen the financial worry on Jen's mind so that she can focus on healing and getting well. Thank you in advance for your help!

But between Dave's non-covered medical expenses and the loss of work incomefor both of us, it's just a drop in the bucket. I'd like to make this a short story, but there doesn'tseem to be a way to do that and still help you understand why we have resorted to a campaign like GoFundMe. We are private people, and reticent to ask for help. But it's time.In 2013, Dave began a journey of still-unexplained medical events, culminating in a final diagnosis of osteomyelitis (infection of the bone) of the lower jow. Along the way, the medical community has tried multiplerounds of home antibioticIV infusions for weeks on end, 6 weeks of 5-days/wk. hyperbaric chamber treatments, numerous cocktails of oral antibiotics, and more,  Nothing workedfor any extended period of time,and the slow, often-excrutiatingly painful deterioration of Dave'slower jaw continued.  To this day,doctors remain mystified as to what has caused this disease - all lab results come back negative. Finally, the decision had to be made to move forward with a lower jaw replacement, and in in May of 2015,Dave's fibula bone (from his leg) was used in conjunction with a titanium support to create a newlower jaw. Dave's surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania was long, scary and extraordinarily expensive.For months it looked as though this surgery might have not only provided Dave with a new lower jaw, but possibly arrested the disease, and he was looking forward to getting a new set of lower teeth. He was progressing well in physical therapy, his pain was lessening more and more each day, and hehad gained back enough strength to begin to return to his piano tuning businessand his therapeutic massage work as an MFR therapist. Then, in September of 2015, a CT scan showed that the lower jaw deterioration had continued to progress. And unlike refunds that we can get when products that we buy don't do what they're supposed to, we still had to pay, and continue to pay, for all of these attempts to stop the progress of the disease.The costs have not just been medical. Our income loss has been and will continue to be substantial. Dave was unable to work fully for many months prior to surgery, and at all for months after surgery. Even now, his ability to work has been very limited. His recent hospitalization for pneumonia has resulted in even more loss of work for Dave, as will upcoming surgery/surgeries to continue to deal with more deterioration. I also am often unable to work during Dave's hospitalizations and recoveries in order to take care of him. Neither of us is a full-time benefitted employee with our employers, so when we don't work, we don't get paid. And our health insurance premiums are extraordinarily high. I have already postponed a needed hip replacement surgery while we wait for Dave's condition to stabilize enough for me to have the surgery, but that's not even in the mix right now.We realize that there are so many others out there that are in need, which is probably one of the many reasonswe find it difficult to ask for help. But we have finally come to acceptthat we are also in need, and we're asking for your help. So anything that you can give would be such a gift and so appreciated. But please realize that,if you aren't able to help with a monetary donation, your prayers, positive thoughts and healing energy are still worth millions.Read more"

Needless to say we would not be doing this were it not urgent or extremely necessary. Lord willing we can go past this goal with all of your help. Please spread the word. Every little bit helps. Be warned that this is long, but please read to the end. This is what happened: Cesar Perez, a name many people have heard, a smiling face many recognize, a person who has touched many people’s life, person who many consider a friend, a person who I consider my baby, my bro, my hero, my brother. I can write a whole book about him, but where do I even start?! I will start from the beginning of this nightmare/miracle. Friday January 12, 2018, will forever be embedded in my head and heart as the day I lost my brother twice and as the day that he fought and came back to life. Cesar was excited to go visit his family and girlfriend Chelsea for the long MLK Holiday weekend. He has always been an excellent and cautious driver, therefore the idea of him being near death never crossed our minds that day. I received a call from my sister asking if I had heard from our brother Cesar. Both my sister, Alicia, and Chelsea were both worried because it is not like Cesar to not answer. I started to call him, but it went straight to voicemail. I called friends and the last time they heard from him was earlier that day. He had last called his Chelsea to around 6:15 saying he was about an hour from Statesboro and would be there when she got off work. He never arrived. Something inside each one of us said that something was not right. My sister headed to Statesboro to meet with Chelsea, while my parents took off without really knowing where they were going. They just followed a feeling that said, “Go. Now.” I was in Atlanta, and all I could do was look for accidents on I16 that were about an hour away from Statesboro. I called hospitals from Statesboro, Metter, Swainsboro, etc. asking about accidents on I16 that I really did not know of. While I dialed, I told myself, “you are overreacting.” But, my gut feeling told me to keep dialing, something was awfully wrong, and I felt something sink in to the pit of my stomach. And then, I called the hospital in Dublin. “Hello, I am calling to see if there have been people brought in from an accident on I16. I am looking for my brother Cesar Perez.” “I am sorry I can not give information out. But, yes he is here. That is all I can say.” “Just tell me is he alive?!” “…He is…he is stable… at the moment.” “Thank you! I am on my way!” I could not breath. This was not real. I called my sister and Chelsea and they grabbed what they had in hand and took off for Dublin. My parents were already somewhere on I16, so they finally knew where they were headed. My sister and Chelsea kept calling, until my sister finally got a hold of the Doctor where he explained the extent of the injuries and that he was to be immediately transported by helicopter to the trauma center in Macon, Ga. At that moment, she called everyone and told us to change route to Navicent Health Hospital in Macon…the Trauma center. I arrived at 11:10pm, my parents shortly followed at 11:35 pm, and then my sister and Chelsea came at around 12:10am. We were all there before my brother arrived on the helicopter. We waited until 4 or 5am to finally see him. They had to sew him up, clean him, and make him “presentable.” Like I said, I can write a whole book just on these past 4 days. They have been endless. Amidst seeing my brother in a state that I would have never imagined, I must focus on the good I have seen. We really had no idea what happened until recently. My brother was traveling on I16 Eastbound, when a maniac who was driving westbound on the eastbound lane crashed into my brother’s car making the car spin over 300 ft into the westbound lanes where he was hit a second time by an 18 wheeler and thrown into the trees. We later found out that Cesar was conscious and held his own head while the first responders cut away at the car to get him out. It took over 40 minutes. It is a miracle he survived. Once we told him Cesar was stable, the officer said he could now tell us that they had to revive him twice. The officer said that he is a fighter; he is a miracle. He IS a miracle. He has been our miracle ever since he was born. Cesar has always been my partner, my bro, the one that could make me laugh even when I was angry, the one that would start making jokes to ease up situations, the one who would talk non stop, sometimes pure nonsense, but still made so much sense. This tragic event has shown my family and I, that Cesar has not only impacted our lives but others as well. I am amazed at how many have come out to visit my brother from far away, I am amazed at how many people have offered their help and prayed for us, and I am amazed at how even unconscious in a hospital bed, he has brought everyone together and has made us stronger for that. He has done so much for so many without asking anything back. He has always been a giver, a helper, a reasonable man with a huge heart, a family man, and a man of faith. It is for him that we are being strong. God brought him back to life twice, and God does not do things half way. God will make him well like before, even better. God has shown his love and power to us, and we know it will be alright in the end. I just pray for the strength to keep going down this road, for it is a long and arduous road with many obstacles that lie ahead. This has been the hardest thing I have ever gone through in my life, and I would not hesitate twice and trade places with him. So even though I may be breaking inside and the sight of him prostrated in a bed with all his fractures and tubes kills me, I am staying strong for him. He is the strongest man I know. He is my hero. ~ By Carolina Perez Due to the accident, Cesar had to undergo surgery to realign and stabilize his femur bone. In addition, he will need multiple operations to reconstruct his facial bones and teeth. He has been knocked out with so many sedatives and painkillers at the moment, so it will take a little while for him to reach full consciousness. The car is completely destroyed, and multiple bills will be piling up soon. People in these accidents typically don’t survive, and God has Cesar alive and well with us for a reason. Cesar was only coming to visit me from Atlanta, and as always, both of us were ecstatic to be seeing each other. Sometimes I wish I could have prevented this by telling him not to come down for some reason that popped up, but it was just one of those “wrong place at the wrong time” scenarios. I do not believe this was a coincidence, for I believe something immensely good will eventually come out of this. I know God has a plan for Cesar, everyone involved, his friends, and his family in the grand scheme of things. This will be a huge test for Cesar, and I’m asking, from the kindness of your hearts, to help however much you can with bills. Keep in mind, there is also his rent, utilities, card payments, and the cost of the car crash in case the person responsible won’t be able to cover it. Cesar is a fighting spirit and has impacted the lives of hundreds throughout this country and throughout other corners of the world. He is a dreamer, a believer, and a man of faith. We all just want him to bounce back from this tragedy and resume back to his civilian life as quickly as possible. Please continue keeping him in your prayers. Like I said, there are no coincidences and God is in the works of something greater. I thank you all so much, from the bottom of my heart. ~ By Chelsea Rodriguez￼ ￼ ￼Read more"

We don't know how he got the toy or where it came from, it was a Nylabone or similar and we did not buy it, our thoughts are that he must have dug it up in the yard. He now has complications that require more surgery and longer term care and his chances are not very good. Based on what our family went through last October with our Lab Cesar and his tragic death, we are praying for a good outcome for Winston. The vet bills are massive and continue to grow. (They will be over $12000 by the time he comes home). Anything you can do to help would be appreciated. If you cannot donate I totally understand, just please pray for him or send positive vibrations or whatever you think will help get him home to us and the girls.

Their move from Harford County, Maryland to the Delaware Beach area in 2016 continued their passion for wellness counseling, and group and personal training, culminating in their recent opening of their Fitness Craze studio in the Ocean View community of Bear Trap. As recently as this past November, Mel noticed some physical changes to his body that included swelling in his legs and becoming quickly fatigued during very simple exertions. After several visits to the doctor and a hospital visit, he was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. It is unknown what might have caused this to happen. Unfortunately, since that diagnosis, Mel’s condition has worsened to the point where he is not able to fully serve his clients, and is now serious enough that he must undergo a heart transplant. The next weeks and months will be filled with doctor appointments, tests, hospital stays, surgery, and recovery. While Mel’s health insurance should cover some of these expected costs, the time away from working, for both Mel and Kim, has already and will continue to be a financial hardship on their ability to pay these and their other bills. Being self-employed, there is no safety net of paid time off for either Mel or Kim. Mel and Kim have always been givers to the health and wellness of the community.

Bryan Lecy was a match to donate 60% of his liver to an old coworker and friend named John. The journey began over a year ago and on December 7, 2016 the transplant went smoothly as planned. The planned recovery time for Bryan was 5-6 weeks. All thumbs up only lasted a short time. It wasn't long after Bryan was released from the hospital that he found himself back inwith a Bile Duct Leak. One stent placed led to another stent placement on Christmas Eve. Again, Bryan thought he was back to recovery.Bryan was admitted back into the Hospital this past Saturday. The complications this time were a continued Bile Duct Leak and an infection that had moved into his lungs. Bryan endured another 5 hour surgery today to place tubes to drain his lungs and liver. He rests in ICU this evening and we are hopeful that his fever will break tomorrow and the infection can be successfully managed. In the meantime, Bryan's wife Jesse and boys Sean and Jack are eager to get their husband and dad healthy and home. Due to the complications, if the care plan and recovery go as they should, the soonest Bryan could be back to work is the end of February or beginning of March. Bryan's Short Term Disability is about to run out. This was a selfless act of Bryan to be a Live Liver Donor and a brave act for Jesse and the boys to be on board with the decision. We would like to ask for your prayers for Bryan and Jesse.

A million dollar goal would only cover $100k per person- there are many family members to cover. Please continue with support.
We are putting this togetheron behalf of Sarah Holcombe (Slavin) and her brothers John and Scott, who have lost half of their large family.
Watch Sarah'sfirst public message here: www.facebook.com/sarah.slavin.75/videos/10207925408293085/

Theirfather (on the far left) was the guest speaker at church that day;Sarah was running late. She has lost her father, mother, brother, sister-in-law (who was pregnant), four nieces and nephews, and her best friend since childhood, Tara. This means her brother John has lost his mom, dad, brother, wife, and three kids (with two more injured) in one day. Keep them all in your prayers. If we could all gather up some financial support to send this family during this devastation, it would be a blessing. This is too much to bear on their own, let's be the Church! No amount of money will ever be enough, but it can take off a large burden.
If you are unable to give in person or are too far away, please donate here: the beneficiary is Sarah. She already has immediate access to the funds and will distribute it in the way she sees fit among her remaining family: hospital bills for surviving family members (including four children), funeral costs, lost wages, airplane tickets for out of town family, counseling services, etc.

Here are some news articles:""In nearby Floresville, hours after the attack, Scott Holcombe, 30, sat with his sister on the curb outside the emergency room at Connally Memorial Medical Center. They were both in tears. Their parents, Bryan and Karla Holcombe, had been at the church and had been killed.“I’m dumbfounded,” Mr. Holcombe said. “This is unimaginable. My father was a good man and he loved to preach. He had a good heart.”His sister, Sarah Slavin, 33, added: “They weren’t afraid of death. They had a strong faith, so there’s comfort in that. I feel like my parents, especially my mom, wasn’t scared.”
""Bryan Holcombe did prison ministry; he would go to the prison with a ukulele and sing for the inmates.""
""Crystal Holcombe was killed along with three of her five children, her cousin Nick Uhlig told reporters. Holcombe’s two other children were injured, he added.""

If you’re reading this, thank you!

If you don’t know my sister personally, well first of all you’re missing out! Emeillia is a compassionate, animal whispering, intelligent and caring young lady, beautiful inside and out. She has many passions but she has been in love with animals since she was just a little tot (if we accidentally sat on her “bear bear” she would immediately come to his rescue!) Emeillia rides horses competitively and has even taken in racehorses and trained them herself. Her love for animals is truly special!

2 years ago Emeillia developed an eating disorder. She told me it began with tryingto eat healthier and get plenty of exercise. She was so happy with her results but wanted to keep losing weight. Eventuallyher illness took over. She gradually beganto lose control and become very ill mentally and physically. Looking back I can’t believe it took me so long to see what was happening.

I work in our local ER and on Friday night our registration came out to the nurses station to say there was an unresponsive 15 year old with an eating disorder at theentrance. My stomach dropped, I knew it was Meilly. She hadn’t eaten for 5 days and her blood sugar was too low to allow her brain and body to function. With two amazing nurses and a wonderful NP springing into action she finally awoke, groggy but responsive (this must have felt like hours for my mom and Greg!) She was stabilized but unable to sustain her sugars on her own. She was then taken to DHMC and admitted to the Pediatric ICU where she started receiving tube feeds.

Her recovery is going to be beyond difficult! She will likely stay in the PICU for several weeks. She has been trying to get admitted to several inpatient facilities in Boston since November, however due to the pandemic, has not been able to get a bed. She was also denied outpatient treatment from these facilities because she is too ill to be treated on an outpatient basis. We can only hope her admission to Dartmouth may push the process along faster. It’s a very challenging illness to combat.Reintroducing food has to be slow and calculated in order to avoid a potentially deadly syndrome called “refeeding syndrome.” On top of recovering the body she will require extensive psychological care.My Mom and Greg, her parents are two amazing individuals and a force to be reckoned with! They have been through so much and do not waiver. My mom will be staying with Meilly so that Greg can keep the farm animals fed and cared for. Greg will of course visit daily. My mom can only be out of work for so long because her paycheck is crucial. Due to taking a new position at the VA recently, she hasn’t built up enough PTO time to take much timeoff at all.I’m raising this money to help a little while she’s admitted at DHMC. I’m hoping this can help with gas, food, etc. Any little bit will help and be appreciated by my entire family. If you can’t afford to help, sharing this page and her story is equally appreciated ❤️

I’m also more than happy to collect cards to drop off with them! Reach out to me if you’re interested! Hugs!

The last 4 digits are 6774!Info about funds:I, Zoe Faller, started this fundraiser right after the accident to start the fundraising process to help alleviate financial stress during a difficult time. This ensured that mine and Suzie's family could focus on her surgery and recovery plan, while I could help from afar. I will continue to keep posting updates as I see them however I am handing over the reins of this GoFundMe Page to Suzie's brother David Pozzi.Much love to all!

My heart breaks for my best friend Maryanne & her family as they are currently going through the most difficult time of their lives. Please take the time to read about Lani's health situation, it would mean a lot to us if you can donate to this important & worthy cause in support of Lani & family. Every dollar big or small is actually beneficial. If you're unable to donate, your prayers are priceless and will mean the world to us.Let me introduce you to Lani Matulino, the youngest daughter of Maryanne and Fred, and baby sister to Madison and Annika. Lani started school this year as a bright and bubbly 5 year old who quickly adapted to school life (which she absolutely loved). On Wednesday 20 May 2020 while getting ready for school, Lani suffered an unexpected seizure. She was then rushed to Logan Hospital by ambulance with her worried parents by her side. From there, Lani’s illness escalated and she was transported to ICU at Queensland Children’s Hospital. Within the week, Lani was diagnosed with Anti NMDA Receptor Encephalitis, a rare illness where the body produces antibodies (usually to attack viruses) that instead attack the NMDA receptors in the brain. This in turn affects movement and autonomic functions such as breathing, swallowing etc. The causes of Anti NMDA Receptor Encephalitis are unknown but have been detailed well in an autobiography titled “Brain on Fire”, along with a 2017 Netflix movie with the same name. To add to Lani’s journey, on 29 May she required emergency surgery to remove part of her bowel due to loss of blood flow there. Then on 8 June, while attempting to remove her from the ventilator, she went into cardiac arrest where she was given CPR and was without oxygen for some time. Consequently, the medical team has confirmed that there is some brain damage which may leave Lani with a movement disorder as a result. Initially, Lani’s recovery in hospital was estimated at 9-12 months, but with the added complications of her bowel and recent cardiac arrest, Lani now has a long road of extensive therapy and rehabilitation ahead of her. Over the last few months, many family & friends have asked how they can help support Lani's family through this. This page has been created for that reason - it will help to ensure that Lani has the support she needs to get better and will also help her family manage their financial responsibilities during this difficult time while they are off work to remain by Lani's side. We would like to keep everyone updated with Lani's strength and bravery with photos and progress. Thank you so much for your love and support.Read more"

Jake, Jamie (and baby in her tummy) and their toddler son Uriel were on a short trip to their property in Okanogan, WA over the weekend. The property is deep in a rural area with no signal or communication. They were caught in the big Cold Spring Fire on Sunday, we think around midnight . Their abandoned truck was found burned, the fire chased them to the river where they are being rescued today (09/09). They have been through a traumatic incident and will need some financial support!They have been airlifted to help and all that we know as of now is that they are in bad shape.It is a true miracle of God that they were found and are alive. The whole experience they have been through is nothing short of completely horrific and traumatizing. They need your prayers!100% of donations will go to Jake and Jamie.

This is Tammie Mabry, My husband is Jakes 1st cousin.I am Jakes cousin-n-law. Jamie is a friend andcousin-n-law through marriage. I am from Maple Valley, WA and started this gofundme to help relieve the financial pressure knowing they will need every penny to care for their needs. The funds raised for Jake and Jamie will be used for living expenses, a new vehicle since it was burned in the fire, medical bills, and lack of employment due to their injuries and long road to recovery. Jake and Jamie will be added as beneficiaries.I plan to do this through gofundme by adding Jake and Jamie as the benificiaires and following the instructions on how to do that, so that they can add their bank account and get the funds directly.

THANK YOU to everyone that has given and prayed. The road to recovery is a long one andwe cannot tell you how much we appreciate you and your love for this couple as they heal!

Sam Snow, a loving husband, and father, was involved in a hit-and-run accident on March 3rd in Pearland TX. Sam had the right of way at an intersection but when he saw the driver of the pickup truck was not yielding, he swerved trying to avoid a collision. Unfortunately, Sam’s motorcycle slammed into the side of the truck causing his right leg to be crushed. The driver did not stop to assist. Luckily an off-duty police officer saw Sam lying in the road bleeding out and stopped to render aid. This saved Sam’s life.Sam had to receive multiple blood transfusions and has suffered a stroke leaving his arm paralyzed. On March 9th, due to complications and the risk of another stroke Sam made the decision to have his leg amputated below the knee. On March 11th, Sam underwent another surgery to clean his leg. The doctors have not closed it up yet as they are waiting to make sure the tissue and muscle stay healthy. Sam will soon begin physical therapy on his left arm that was affected by the stroke. Sam works at Master Services as a fireplace technician. Due to these extensive injuries, Sam will no longer be able to work in that capacity.While the length of Sam’s recovery is still very unclear, his medical expenses and need for future assistance are immense. We’ve set up this page as an avenue to not only generate some assistance for Sam and Kim but also to show Sam there are countless people out there rooting for his recovery.Kim is a close family friend of ours for over 30 years. My hope is that we can raise enough money so Sam and Kim can keep their home in Pearland and pay for medical expenses.

Hi I’m James in March 2021 I am aiming to complete 1000 miles over a period of 31-40 days on a stationary spin bike & also with the help of others do a 24hour gameathon to help raise money for the appropriate treatment & rehabilitation to help my sister make the best possible recovery.


Sarah. A 25 year old women, who in 2020 led a normal life until October 12th 2020, when a rare Neurological condition called Guillain-Barrésyndrome (GBS) attacked Sarah’ immune system, leading to emergency admission to Hospital. Sarah was put into Intensive Care at north Tees and then moved to intensive Care at James Cook hospital. In that time Guillain-Barre Syndrome attacked Sarah’s immune system which then attacked the peripheral nervous system—the network of nerves located outside of the brain and spinal cord. Sarah at the time fighting for her life with GBS affecting her brain, breathing and parts of her body.


Sarah spent 3 months in James Cook receiving extensive treatment on a daily basis in the neurological ward and ward 26. Sarah has been left with a life changing disabilities, with lower and upper body paralysis, along with changes to function of the brain and parts of the body.


Sarah is now back home relaying on a wheelchair and full time care with some adaptations to the house and daily equipment provided by occupational health to allow her to get round the house when needed.


Sarah is working hard with myself and the family with daily rehabilitation, in order to get Sarah back walking and functioning to the best she can.


We are really limited with NHS care and Physiotherapy since Sarah has been out of hospital possibly down to COVID-19, and the rarity of the condition Sarah has got which affects just 1 in a hundred thousand people, so understandably knowledge on her condition and treatment is limited.


In order for Sarah to get back fully functional, Sarah needs to be able to see specialists and have treatment and equipment which has not been provided under NHS care.


These are;- Private Neurological Specialists - Private Neurological Physio and rehabilitation centres- Hydrotherapy centres- Further Adaptations to house- Equipment not provided by NHSand most importantly Treatment:IVIG - IVIG is a treatment made from donated blood that contains healthy antibodies. These are given tohelp stop the harmful antibodies damaging your nerves.or Plasma Exchange (Plasmapheresis) - This involves being attached to a machine that removes blood from a vein and filters out the harmful antibodies that are attacking your nerves before returning the bloodto your body.Most people eventually make a full recovery from Guillain-Barré syndrome, but this can sometimes take a long time and around 1 in 5 people have long-term problems.https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/

The previous night, his nurse started to notice changes in him – he started to move his legs and even squeezed the nurse’s hand! The nurse in the morning noticed the same.

THANK YOU FURGET ME NOT ANIMAL RESCUE!!!!PUPDATE:One last Carol Danvers update just so everyone knows how much they changed this little dog’s life. I picked Carol out from the vet last Friday after a week of parvo treatment, and she was the happiest healthiest little dog this past week. She learned to sit, “go to your home” (crate training) and go for a “walk in the park” (my backyard) while she was here. She got her very own peanut butter kong with her name on it, went through three bags of puppy treats and had tons of snuggles and skritches. Yesterday she was dropped off at Furget Me Not Animal Rescue (https://fmnanimalrescue.org) and apparently fit right in. Thank you for helping Carol Danvers Get Better. If you want to check her out in full puppy mode, I posted some videos of her and Pizza here:https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMeStSfjr/You know how much I love dogs. Who doesn’t??
On Saturday, March 6th at around 1pm my dog Pizza Fox started barking LOUDLY at something outside. This was no ordinary “I hate that mailman” bark. That was the first time I saw Carol Danver’s sweet face, looking at me from the other side of my very own bedroom window.



I went right outside...but she was gone. Not long after, Pizza started barking again and I saw Carol across the road. She could barely keep her eyes open and was having trouble walking. I carried her to the backyard, where she quickly drank a whole bowl of water...and then another. By the time I realized that she maybe wasn’t just shy or scared, all the vets and shelters in the area were closed. I posted on any social media platform I could think of (Thank you Lost and Found Pets - Huntsville for all the shares!) and continued to monitor her. It soon became evident that she was not in good health. She would drink water and then go to the bathroom immediately. She didn’t eat anything for the whole time she was here and I noticed that her stomach was twitching sometimes.



My original plan was to wait until Monday when I could call the shelter and my vet but I decided to take her to the emergency vet when she seemed to decline even further. She drank water and then was sick immediately. I knew something was wrong.



X-rays confirmed she has some kind of a blockage (*UPDATE* The Emergency Vet called at 8:30pm Saturday and said she had tested positive for Parvo). They recommended keeping her there on an IV, in hopes that some fluids will help any blockage to pass and if not, she will be there just in case. This decision made me feel better than taking her home and waiting for my vet to open tomorrow. I had already been so worried about her for the past 24 hours. There was no way I would sleep tonight either way.

The cancer masses on the top of his heart and lungs, as well as a mass inside his right lung, are all contributing to extremely labored breathing and overall exhaustion.John has been ill for quite some time without an exact diagnosis from the many doctors that he has seen. As you can imagine, the COVID Pandemic is only complicating an already complicated situation. Initially, he spent a week in the Critical Care Unit, due to a blood clot in his heart and had to be shocked out of AFIB. His life is officially upside down. Some days are okay and most days are difficult. John is a hard working professional truck driver that has worked 40-60 hours a week his entire life to support his family. Cancer has now caused him financial and emotional toxicity and he can no longer work. Five months into this, his doctors have only recently begun his treatment journey.As many of you know, John is the one always helping - not the one asking for help! His family has decided to start an on-line fundraising campaign on his behalf with the hope of helping him alleviate some of the financial burden of this terrible disease.Please know, if you are hearing this news for the first time, we apologize that we haven’t reached out prior. This is a very difficult situation and we are all still processing and helping him with day to day issues, paperwork and wrapping our heads around his diagnosis. Anyone familiar with John, knows he is giving of his time to help his family, friends and even strangers. He’s a gentle soul, very humble and a wonderful human being. We would like him to focus ALL his energy on healing, recovery and following his treatment plan.As his immediate family, we have witnessed how quickly his unexpected medical expenses, life expenses and additional unexpected expenses have quickly begun to add up.As we all cope with the pandemic restrictions, we know this is a difficult time for many people. That being said, any amount you are able to donate will help him way beyond what you would image. If you are unable to donate at this time, even “sharing” this post will help spread his story. We ask you keep him and his team of doctors and nurses in your thoughts and prayers.We are grateful for each and every one of you and Thank you for being in our lives. Thank you for your ongoing support through John’s uphill battle. We will update you on his progress as much as we are able.Read more"

I’m a transmasc NB person living in the Bay Area, CA. In my personal life I write music and poetry, and I like riding my bike with my friends. I’m passionate about social causes, animals, and anything that involves food. I am currently unemployed due to COVID-19 but when I am working full time my jobs usually involve physical labor and heavy machinery. I worked in laboratory settings for a while but since last March 2020 I haven’t been able to work. The purpose of this page is to help me cover the costs of my top surgery and after care.I started wearing a binder at 19 years old in 2012. I remember when I was studying culinary arts at Le Cordon Bleu how uncomfortable it was to constantly wear an ace bandage under my uniform. My friend gave me their old full length binder after I shared with them that I was using an ace bandage. I wore it until it turned grey and was all stretched out. I’ve been binding for about 9 years now, and the effects it has taken on my chest are getting to be more trouble than buying binders for the rest of my life is worth. I am ready to take the next step to being comfortable in my body.In 2018 I started to feel like my pronouns weren’t really matching how I felt on the inside so I asked my close friends to start using him/her/they. The times they used “he” I remember feeling good inside. The times people used her/they I still felt uneasy but didn’t know how to advocate for myself to get what I needed to hear. It wasn’t until casually talking with a friend, and sharing my frustrations they asked “would you like us to use he/him from now on?” that I felt comfortable with the idea of using those pronouns solely. It hadn’t crossed my mind that that was what I really wanted the whole time.Towards the end of 2019 my mental health had been on a steady decline; my work habits were suffering, I was struggling to take proper care of myself, and I felt like I didn’t know who the real Una was. I felt like a shell of a person, just executing the tasks before me. I knew I needed guidance and serious help. I knew a change was desperately needed.After reaching out to 50+ therapists in the Bay Area, and getting denied over and over again I finally got a positive response from a therapist who specialises in LGBTQ+ clients with depression and anxiety. After speaking with her that following Monday I knew I was on the right path to helping myself. I told her I was specifically seeking out help with my gender identity and mental health issues, and she reassured me that she would be able to help me navigate this journey.I began my sessions with my therapist in January 2020, and she helped me realise what parts of my life I needed to work on and reshape. We’ve worked through some of my trauma, and she has helped guide me to where I feel comfortable in my gender expression. She sent me the resources to start testosterone therapy in April 2020. I started working with the UCSF medical team to get my HRT. I administered my first T shot on June 25th, 2020. I remember the euphoric feeling I immediately had that lasted all day into the evening. I felt so happy. I don’t think I’ve ever felt that kind of happiness in my life before that moment. I’ve given myself my injections every Thursday since that day. Now I am at the point where I am ready to have top surgery to reflect how I want to feel physically.The type of procedure I am having is very invasive, and takes more time due to my natural chest size. I will be having Double Incision which involves two large cuts on my chest to remove most of the fat, and the healing time will take up to six months. I won’t be able to lift anything over 5lbs for at least six weeks, and I won’t be able to lift my arms past my shoulders for six months. I will only be able to wear button up shirts, and I won’t be able to hold a job in the industries I usually work because of the lifting restrictions.I am nervous of course about having this procedure. I’ve never gone under in any medical setting or needed surgery. I am excited though to see what I will look like afterwards, and the endless possibilities of physical activities that will become available to me because I didn’t feel comfortable before. One of my most exciting adventures I can’t wait to experience is the first bike ride I will have where I can ride without a shirt on. I am also eager to sunbathe for the first time with the sun hitting my bare skin. Right now with my chest the way it is I am constantly uncomfortable and frustrated. My mind wants to focus on the activity I am involved in but my chest is the focus. The feeling of sweat on my chest especially irritates me, and having to constantly readjust my binder gets in the way of doing most things.Binding for a long time has its own issues. Typically I wear my binder for 12+ hours out of the day, and the discomfort it brings lasts longer. I find myself taking deep breaths often, and I’ve had upper back and shoulder pain for years. Some days I find small bruises on my shoulders where the straps rest all day.Truly I can’t wait for the day that I feel comfortable in my body. I know it will still take time to get to the point of being content but this is an important step in the right direction. With the changes I’ve experienced after starting T I have been much happier. For example because my voice has now gotten to a deeper pitch I get gendered correctly by most strangers. It feels so relieving to get people to recognise my pronouns before I get the chance to tell them.The date of my surgery is scheduled for the 14th of October. This date didn’t originally hold any special meaning to me until I remembered it was the day my partner first told me she loved me. When the date was available I knew I had to take it. She will be there to take care of me, and help me during the moments that I need assistance. I am truly blessed to not only have her but my parents and close friends to help me in my recovery period. I am proud of the person I am becoming, and I can’t wait to see the final result of my chest when it is healed. I am excited and scared but ready for the future.Aside from the pandemic being a brutal blow to the entire world, right now is the perfect time for a lot of trans people to take advantage of the world being “closed”. I’ve noticed quite a few people who are taking the opportunity to start HRT or have gender affirming surgeries. I would like to take this time for my transition because I think it would feel great to go back into the world when we can do so safely again with the reflection of how I feel on the inside on the outside as well. I also can’t wait to start my next job without having to explain my gender expression or pronouns to my employer. If I can re-enter the workplace looking/sounding how I want it would be a huge relief.Before making this page I had a major internal conflict; who am I to ask my comrades for money when I know we are all struggling? When I bring this issue up to my friends they always respond with the same sentiment: this is how a lot of people are paying for medical bills unfortunately. It isn’t right but due to the broken system we live in, this is how a lot of trans people have to cover their gender affirmation surgeries. Crowdfunding for medical expenses is obviously not a long term solution, and it’s an ugly side effect of capitalism. I appreciate any help I can receive from friends/family/strangers for this procedure.Here is what the donations will be paying for:Surgery: $7,000 Rent x3: $1700After Care Supplies and Medication:$300Time off Work: $1,000Total: $10,000Any amount raised over the donation request will go towards after care costs, and any funds left over post healing will be donated to The Transgender District SF.I know this surgery isn’t going to fix everything in my life but it isn’t necessarily about “fixing” my issues, it is about how comfortable I will feel in my body. My mind will be able to stop focusing on my appearance, and how my chest feels touching itself or my clothes. I won’t feel itchy or restricted under a binder. I won’t have to readjust my chest or buy a new binder every six months or so because the last one started to stretch out/unthread itself. I will be able to move freely. Activities cis gendered people take for granted will be available to me. Little things like opening my arms for a hug, bending over to pick something up, settling my guitar to start playing… these actions are so calculated for me. I want to live in a way that doesn’t have to be so methodical and thought out. It would be nice to just be myself.Any amount received in this donation would mean a lot to me. I’ve taken a great amount of time to consider taking this next step in my life, and I’ve spent many years suffering in my own skin. This surgery means everything to me, and it would be life changing. I am fortunate enough to live near Dr. Mosser’s surgery center. He is one of the best gender affirmation surgeons in California, and I am very excited to have him operate on me. He is a surgeon many before me have trusted, and while I am nervous to be under the knife I am also excited.I am blessed to have supportive friends I am staying with, and my amazing and beautiful partner to help take care of me. I don’t think there will be a better opportunity or moment for me to do this in my life. As I mentioned before many trans people are taking this time to get to where they want to be in their transition.I will be sharing a personal poem/song :)Please feel free to share this page on any platform or within your personal pages/circles. Thank you for taking the time to read about who I am, and where I am in my transition. Have a great day.Read more"

My mother was my best friend and my hero. My nephew was the light of my life. My mother was the sole provider of our household. Now that she is no longer here, I’m asking for any help towards the bills that my mom has left for me to take over. I’m unable to work until my injuries heal. Anything will be appreciated. I’m asking to be able to keep a roof over my head while I’m in recovery and dealing with this great loss in my life. This tragedy is something that I have to deal with mentally and emotionally at the expense of someone else’s careless decision to drink and drive.

Eddie and Amanda, Boone’s hero’s, made the decision to follow through with a very expensive surgery to fix Boone’s leg that is broken in 3 places. These two would never ask for anything and are two of the kindest people I have ever met. Please, if you have anything to give, let’s help relieve the financial burden for Eddie and Amanda. These two have given Boone the absolute best life, and his story is just beginning. In addition, please pray for Boone’s surgery to go well and for him to make a fast recovery. Donations may also be made directly to Boone's account at Willow Creek Vet Clinic in Pierce, NE.*Boone's StoryRemember this sweet face? The sweet, 3-year-old black lab who was confined to a kennel for 3 years of his life. His previous owners would get called in to authorities because of his barking, to which they “resolved” by placing a bark collar on him that would shock him every time he would make the slightest bark. This nasty bark collar left permanent burn marks on the back neck. Thankfully, a very courageous neighbor messaged me during the historical floods in 2019, about a dog next door and how the water from the flood was overtaking his kennel. I promptly notified authorities, and they did a welfare check on the dog. A few days later, the neighbor informed me that the dog’s owners were looking for a new home for him and had tried posting it in the newspaper, but nobody had contacted them so they didn’t know what to do. They simply did not want this dog anymore. One day while walking with my mom and daughter, I decided we should stop and knock on the door to meet his owners and talk to them about the possibility of re-homing their black lab. After just a few minutes of talking with them, I asked if I could meet their dog. When we reached his kennel he began to growl, he wasn’t used to other people approaching his kennel—only his owners who came out to feed him twice a day. His kennel was caked in feces, and his fur the same. It made my heart break in a million pieces. As soon as he was out of the kennel (on a leash at this point), I knelt down for him to sniff me. He wasn’t quite sure at first, but I could tell right away that he had the sweetest little personality and longed to just be loved on. Since I had my daughter with me, and the dog was on a leash, I let him approach her stroller carefully. It was evident that he loved children, even though he had never been around them. He was very careful with my daughter, and she quickly fell in love with him. I took a few pictures and videos of him and posted his info on my Facebook page. *Enter his Angel’sA friend of mine I went to High School with, Eddie, contacted me almost immediately after I posted the pictures and videos of this lab on my Facebook. He lives on a farm, has another lab named Yogi, and a very sweet girlfriend (now fiancé) named Amanda, who also loves dogs. I thought PERFECT, this could not be a better match. He wanted to meet this lab so we scheduled a time the next day for him to come to my house and meet him. That next day I drove over to the dogs home and tried to coax him into my car with a pan of fresh turkey, to which he completely denied and refused to get in my car. Since I couldn’t get him in the car, I decided I would take him by leash and just walk him to my house. It was raining and a bit chilly out, but he didn’t care! This pup could not have been more excited to go on a walk. He was smelling everything and moving at a lightning pace. (I guess this was more like a run than a walk) We finally reached my house, and I tried everything to get him through my fence gate. He was utterly terrified of being confined—which I couldn’t blame him at all. He just wanted to be free. I got my husband to come and sit with him in the garage to wait for Eddie to come meet him. After arriving at my house and meeting this pup, Eddie promptly agreed to take him in. Fast-forward a couple of days, and this pup, now named Boone, took a ride in my car to his furever home! *Taken from Eddie’s mom’s Facebook postThis is where ""Boone's"" life began. On the farm, Eddie & Amanda taught him to walk (something he didn't know how to do, as he had never been out of his kennel), run, swim, hunt & just be a dog. Most importantly, for the 1st time in his 3 years of life, they taught him what love was. He had permanent burn marks on his neck (from his shock/ bark collar) & he was scared of people, particularly men. Through Eddie & Amanda's patience & love, he's learned to trust people again, and has become a great dog. Tonight, ""Boone"" is in the fight of his life again, after being accidentally struck by a car on the farm, the home he has grown to know & love.”Eddie and Amanda, Boone’s hero’s, made the decision to follow through with the very expensive surgery to fix Boone’s leg that is broken in 3 places. Again, These two would never ask for anything and are two of the kindest people I have ever met. Please, if you have anything to give, let’s help relieve the financial burden for Eddie and Amanda.

The Accident

My friend Cathy Harper’s (of Middletown, NY) 24 year old daughter (Shyla Hayes, living in Hooksett, NH) has been in a horrible car accident. She was driving to work on a windy Saturday in March and her little Yaris flipped on the highway. She was pulled from the car and rushed to the hospital. Cathy got in her car to drive the 4 hours to the hospital in Nashua, New Hampshire. The article on the accident can be seen here:https://www.google.com/amp/s/patch.com/new-hampshire/bedford-nh/amp/29342285/vehicle-crosses-i-293-median-rolls-over-trapping-driver-in-car



Update

The doctors determined Shyla’s back has been fractured in three places and her lungs are bruised. They are not saying how long the recovery process will be as of yet.



The Expenses

As many young people, Shyla, not thinking of what could happen, was underinsured. This means there will be medical expenses, expenses for towing, missed work, a totaled car, and the family are currently incurring expenses to stay near the hospital.

Request for Help

Shyla and her family need help from their community to pay these expenses.If you are able please make a contribution, however small. Please share this plea in your online media feeds. Thank you so much for coming together as a community to help a young woman and her family in crisis.

This is the guy who would not only give you the shirt off of his back, but will also give you a swift kick in the rear if needed. His bonds to the Ithaca community run deep and true.  Unforunately, not many know of the ongoing battle he has been fighting for quite some time now. In 2016 Lippy was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Most of us cannot even imagine what a diagnosis like that might feel like but in typical Lippy fashion, our boy stood tall and fought his way through it. After rounds of chemo and a six hour surgery to remove lymph nodes in his belly, he slowly recovered and started becoming his jovial self once again. He couldnt eat as much pizza as he would have liked, but promised us all that when he could, we would have the biggest pizza party ever! Sadly, in the spring of 2017 he was back in the mean old grips of cancer. His team of doctors recommended a stem cell bone morrow transplant and chemo thereapy, and not just once, but two rounds of this procedure.     During his first round of chemo in 2016, Lippy experienced a significant loss of hearing and since being hospitalized most recently his hearing has become even worse. Once his final round of chemo therapy is done he is expecting his hearing to be almost completely gone. This will mean more doctors and possible hearing aids.Throughout all of this, he continues to smile and take care of the people he loves in any way he possibly can. Luckily, this brave dude doesnt go down without a fight. It isnt,however, a fight he should be fighting alone.  Below is a brief synopsis of what exactly it is he has been dealing with in more technical terms. written out by his father who I admire dearly and who understands these things a little better than I.  Spring 2016 Chris experienced a lot of back pain that would not stop. ER visit showed a tumor on the testicle. Blood test determined what bio markers the tumor was making which help specify the exact diagnosis telling DR Campbell what treatment was needed. The appropriate surgery was done. Treatment was started in April thru June with 4 rounds of week long infusions. The bio Markers went down indicating a treatment response. Follow up visits with Dr Julie Campbell later that summer recommended a visit with DR.Levine at Roswell and Dr Schwaab. The visit and guidance of national treatment standards recommended a technical surgery of the Lymph nodes in the belly which Dr Schwaab did in fall. Delicately Chris responded to a recovery that limited things he could do. Follow up indicated markers went down indicating a response. At a routine follow up visits at Dr Julie Campbell a slight increase in the markers appeared in late spring/ early summer.A repeat visit after that showed increase continuance. A visit to Dr McCarthy ( Stem cell expert) at Roswell was suggested. The Therapy that was recommended for Chris was 2 cycles of high dose chem therapy with stem cell support from Chris,s own blood. The hi dose Chemo is given for 3 days in a row as an inpatient. After these infusions 3 plus days are waited. At that time Chris's own stem cell ( the building block for red cells - for energy ,white cells to prevent infection and platelets that prevent/ stop bleeding) are introduced back to him. The stem cells will become in-bedded and do there stem cell jobs as described.This cycle is repeated one more time. Chris needs to stay within 45 minutes of his Buffalo hospital for 2 weeks after hospital discharge. Numerous precautions ( food to eat, animal environment mold exposure) to prevent infection need to be used for 3 to 6 months after he finishes the treatments. Release to work will not be given until this recovery time is completed.                         .............. Its going to take a long time for Lippy to get back on his feet. I personally have all the faith in the world that he is going to come back from this with more super powers than ever, but that wont really help with the financial toll this disease will take. Anything at all helps. Both Lippy and his family appreciate even your warm thoughts. But lets get this guy ready and set to take over the world. Lippy is currently staying in the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo NY. You can find further information on the hospital athttps://www.roswellpark.org/  For every donation given, we will send out bracelets designed by Lippy himself for cancer awareness. They are also available to purchase.We would love to hear any fun experiences you've had with Lippy in the comments below. Spread the love and definitely the laughs. It is what keep him going.We love your guts, friends....once again, cancer sucksbut our community doesntlets kick its buttWE LOVE YOU LIPPY!!!Read more"

This young man’s immune system was further compromised as sepsis set in. The ensuing toxic shock syndrome complicated his diagnosis and nearly took his young life but physicians were able to help the boy through that portion of his experience. Nonetheless, the severity of Beauden’s situation has resulted in a prognosis of double leg amputation and possibly both hands as well.As you might imagine, this beautiful family has been literally crushed by these events. Aside from having most of the facets of a young boys life stripped from their hands, they are faced with an uphill battle with insurance, recovery, ancillary care, and the likelihood of counseling for them all… The family is of the state of mind that family matters are to remain private. But, as a human being that has lived a good spell in this world, I know their new path through life is about to get extremely complicated, frustrating and exceedingly emotional. 

All of this is new territory, including the utilization of this platform...that said, the financial goal that was set was arbitrarily set by me.  We all know that in todays world it ultimately amounts to very little indeed. Keep Beauden in your prayers please....

News quickly reached Amanda’s husband, Christopher, a military serviceman who is currently deployed with the Army over 6,000 miles away in the Middle East. After surveying the damage, the family is now displaced from their home for the foreseeable future because of the damage left behind from the flood and mold infestation. The Wright Family home is connected to Amanda’s family’s construction business, which also suffered significant damage and loss of equipment. A Civil Servant Family Chris is a Trooper with the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) and a Chief Warrant Officer in the United States Army/ Pennsylvania Army National Guard. In January 2018, Chris deployed to the Middle East. While Chris has been serving oversees, Amanda has been single handedly running the household, taking care of the home and caring for their five children. Madison (13), Caden (11), Isabella (10), Alaina (6) and Gabrielle (4) are tremendously active children, who are involved in soccer, baseball, cross country and with their church. The family is extremely close to Amanda’s parents, Kent and Janie Cooper, who live locally. The Cooper’s run a construction business out of a warehouse they own in Port Carbon, which is connected to Amanda and Chris’ home. A Heavy Rainfall After a Summer of already record-breaking rainfall, in mid-August 2018, Schuylkill County (located in northeastern Pennsylvania, north of Harrisburg) received heavy rainfalls that overflowed the area waterways, including the Schuylkill Rivers and Mill Creek. The waters flooded the streets of the town of Port Carbon, flowing heavily between the homes. You can find local news coverage of the flooding here.The Wright family home and the connected warehouse was surrounded by the mucky flood waters. The waters entered the warehouse, flooding out and ruining some of the equipment. The family home’s foundation was submerged by the waters, causing severe damage and mold to the structure of the home. The flood waters were contaminated with sewage, oil, gas and kerosene.Because of the location of the home, the property was not suitable for flood insurance. The family is now forced to move out of the home that they have resided in for almost a decade with no forecast of aid from insurance. How to Help Any financial assistance the Wright Family can attain will help them rebuild a place for them to live. Currently the family is moving out any of their belongings that they can salvage and moving in with Kent and Janie, who also suffered financially by the loss of their company’s equipment. As of now, the family believes that the home is not able to be saved because of the extent of damage. Therefore, they have lost their home, with no way to repair it and seeking options to find a permanent home for the family of seven. #SaveWrightFamilyHomePlease share the Wright Family’s story with your friends and family, and share the link to this campaign on your social media channels. Any help we can receive for this loving family who serves and protects so many others is truly appreciated, as now is a time that they need to be served and protected. Thank you for the kindness.

Nach einer ersten Chemotherapie in der Mongolei ging es ihr zunächst besser – doch leider erlitt die kleine Saran im Januar 2021 einen Rückfall und wird nun mit einer weiteren Chemotherapie behandelt. Sie hat gerade die Phase 1 abgeschlossen.Um zu Überleben braucht Saran im Anschluss an die Chemotherapie Phase 2 dringend eine Knochenmarktransplantation (KMT) mit vorgeschalteter hochdosierter Chemotherapie.Saran lebt in der Mongolei, wo leider aufgrund des rückständigen Gesundheitssystems keine Knochenmarktransplantation durchgeführt werden kann. Daher ist sie auf eine Knochenmarktransplantation im Ausland angewiesen, was die mongolische Krankenversicherung nicht abdeckt. Deutsche Ärzte haben Saran‘s Zustand aus der Ferne bewertet und bestätigen, dass sie mit einer Knochenmarktransplantation überleben kann. Läuft die Phase 2 der jetzigen Chemotherapie gut, muss sie nach Deutschland um die Untersuchungen für die Spendersuche, Deine hochdosierte Chemotherapie und folgend die KMT zu machen. Um die Kosten für die Behandlung in Deutschland zu decken werden 450.000 EUR benötigt! Wer ist Saran? Saran ist ein sehr lebensfrohes freundliches Mädchen. Sie geht in die 5te Klasse. Seit sie wegen der schweren Krankheit nicht mehr in die Schule gehen kann fehlt sie ihren Freunden, Schulkameraden und Lehrern sehr. Bevor sie krank wurde, war Saran ein sehr glückliches Kind. Sie lächelte immer, hatte Spaß und spielte mit ihren Freunden. Sie träumt davon, eine berühmte Designerin und Sängerin zu werden. Als sie wegen einer Nasenblutung ins Krankenhaus kam, hat ihre Familie wirklich nicht geahnt, dass es sich um so eine schlimme Krankheit handelt. Die Ärztin sagte, dass Saran wegen der Nasenblutung zu viel Blut verloren hat und dass sie nach einer Bluttransfusion nach einem Tag wieder nach Hause dürfe. Und dann am nächsten Tag, kam die schockierende Nachricht. Seit Saran im vergangenen Jahr ins Krankenhaus eingeliefert wurde, lebt ihre Familie in ständiger Angst, Furcht und Sorge. Zuhause sitzen wir in tiefer Still, wenn die lebensfrohe Saran, nicht da ist. In den vergangenen 12 Monate hat die Familie an keinem einzigen Tag durchatmen können, sie beten, dass Saran wieder gesund wird. Saran selbst hat ein ganzes Jahr ununterbrochen im Krankenhaus verbracht. Sie weint still, wenn sie Kinderschreie und Lachen durch das Fenster im Krankenhaus hört. Saran verbringt ihre Tage mit der großen Hoffnung, dass sie eines Tages vollkommen gesund wird und wie ein normales Kind wieder draußen spielen und lachen kann.Woher kennen wir Saran?Saran’s Vater Enkh-Amgalan (Amaa) ist ein guter Kollege aus unserer Arbeit für die Deutsch-Mongolische Entwicklungszusammenarbeit in Ulaanbaatar. Temuulen (Timo) Ayush, Cousin von Saran, ist auch Teil des Spendenteams. Saran’s Krankheitsverlauf hat uns tief getroffen – Ihr Schicksal hängt davon ab, dass wir das Geld zusammen bekommen für die Behandlung in Deutschland.Wofür braucht es das Geld?- Flug nach Deutschland für sie und einen Familienangehörigen und zurück (ca 2500 EUR)- Hochdosierte Chemotherapie und KMT Vorbereitung mit Spendersuche (mind. 100.000 EUR je nach Verlauf eher mehr)- Knochenmarktransplantation (mind. 250.000 EUR je nach Verlauf eher mehr)- weitere Medikamente im Verlauf der Behandlung und NachbehandlungDie Ärzte empfehlen die Spendensumme auf mindestens 450.000 EUR anzulegen, so dass Kosten je nach Verlauf gedeckt werden können.Warum kann sie nicht in der Mongolei behandelt werden?Die Mongolei hat kein klassisches Gesundheitssystem. Im Krankheitsfall zahlt die Versicherung nur einen kleinen Teil der Behandlungskosten, und der Rest bzw. der größte Teil der Kosten wird von den Bürgern selbst getragen. Aufgrund des Mangels an spezialisierten Ärzten und medizinischen Geräten sowie Krankenhäusern in der Mongolei haben schwerkranke Menschen keine andere Wahl, als auf eigene Kosten ins Ausland zu reisen, um ihr Leben zu retten.Bitte helfen Sie Saran!Die gesammelten Spenden werden vollständig für die notwendige medizinische Behandlung von Saran an ihrer Familie über Temuulen Ayush gegeben. Sollte das gesammelte Geld nicht voll für die notwendigen Behandlungen verausgabt werden oder gar unerwartet tragisch enden, wird das Geld an eine mongolische Kinderkrebshilfe-Organisation gegeben, um anderen krebskranken Kindern zu helfen.----Dear GoFundMe community,Saran was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (L1) in February 2020. After an initial course of chemotherapy in Mongolia, she initially got better - but unfortunately, little Saran suffered a relapse in January 2021 and is now being treated with another course of chemotherapy. She has just completed phase 1. To survive, Saran urgently needs a bone marrow transplant (BMT) with upstream high-dose chemotherapy following chemotherapy phase 2.Saran lives in Mongolia where, unfortunately, bone marrow transplantation cannot be performed due to the underdeveloped healthcare system. Therefore, she is dependent on a bone marrow transplant abroad, which is not covered by Mongolian health insurance.German doctors have remotely assessed Saran's condition and confirm that she can survive with a bone marrow transplant. If phase 2 of the current chemotherapy goes well, she will have to go to Germany for the tests to find a donor, receive high-dose chemotherapy, and then have the BMT. To cover the costs for the treatment in Germany 450.000 EUR are needed!Who is Saran?Saran is a very cheerful and friendly girl. She is in 5th grade. Since she can no longer go to school because of the serious illness, she misses her friends, classmates and teachers very much. Before she got sick, Saran was a very happy child. She was always smiling, having fun and playing with her friends. She dreamed of becoming a famous designer and singer.When she went to the hospital for a nosebleed, her family really didn't suspect that it was such a bad disease. The doctor said that Saran lost too much blood because of the nosebleed and that after a blood transfusion, she would be allowed to go home after one day. And then the next day, came the shocking news.Since Saran was hospitalized last year, her family has lived in constant fear, anxiety and worry. At home, we sit in deep silence when fun-loving Saran, is not around. In the past 12 months, the family has not been able to breathe a single day, praying that Saran will recover. Saran herself has spent an entire year continuously in the hospital. She cries silently when she hears children's cries and laughter through the hospital window. Saran spends her days with great hope that one day she will make a full recovery and be able to play and laugh outside again like a normal child.How do we know Saran?Saran's father is a good colleague from our work for the German-Mongolian Development Cooperation in Ulaanbaatar. Saran's illness has affected us deeply - her fate depends on us getting the money together for her treatment in Germany.What do you need the money for?· Flight to Germany for her and a family member and back (about 2500 EUR)· High-dose chemotherapy and BMT preparation with donor search (at least 100,000 EUR depending on the course of the disease, likely more)· Bone marrow transplantation (at least 250,000 EUR depending on the course of treatment, likely more)· further medication in the course of treatment and aftercareThe doctors recommend that the donation amount should be at least 450.000 EUR, so that costs can be covered depending on the course of treatment. Why can't she be treated in Mongolia?Mongolia does not have a classical health care system. In case of illness, the insurance pays only a small part of the treatment costs, and the rest or most of the costs are paid by the citizens themselves. Due to the lack of specialized doctors and medical equipment and hospitals in Mongolia, seriously ill people have no choice but to travel abroad at their own expense to save their lives.Please help Saran!The collected donations will be completely given to her family for the necessary medical treatment of Saran. If the money collected is not fully spent on the necessary treatments or even ends unexpectedly tragically, the money will be given to Mongolian children's cancer support organization to help other children with cancer.----Chère communauté GoFundMe,Il a été diagnostiqué à Saran uneleucémie lymphoblastique aiguë (LAL)en février2020. Après une première chimiothérapie en Mongolie, l’état de Saran s’est initialement amélioré, avant une rechute en janvier2021. Saran suit actuellement une seconde chimiothérapie dont elle vient de terminer le premier cycle. Pour survivre, Saran a besoin de toute urgence d’une greffe de moelle osseuse, avec une chimiothérapie à forte dose en amont, après le deuxième cycle de la chimiothérapie actuelle.Saran vit en Mongolie où la transplantation de moelle osseuse ne peut malheureusement pas être pratiquée en raison du système de santé sous-développé. Elle a donc besoin de se rendre à l’étranger pour recevoir une greffe de moelle osseuse, ce qui n’est pas couvert par l’assurance maladie mongole.Les médecins allemands de Saran ont évalué à distance son état et confirment qu’une greffe de moelle osseuse lui permettrait de survivre. Si le deuxième cycle de la chimiothérapie actuelle se passe bien, elle devra ensuite se rendre en Allemagne pour effectuer les tests qui lui permettront de trouver un donneur, suivre une chimiothérapie à forte dose, puis recevoir une greffe de moelle osseuse. Le coût du traitement en allemagne s’élève à 450000€!Qui est Saran?Saran est une petite fille enjouée et sociable. Elle est en CM2, mais elle est trop gravement malade pour aller à l’école, et ses camarades de classe et ses professeurs lui manquent beaucoup. Avant de tomber malade, Saran était une enfant très heureuse. Elle souriait tout le temps, aimait s’amuser et jouait avec ses amis. Elle rêvait de devenir connue comme styliste ou comme chanteuse.Un jour, ses parents l’ont emmenée à l’hôpital parce qu’elle saignait du nez, sans se douter que la cause était si grave. Le médecin a annoncé que Saran avait perdu trop de sang et qu’elle devrait recevoir une transfusion sanguine avant de rentrer chez elle. Le lendemain, ils ont appris la terrible nouvelle.Depuis l’hospitalisation de Saran l’année dernière, sa famille vit constamment dans la peur et l’anxiété. À la maison, un silence pesant règne quand Saran, qui adore s’amuser, n’est pas là. La famille n’a pas pu souffler au cours des douze derniers mois et prie constamment pour le rétablissement de Saran. La fillette a passé toute l’année à l’hôpital, sans interruption. Elle pleure en silence quand elle entend les cris et les rires des enfants de l’autre côté de la fenêtre de l’hôpital. Saran entretient l’espoir de se rétablir complètement et de pouvoir de nouveau jouer dehors et rire comme les autres enfants.Comment connaissons-nous Saran?Le père de Saran est notre collègue de travail dans le cadre de la Coopération germano-mongole pour le développement à Oulan-Bator. La maladie de Saran nous a profondément touchés. Elle a besoin de nous pour réunir l’argent nécessaire pour son traitement en Allemagne.À quoi va servir l’argent?· Vol aller-retour vers l’Allemagne pour elle et un membre de sa famille (environ 2500EUR)· Chimiothérapie à forte dose et préparation à la greffe de moelle osseuse (au moins 100000EUR en fonction de l’évolution de la maladie, probablement plus)· Greffe de moelle osseuse (au moins 250000EUR en fonction de l’évolution du traitement, probablement plus)· Autres traitements, et suiviLes médecins ont recommandé un don d’au moins 450000EUR, afin de pouvoir couvrir les frais, quelle que soit l’évolution du traitement.Pourquoi ne peut-elle pas être soignée en Mongolie?La Mongolie n’a pas de système de santé à proprement parler. En cas de maladie, l’assurance ne prend en charge qu’une petite partie des frais pour le traitement, le reste—ou la majeure partie—étant pris en charge par les citoyens eux-mêmes. En raison du manque de médecins spécialisés, de matériel médical et d’hôpitaux en Mongolie, les personnes grièvement malades sont obligées de se rendre à l’étranger à leurs frais pour sauver leur vie.Aidez Saran, s’il vous plaît!Les dons collectés seront entièrement reversés à la famille de Saran pour financer le traitement de la fillette. Si l’argent collecté n’est pas dépensé dans sa totalité, ou en cas d’issue tragique, la somme restante sera versée à l’organisation mongole de lutte contre les cancers pédiatriques, afin de venir en aide à d’autres enfants atteints de cancer.Read more"

She’s a good listener and counselor to all her friends and family and is quick to make friends with her infectious smile and spirit. Despite all the challenges she has encountered in her life, we have never once heard her complain. Unfortunately, in February of this year our mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. Hopefully it was caught early, and with medical treatment we pray for a full recovery. As you can imagine, this has come as a major shock to us all. This unexpected news has been very difficult for our mom and our family, including financially as medical costs in the United States are extremely expensive, and even with insurance the deductible and out of pocket is high.To make things even more challenging, our dad’s position at his employer was suddenly eliminated in July of 2020 due to the effects of Covid-19. He has been very busy applying for positions and interviewing with many companies since then, but he has not been able to secure a new good paying job, yet. As he continues to search, our mom has taken on various extra jobs to help support the family. However, with the cancer treatments and hospital visits, bills are adding up fast and financial resources are quickly disappearing. On top of that, while our mom goes through the required medical procedures, treatment, and recovery process, she will have to take substantial time off work, which will basically bring any income to a halt. Our family has always tried to be as self-reliant as we can despite the unforeseen challenges of life, and it is very humbling and difficult to ask for help. However, this unexpected situation has left us little choice but to reach out to the kindness of others and ask for any financial help people are willing and able to contribute to off-set medical costs.

He's had a hard life and sadly without treatment, it will continue getting harder. Duncan has a hereditary bone and cartilage disorder called Osteochondrodysplasia and shockingly-- he doesn't have it by accident. More on that later.So you might be wondering how we came to have Duncan in our home. Like our last medical foster, Harriet the French Bulldog puppy*, I found Duncan via craigslist. He was being offered for free because his current owners were moving AND having a baby AND couldn't afford him *insert eye roll here*. They admitted that this was at least his 3rd rehoming and he had NEVER been to the vet despite his obvious medical issues. Yikes.The craigslist ad mentioned that he had a problem with his back legs, but that it ""didn't seem to bother him."" A quick google search of Scottish Fold cats with leg problems informed me that the nasty condition osteochondrodysplasia was likely the culprit. I call it a nasty disease, not just because of how painful and serious it is, but also because it is a 100% preventable condition that is PURPOSEFULLY bred into cats to create those ""cute"" folded ears popularized by celebrities and pop culture. The gene that causes the cartilage to fold also results in varying degrees of devastating osteoarthritis elsewhere in the body. All fold-ear cats have this condition, but some worse than others. Poor Duncan is severely affected. Probably because his breeder was extra greedy or extra ignorant and bred two fold-ear cats which means he has two copies of the offending gene. This devastating condition would be eliminated if people stopped breeding fold-ear cats.More info on OsteochondrodysplasiaAlright enough about his condition, because I could talk about that all day (but isn't that wild though?! What an incredibly selfish and indefensible thing for humans to create this breed where EVERY cat will eventually suffer?!) Ok back to Duncan... Despite learning about what his condition might be, I was undeterred and followed through with picking him up. I guess I figured that other people would only be interested in him for breeding or for those damn ""cute"" folded ears, when really this poor guy needed to get to a veterinarian as soon as possible. And boy oh boy did we go to the vet. I think Duncan has been to the vet at least 6 times since I brought him home on December 20, 2019. Oh and by the way, he didn't have a name... So while I held him close at his first vet appointment and we discussed his grave prognosis and the possibility of euthanasia to end his suffering--I decided to call him Duncan, a Scottish name meaning dark-haired warrior. But at the time, I had no idea what a warrior he would turn out to be!X-rays showed he was severely affected by Osteochondrodysplasia. His hind legs and feet are the worst, but his tail and elbows have lesions as well. You don't need to have a veterinary degree to recognize the problem on his x-rays. Where there should be clear, smooth, long bones--Duncan has wide, thick, and crowded bones. His joints are fusing. His vet was understandably pessimistic. At just 9 months old, Duncan was already experiencing serious pain and this would progress until eventually he wouldn't have any quality of life at all. I promised Duncan that I wouldn't let him suffer, but then I respectfully told his vet that we were going to give him a chance. Since he had never been treated, I was hopeful that he would improve with pain management and arthritis treatment. And improve he did! Our little warrior started playing, running, and sometimes even jumping! The vets were shocked. He even overcame Feline Leukemia Virus--which if you aren't familiar, is another devastating disease. And if you are familiar--Duncan was initially weakly FeLV positive on a snap test, but we got him healthy and he retested negative on snap and PCR 6 weeks later. Some cats are able to abort the virus and Duncan is one of them! He got all his vaccines, gained weight, and was neutered. This is usually the point when we'd be trying to get our foster into their forever home. But to my dismay, he had no serious interest. Tons of ""if I lived closer""s and ""I wish""s and of course the inevitable ""why don't you just keep him?""s. But no one wanted to adopt Duncan...I can't say he's perfect. He limps. He needs medication. Sometimes he snores. He needs pet stairs to get up on the bed. He gets tired after just 15 minutes of playtime. But oh man is he sweet! He lives for belly rubs. He stretches alllll the way out to give you belly access. He is chatty. He will announce himself when he enters a room or when he goes out to the catio. We joke that he's saying ""Hello World! It's me, Duncan. I'm still here!"" He's still here. Still here. But we don't know for how much longer. When I saw his x-rays I accepted that Duncan would live a short life. Short and difficult. Painful even. The anti-inflammatory medication that is keeping his pain at bay is not recommended in cats. It's very likely that it will cause fatal damage to his kidneys. And it isn't working very well. He limps with every step. He cries out if you touch his back feet. They're twisted and swollen. New, arthritic bone is growing in them and he feels every bit of it. But he still plays! Still cuddles. Still tries to do all the cat things. And his little kitten brain is constantly fighting against the limits of his damaged body. So is this when we give up on him? Put him down? Maybe.But here's the thing. Duncan has a chance at a pain-free life! I came across a paper from a vet school in Japan. Doctors successfully eliminated pain in 3 Scottish Fold cats with Duncan's condition. Using radiation therapy, these cats now live pain-free and are no longer on dangerous pain medications. The cats were followed for 5 years and experience no side effects. It's still considered an experimental procedure. It hasn't been done many times, most likely due to cost...I shared this paper with Duncan's vet and he was excited to move forward. We were referred to the UC Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital Oncology Service. Fortunately, I work at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine and I get a 20% discount (which is why I am able to take on medical fosters like this). Duncan had his consult last week. We repeated his x-rays and bloodwork. And the doctors at the VMTH are excited to take his case on. It's the best vet school in the country and I'm thrilled that Duncan has a chance to be treated there.Japanese Case Report: Efficacy and Complications of Palliative Irradiation in Three Scottish Fold Cats with OsteochondrodysplasiaDuncan will need a series of 6 radiation treatments. They would treat his hind legs, feet, tail, and elbows. He would be anesthetized for this. The total treatment series takes place over two weeks. We would expect to see results in a month. With his pain managed, he could come off the dangerous anti-inflammatory medication. He could run, jump, and just be a cat! Pain-free. He probably hasn't been pain-free since he was a tiny kitten. Looking at my family's healthy, able-bodied cats, I find it even harder to watch Duncan struggle. We are beyond excited about this treatment possibility for our little warrior. With the treatment, we would expect him to live comfortably for AT LEAST 5 years (the study only followed the treated cats for this duration). He could run and play without pain. It is very likely that he could have a normal life span. Without the treatment, we think Duncan may have a few more months, maybe a year. We just don't know. Some of his toes are twisting and becoming more painful. And even though I've fallen in love with him and want him to live a long, happy life--I haven't forgotten the promise I made to him at that first vet appointment: ""I won't let you suffer.""$4000 is the largest sum that I've ever tried to raise. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried or intimidated. But I know that YEARS of a happy life for Duncan is worth it. He is worth it. And his treatment will be documented in order to help other cats!If 200 people each donated $20, Duncan could start radiation treatment tomorrow. If you can't afford $20, I completely understand and please know that we still appreciate any contribution or just sharing of his story. Donations of $250 or more will get a special thank you from Duncan and I in the mail (details to follow).Duncan has amassed quite a fan club on my Instagram (@littlecat_bigisland). Generous donors from around the country have provided food, treats, and money for his previous vet bills. I'm only one person, but with social media I've been connected with caring people all over the world and together we have made a difference. We saved Harriet's life. And Blue's. And countless other fosters. We've fundraised for animal shelters and wildlife rehabilitation centers. We might not be able to make a difference for every animal in the world, but we CAN make a world of difference to some. Thank you for reading Duncan's story. If nothing else, I hope you have learned something and feel compelled to act for an animal in need that you encounter in the future. But if you do feel moved to donate, please know that the next time this little warrior says ""Hello World! It's me, Duncan. I'm still here!"" it will be because of YOU.Thank you.You can follow Duncan on Instagram (@littlecat_bigisland) for daily updates. And you are welcome to message me there with questions about him, his condition, and his possible treatment. He is still looking for a forever home in the Davis, California area, but if he gets this treatment we will wait 2 months to document his improvement and update his care routine. Aside from this one-time radiation series, Duncan's special needs care is inexpensive and easy, but we are looking for an adopter who has experience with special needs animals or someone who works in veterinary medicine.*Harriet the French Bulldog puppy was our last medical foster/Craigslist rescue. She was being given away, because she had a severe rectal prolapse and needed emergency treatment. Donors like you provided the lifesaving funds to treat her! Harriet ended up needing various surgeries and procedures, but she ultimately made a full recovery and was adopted through the NorCal Bully Breed Rescue in December.

You might have recently graduated college, celebrated an engagement, or spent your days dreaming about your future. Your life was just beginning and the sky was the limit. Now imagine if you received news that can turn your world upside down and in a moment’s notice, needing to shift your focus to fight the biggest battle of your life. Meet Breanna Palumbo! Daughter to Tim Swanson, a 22-year Marine EOD veteran, and Lynnette Swanson, a military spouse for 32 years, and sister to Amanda Swanson. At just 24-years-old, Breanna received the devastating news that she has been diagnosed with Breast Cancer. Breanna is about to begin a long and hard road to recovery and needs us now more than ever both financially and emotionally to fight this battle. Breanna celebrated the marriage to her new husband Anthony in 2020 and recently became a mom to a beautiful baby boy named Luca. Breanna and Anthony met in 2019 through Boulder Crest Foundation, a nonprofit provisioning transformative PTS programs for veterans and first responders where her mother works and her father-in-law had been a board member.This hurdle will only make them stronger as a family. As an independent, self-sufficient, woman who fights for what she wants, Breanna is ready to do whatever it takes to be there for her newborn son and husband and is extremely grateful for all the support she’s receiving. Breanna has an incredible team of dedicated doctors who have created extensive treatment plans to help her beat Breast Cancer. In order to have the opportunity to expand her family in the future, her team of doctors have recommended she undergo an egg harvest immediately before she starts her cancer treatment. Chemotherapy and radiation can cause damage to the ovaries. The cost of the egg harvesting process is approx. $18,000 which insurance does not cover.After the egg harvesting, the next step will be to start chemotherapy. Her team of doctors have suggested 6 rounds of chemotherapy, one round every 2-3 weeks. Following chemotherapy Breanna will undergo surgery and radiation.Breanna is undeniably a fighter, but knowing you have a strong community and can use the power of your voice makes it a little less daunting and lonely. Anyone who has been through this experience or has known someone who has will understand the uphill battle the Palumbo and Swanson family is about to face and how quickly medical costs can add up for cancer treatment. Stand with us all and help Breanna fight Breast Cancer. We invite you to donate to Breanna’s Cancer treatment fund which will cover her egg harvest and medical expenses.She deserves to enjoy all life has to offer in her next chapter of motherhood.

Many of you know our baby, Luis Adrian, was born on November 29th at almost 31 weeks. Although the whole process took us by surprise, we know that God has control of his life from the moment he was conceived. At birth, he weighed 2.15lbs. The wonderful blessing of hearing his first cry right when he was born filled us with hope. A hope that has lasted through the entire process. Adrian has been at NICU since birth. He has had 2 infections and a few complications- it has been a journey with ups and downs, but, overall we are thankful because of God’s faithfulness through it all - only He has sustained us. Today, he weighs 4 BIG pounds :) He is stable and developing. We are getting closer to the day we can bring him home. The weight was one of the requirements to be discharged. The other is that he learns to manage breathing as he eats - his oxygen saturation drops but we are seeing progress!Although we have not had much time to rest, Andrea is doing well with her recovery. We have been coming to the hospital everyday to be with our baby. We are also blessed to have the support of our family, who have done just about anything they can amid the pandemic. We also want to acknowledge all the prayers that have been lifted up for his life. Thank You. Not enough words to express our gratitude. God has given us peace and we trust that He is doing the best for the three of us. Many of you have reached out and have asked how can you help. Well, this is where we open our hearts to you.Unfortunately, our insurance has a limit for complications for a newborn, and about a week ago, we reached that limit (about $30,000). Now we have to pay for the 100% of the expenses. We still do not know what the total will be, but trust God’s provision. We have been in the NICU for almost a month and have seen God through it all! If it’s within your possibilities, with a humble heart, we would like to ask you to support us financially for the hospital bills and his medical appointments after he is discharged. Most importantly, we ask you to continue praying for us. We know that battles are fought on our knees. Please continue to pray for our little boy.Through this time, we have learned to rest in God and embrace His presence, our faith has been made stronger, our hearts have grown bigger, and our love for our baby becomes greater every day.We prayed this verse the day Adrian was born: “Mightier than the waves of the sea is His love for you” Psalms 93:4 -and this continues to be true.

Nos vamos acercando al día en que podamos traerlo a casa. El peso es uno de los requerimientos para que el bebé pueda salir del hospital. Otro, es que aprenda a comer y respirar al mismo tiempo. Aunque todavía esta teniendo un poco de problema al coordinar, estamos viendo el progreso.Aunque no hemos tenido mucho tiempo para descansar, Andrea se ha recuperado muy bien. Hemos venido al hospital todos los días para estar con nuestro bebé. Somos muy bendecidos por tener el apoyo de nuestras familias que han hecho todo lo que pueden en medio de esta pandemia. Aprovechamos para agradecer a todas las personas que han orado por la vida de Luis Adrian. No hay suficientes palabras para agradecerles. Dios nos ha dado paz y confiamos en que Él esta haciendo lo mejor para nosotros tres.Algunos de ustedes nos han contactado preguntado como pueden ayudar. Ahora es cuando abrimos nuestros corazones a ustedes.Desafortunadamente nuestro seguro tiene un límite para complicaciones para el recién nacido y hace casi una semana llegamos a ese límite.

On Thursday 11th Feb our amazing sister Roisin was diagnosed with a rare aggressive form

Of cancer osteosarcoma to her lower right jaw.

This devastating news came and a blow and has rocked her family and trying to come to terms with it.

Roisin has shown amazing courage and bravery over the last 3 weeks as she found out her long intense chemo plan of between 3-6 days of 3 types of constant chemo over the next few months and including removal of the tumour and reconstruction.

Roisin over the past years has thrown herself from a plane at 10,000 feet to raise money for Alzheimer’s Scotland after her uncle was diagnosed, then climbed Ben Nevis during the night to raise money for MS.Just lately she spent months collecting Care Kits for Shelter and spent many months after distributing to many of the homeless throughout Paisley and Glasgow. Even after diagnoses she had some she still had to donate before she got too ill.

It’s not always the big charity fundraisers Roisin does, it’s just being there as the best sister or friend to listen and care in her own special way.

Roisin started her first week of chemo on Wednesday the 3rd March and will continue for 23 weeks. We aren’t planning for the the future we are taking it hour by hour day by day and holding her hand each step of the way.

As her siblings we would love to give Roisin a little something to look forward to in December when she kicks the big Cs ass, and give to her what she has so kindly given to others over the years. She talks of travel but that could be anywhere from Gigha to Goa she loves nature and being as close as possible to it.So let’s give her a little something to look forward too.

This type of cancer is fast growing with less treatment options and with a high rate of recurrence in the first 5 years.A lump was detected in her right breast in late December and by the time of her imaging tests in January, the mass had grown to over 5 cm and spread to the axillary lymph nodes. Shortly after, a biopsy revealed that the tumor was Grade 3, indicating the most aggressive grade of cancer cells. Janice has recently started her long journey of treatment and recovery, which will involve 5 months of intensive chemotherapy, then surgery and radiation. Before the diagnosis, Janice had been balancing many different roles -- working while home educating her youngest son, assisting her parents who have chronic illnesses, on top of managing her own household all during a pandemic. At this point in time, Janice's ability to work is limited and it is challenging to balance these roles while also focusing on her own healing and recovery. As many people know, Janice is an extremely loving and generous person who helps anyone without reservation and never asks for anything in return. She is an amazing mother to her three children, a supportive wife to her husband, a caring daughter to her parents, and a wonderful sister to her siblings. It is our hope that we can return the love and generosity she has shown others by coming together and helping her in this time of need.

They put him on anti-epileptic medicine and his license was revoked until further notice. It took him almost a week to regain his full strength and get back into the flow of things. He was referred to a neurologist where they issued an EEG and a MRI, as well as a referral to a Cardiologist. The MRI showed what may represent an arachnoid cyst (extra fluid) or mega cisterna magna (enlarged space). At this point, the neurosurgeon did not believe brain surgery was vital.Into the new year, Christopher has had 5 more prominent seizures. He's increased dosages, switched medications and is currently taking multiple medications (though nothing seems to work). A month ago, after exhausting all options his neurologist referred him to a specialist. This neurologist specializes in seizures, epilepsy and EEGs. Christopher took another MRI and completed a comprehensive 48 hr EEG. With a more in-depth MRI and more experienced eyes, the neurologist pinpointed an abnormal growth on his right amygdala (2x the size of the left). This growth could be focal cortical dysplasia (congenital abnormality of the organization of brain layers and bizarre neurons) or a low grade tumor. The 48 hr EEG showed that Christopher had 3 seizures (abnormal electrical discharges). The neurologist calls these 'silent seizures;"" in which they do not disrupt Christopher's every day behavior. His silent seizures are unique and present the problem of not understanding what medicine is actually helping him.With all this new knowledge, both the neurologist and the neurosurgeon recommend moving Christopher forward with brain surgery. Not only will this surgery allow him to be seizure free, it will allow us to get ahead of the possible tumor that can present bigger issues down the road. Stereotactic Laser Ablation Surgery is a minimally invasive procedure that may reduce certain surgical risks, reduce pain and shorten recovery time. Christopher's surgery date is currently set for Friday, May 29th at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach.This past year has been challenging for Christopher and me, but along the way we knew that God was working and healing. God's strength is what helped us power forward and His hope is what gave us peace in the unknown. We are extremely grateful for this opportunity of brain surgery and we trust that this is the most effective next step in Christopher's health journey.We are reaching out, because we know that we are surrounded by so many amazing people that have such big hearts. Any monetary amount is received with love and appreciation. But what's bigger and more important than money, are your prayers.

We was given the devastating news that Emmy will not survive. How long this may be we do not know but as a family we want to help her on her final journey.

We understand the past year has been tough for everyone but any small donation will be great fully received to help them during this difficult time.

He was diagnosed with a brain tumor and had extensive brain surgery on March 11th at Duke Hospital in Durham, N.C.  The expert neurosurgical team at Duke was able to remove most of the tumor, but because of the granular nature of it, small bits remain in the brain. He will need constant follow up and possibly further oncological procedures. We will know in a few weeks what further treatments are needed. At the least, it will be necessary for Lucas to remain in ongoing medical care, requiring trips to Durham as well as caremanagement in Springfield for an undetermined amount of time. He will require 24- hour caregiving for at least a month and will be able to do little, if any, regular work. Lucas is 37, self-employed, and has minimal insurance through the healthcare exchange. He will have upcoming medical bills, travel expenses, and lost wages. He has full mobility, but because of his seizure he cannot drive for at least 6 months so will have to compensate drivers and caregivers. We anticipate that costs for healthcare, travel expenses, transportation help, 24-hour caregiving, and lost wages could exceed $30,000. All funds (minus 2.9% GoFundMe fees and credit card processing) will go directly to Lucas to help with normal bills, living expenses, and healthcare.Lucas is thankful for any amount you can donate as well as your wishes, thoughts, and prayers. If you would prefer to contribute directly through Venmo or PayPal, he can accept those methodsof payments as well.Read more"

Danny is a valued employee, co-worker, and friend as well as a loving husband and father. Danny has worked for United Airlines for 36 years. Laura, Danny's wife, is also a United Airlines employee who has worked in customer service for the last 42 years. On October 13, 2020, what started out an ordinary day suddenly turned tragic when Danny was involved in a serious automobile accident while traveling to spend time with his daughter Amy and his son-in-law Austin as well as the family dog at a local forest preserve. Danny sustained life threatening injuries as a result of this horrible accident. The most serious of which is a traumatic brain injury. After spending the first several weeks at Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Danny was transferred to Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago Illinois. Unfortunately, Danny has not regained consciousness since the accident.While at Shirley Ryan, Danny began a comprehensive TBI rehabilitation program to promote healing and to help accelerate recovery. Danny, at the time of this writing, has shown signs of progress. As long as progress is made, Danny will be allowed to stay and continue to recover. Eventually, Danny will be going home. This could happen quickly and is dependent on how he is responding to rehabilitation and the insurance companies willingness to pay for treatment. Due to the fact that Danny will be returning home, Laura has to make modifications to the house in order to be able to manage the current situation. There will be a bedroom/bathroom built on the first floor as well as a ramp installed to help get Danny in and out of the house as needed. Obviously, the cost involved in this alone will be large. This is where immediate financial assistance is needed. I, myself have worked at United Airlines for 33 years. United is more than just a company to work for. It is a family built through lifelong friendships and commitment.2020 has been an extremely challenging year to say the least. There are many family stories of tragedy and sorrow. This is one of many; however, with the love and support of our United family and friends, we can help Danny and his family get through this together. I also want to be very clear on the facts of how this fundraiser came to be. Since day one of the accident ALL United Airlines employees I have came in contact with have been asking how they could help. This includes ramp service, customer service, and management employees. This speaks volumes not only to who Danny is, but to the identity of all United Airlines employees at ORD.As I have mentioned, 2020 has been a rough year. Whatever you can do to support this cause will be needed and extremely appreciated. All funds received go directly to Laura Lynn as she is the sole beneficiary of this fundraiser. Also, I ask that you share this GoFundMe link with your social media network (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) to get this out to as many people as possible. Thank you for your help and support.Read more"

We have been made aware that Tina, who is Ceci’s mom, Kenia and Oscars Grandma/Guardian, and the smiling lady behind taco Tuesday, needs to have surgery to fix a serious medical issue that has come up very suddenly. The problem is not life threatening at this time, but does have to be dealt with quickly by surgery.

Tina and her family have been giving of themselves during this Covid pandemic by volunteering many hours to help feed the less fortunate in the La Peñita area. She has also given to her local community by supplying food at her home to anyone who needs it in this tough time in México, and the world. She is a good friend of La Peñita RV Park, and now it is our turn to give back. The surgery and recovery care she needs will cost approximately $3000 CAD (50,000 pesos) and there will be other expenses associated with it. If you can, we are asking you to help out this family in their time of need. Thank you. Susan & Lorne Green.

As a key partner to the Humane Societies and SPCA’s as well as Municipal, Provincial, and Federal Authorities across Canada, Little Ray’s has self funded the rescue, care and relocation of over 6,000 animals. Some animals have remained at Little Ray’s, in sanctuary, as appropriate permanent placements have not been available. Since March of 2020 Little Ray’s has accepted roughly 100 extra animals from organizations which had to fully close their doors due to the impacts of Covid-19. Currently, over 80% of the animals residing at Little Ray’s are rescues. Our goal has always been to provide exceptional care while finding the most ideal, permanent solutions for these animals to comfortably live out their lives.Ten months into the Covid-19 pandemic, Little Ray’s remains shut down, in further lockdown, relying on government programs, business loans and support from the general public to keep the lights on, pay staff, pay veterinary bills, feed the animals, and continue its crucial conservation and rescue efforts.Small business is being decimated. In that sense we are not unique. What sets us apart from other businesses is our responsibility to provide for over 900 animals in our care. We can’t ‘shut down’. We’ve had to close our doors but our overhead remains the same. Turning off the lights and walking away to ride out the storm is not an option for the staff working at Little Ray’s.Since March of 2020 we are now down $750,000 in cash flow. This is after taking into account the support from the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and the Canadian Emergency Rent Subsidy (CERS).The Federal and Provincial governments recognize that certain sectors of small business have been crushed. They say they want to help. Yet we are expected to borrow our way out of this financial crisis, only to be required to pay back what could be close to $2,000,000 plus interest. With our nature/rescue centres facing such an uncertain future we are forced to make some very tough decisions.Effective immediately we are not able to responsibly assist with any further rescues. Our focus must remain on providing for the over 900 animals currently in our care.Furthermore, without immediate significant funding and proper support to our organization we will have no choice but to start the process of winding down our nature/rescue centre operations over the next 6 months. We simply can not borrow near $2,000,000 to get to a point where we can start the process to return to normal and have any chance of recovery.Little Ray’s Nature Centres is a company that has played a critical role across Canada to multiple animal welfare organizations and government authorities at all levels. We have driven jobs and paid our fair share of taxes to our economy. We have been completely shut down and are now expected to borrow our way through this time while many of Canada’s largest most profitable companies receive government hand-outs so they can pay dividends to shareholders.We are fighting for the opportunity to reasonably continue while supporting much needed animal welfare, rescue, and education across Canada. We are not looking to pay dividends or get rich. We just want to survive!We have a distance to go to get through this unprecedented time and are facing tremendous uncertainty. Any support, whether it be a purchase through our webstore, our Adopt an Animal Program, booking a zoo zoom or certificate for future use, or through donation or sponsorship is a valued gift to us here at Little Ray’s!We continue to remain positive and look toward brighter days.

We hope you will find it in your heart to send some positive thoughts and prayers his way today and in the days to come.As some of you know, Fred was involved in a devastating car accident last week, March 10, 2021. This accident left him with multiple broken bones and spinal damage. He is currently hospitalized at UNC Hospital and has already undergone a lengthy surgery to repair some of the injuries he has faced. He has a long and challenging road to recovery ahead of him.Due to COVID-19 limitations, his wife is having to face most of the hospital visits alone without little to no room for relief. At this point, it is unknown exactly what challenges they will face during his recovery process, but we do know there will be many unexpected expenses as a result of this accident. Due to his injuries, we expect he may be hospitalized for an extended period which means his wife will commute back and forth to the hospital while also managing their home and their son’s needs. As he begins to recover, there may also be a need to purchase equipment to help with his rehabilitation and recovery.Many have asked how you can help. In addition to your prayers for his complete healing, we want to make sure we can help alleviate the financial burden that this situation has brought upon this family so suddenly.Let’s show Fred and the Taylor family that they are not alone and how much he is loved by his family, friends, and small-town community!

We worked diligently to resurrect it as a safe space for the community and to keep the Stonewall Inn at the epicenter of the fight for the LGBTQ+ rights movement. It has been a community tavern, but also a vehicle to continue the fight that started there in 1969. Stonewall is the place the community gathers for celebrations, comes to grieve in times of tragedy, and rally to continue the fight for full global equality.Today, we are asking you to help Save Stonewall! The Stonewall Inn faces an uncertain future and we are in need of community support. The road to recovery from the COVID 19 pandemic will be long and we need to continue to safeguard this vital piece of living history for the LGBTQ community and the global human rights movement and we now must ask for your help to save one of the LGBTQ+ communities most iconic institutions and to keep that history alive.

Hey guys, my name is Jeff Dodgen and I am a friend of John Hamon and family. As you likely know his sweet puppy is having some medical issues right her before Christmas, and the only thing his daughters want is for Abby to be able to come home alive and healthy. John is not one to ask for help...I am the same way, so that is why I am doing the asking. Right now what they need is money to help with the vet expenses. The vet is keeping Abby alive in hopes that the medication will help her get through he issues long enough for it to pass, but its costly. Kids don't understand the financial issues with helping a family pet, they just want their puppy home with them and honestly money is what will help the most right now.

I admit I have never done one of the accounts and sometimes doubt where the money goes...I assure you everything collected here that I receive will go straight to the family for them to decide where to use it. Hopefully it can be used to help Abby in her recovery, but if we collect more than needed I will ask John to make a donation in ""Abby's"" name from his daughters to the Humane Society.

Thank you for your support in helping me heal my brain, body, and mind so I can begin to start my service and my mission to the world."" Love, MonaMona is meeting with specialists from an amazing team of doctors and holistic healing practitioners to find out the cause of Mona’s rapidly deteriorating neurological condition and brain inflammation over the last 4 months. This is layered on top of her longterm (13-year) battle with late-stage Lyme disease / myalgic encephalitis (ME) that have caused a myriad of other health issues. At this time, Mona is experiencing a level of suffering and a need for care that is unprecedented.Her neurological encephalopathy and brain inflammation has gotten to a point where her brain feels like is on fire, and not responding to any medication or other relief body is reacting with seizure-like activity, uncontrollable tremors and shaking/violent convulsions in arms and legs, excruciating pain, pressure and brain inflammation that have led to several hospitalizations, dementia-like symptoms (she has found periods where she does not know where she is), uncontrolled vomiting, visual impairments, electrocutions in her nerves, fatigue, loss of feeling in limbs, confusion, hallucinations, panic attacks that last for weeks, and dozens of other symptoms which are rapidly accelerating including loss of her motor skills. Just getting down the stairs is like climbing Mt. Everest, and she needs support of a friend or caregiver to walk 2 blocks. While she has endured health challenges before, nothing has come close to the level of disability she is in now.Her medical team is still trying to determine the causes of her condition, and investigate as they may be multiple, and layered on top of her complex health history creates a more challenging picture. Her medical team is ruling out MS, ALS, anti NDMA-receptor encephalitis, and other rare degenerative neurological autoimmune diseases (see below for more detail). The physical and emotional toll this is taking is unbearable. She is unable to do much on her own, except dress herself and shower, she has not been able to work, and has moved back to her parents’ home in Michigan where her almost-80 year old parents care for her. They are unable to care for her completely at their age so she needs funds to get caretaking support (which is not covered by medical insurance despite her doctor's filing for this).As such, we are asking for your heartfelt emotional support—your love and blessings—but also your generous financial assistance, as she’s in need of round-the-clock medical care which she and her family can’t possibly bear on their own. Let’s all join together now and do everything possible to help her in every way each of us can as her condition is deteriorating and she needs us more than ever.Listed here are the various treatments and care options available to her, and as you can see, it’s a tremendous financial burden, though entirely necessary at this time for her recovery.MONTHLY EXPENSES (for the last 4 months and projected next 8 months based on doctors’ estimates:$2300: caregiver$2500 (Team of Neurologists, Autoimmune Specialists, Endocrinologists, Functional/Integrative MDs, Naturopath/Homeopath), which Insurance Does Not Cover$1200: IV treatments$800: Medications, Supplements, Holistic Treatment protocols, CoPays for Specialized Scans$450: Acupuncture and Chinese medicine$700 EMDR and Trauma Therapy$600 Autonomic nervous system retraining + biofeedback$400 monthly health insurance payment$300 Monthly Craniosacral treatment$600 Neuroplasticity Course and Brain Training$700: Therapeutic Coaching and Support$2000: General Living Expenses$12,550 MonthlyPlusOne Time Costs$8000 Spect brain scans, and follow up evaluation by the Amen Brain Clinic’s top neuroscientists, neurologists, and psychiatrists over next 7 months$20,000 Roughly for future treatments on brain as recommended by Amen Brain Clinic + neurologist (hyperbaric oxygen chamber, transmagnetic brain stimulation, PEMF, possibly IV Ketamine) + Follow Up SPECT Brain Scans$5000 Costs associated with moving/finding long term place to have 24-7 care or home with caregiver as Mona’s Parents are unable to do so long-term----Mona is a beautiful soul who has given as a humanitarian, civil rights lawyer, non-profit co-founder, and beacon of support for so many who have suffered. She spent her life working with the disabled (or specially abled as she sees it), the homeless, women who were brought into sexual trafficking rings in post-war Sarajevo, refugees, women and children victims of domestic violence, and many more. Her desire to help others has been evident from a young age, when Mona flew to India for the first time (she is of Indian ancestry) at the age of 4, she demanded her parents break her piggy bank and she took bags of pennies to India and handed them out to each person she saw on the street (despite her mother's please that this would be useless since American pennies had no value in India). Mona's desire to give back to humanity and help others, to help awaken consciousness on this planet by being in SERVICE has been known by all around her. She is operating with very little left but she keeps going because she knows that her experience with trauma + illness is meant to serve a greater purpose to help those who area also suffering all around the world. She has inspired others as a humanitarian, lawyer, speaker, entrepreneur, and most recently at her one woman performance - Monamorphosis - which inspired people to welcome and meet their darkest emotions and experiences as an opportunity for complete transformation. This performance was more than Monaacting out her life story on stage - it was a transmission of her heroine's journey to illuminate the beauty of feeling to healing and to remind others they can also overcome anything. Please assist Mona on the path back to wholeness so she can live her purpose of service that she has been wanting to do her whole life.Infinite gratitude to all those who have taken the time to read this and have opened their hearts, lending all possible assistance to Mona at this very difficult time. For those who know her well, you know what a blessing it is to bask in her sublime radiance and how difficult this must be for her, which is why we want to help her in any way possible to get through this.More Detailed Info On Mona's Story: https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/monamotwani/journal/view/id/5fd016324d8b7100016e705eRead more"

During the procedure, the surgeon unexpectedly discovered tumors along his abdominal lining, which led to a diagnosis of Stage IV Colon Cancer. The doctors have moved swiftly and Kyler will be undergoing an aggressive treatment plan that includes surgery and chemotherapy to rid his body of the cancer.Prior to this diagnosis, Kyler was working very hard every day as a delivery driver. During his recovery process, he will not be able to earn money while he is undergoing and recovering from surgery and chemotherapy. This fund is to help support Kyler in paying his regular living expenses including food and rent, and to help him pay medical costs.All of Kyler's subsequent medical appointments have indicated that the cancer is contained to a localized area, and that Kyler stands a good chance of beating this by taking swift and decisive action to remove the tumors and undergo chemotherapy. Because of this, Kyler has been able to maintain an overall positive approach to the situation. He has committed to a number of lifestyle changes in order to maximize his chances of beating cancer.A small team of Kyler's friends have been meeting regularly to develop a plan on how to support him throughout his recovery. If you would like to offer your support, there are two ways to do this; the first is to make a donation to this gofundme. We don't know exactly how long Kyler will be out of commission and so we are aiming high on our fundraising goal; The second way is to visit the Planner on Kyler's CaringBridge page or Kyler's MealTrain page and sign up for one or more of the slots that are open. These slots are for concrete things that we know Kyler will need such as meals, rides to doctor appointments, etc. We will be updating these pages regularly to reflect what is needed.https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/kylerfischerhttps://www.mealtrain.com/trains/l1n6drPlease give what you can to support this amazing guy who gives so much to his friends, family, and community.

We learned that she had a condition called ruptured diverticulitis—she had developed a pouch along her large intestine that, when inflamed, ruptured into a small hole in her intestinal wall. After three days, she was discharged as the hole closed up on its own. She was hospitalized for the same condition again in October 2018, and we scheduled a surgery that would remove the affected areas of her colon after she had recovered.Becca went into surgery on November 20 to remove 20% of her colon, and was expected to make a full recovery by just after Thanksgiving. However, complications ensued—it was later learned through tissue analysis on her removed colon that her infection that led to the diverticulitis hadn’t gone away before she went into surgery, and was now interfering with her recovery. After several days without any food and enduring an NG tube, Becca had to get an ileostomy, diverting her small intestine into an external pouch on her side while her large intestine healed over the next few months. Becca was discharged after 16 days in the hospital, and faced an additional three weeks of recovery at-home.During this time, our families and jobs were an immense help—Becca was allowed to take an extended leave of absence while I was able to use PTO from my job to help take care of her. We had savings for a future house, but knew her health was a more immediate and important concern—and helped us get through her recovery.However, things took a turn for the worse in January. Becca lost her job after nearly 3 years, and for several weeks we had to rely on our savings to get through her recovery to now help us through her search for a job.In her post-hospitalization follow up visits, Becca also learned that she’s developed a hernia around her stoma (intestinal output) due to additional strain, making her ability to lift weight or exercise diminish lest she incur further complications. Becca’s gained a temp position, but the requirements for her work demanded we push her ileostomy reversal surgery to May instead of the originally-planned March. She also took a major pay cut, but with the potential to maybe make more than her last job in a year’s time.All the while, we’ve had the bills from Becca’s surgery and extended hospital stays looming over us (roughly $7200), to say nothing of the reversal surgery, hospital stay, and recovery to come—all while Becca is out of work during that time period. Our savings has been halved already, and everything else would clear that out and still leave us in the red. Upon receiving our bills we applied for Seton’s financial assistance program, but were denied. We’ve reapplied in the wake of Becca’s job loss. We’ve indefinitely put off searching for a house, and we’re working with Seton to figure out a payment plan for what we currently owe. But with a sudden hospital visit tonight (March 25th), we feel like we’re in way over our heads with little relief in sight.Funds would go towards paying the medical bills we currently owe ($7200), as well as providing a buffer for the next surgery to come (Hospital bills, paying Becca’s normal monthly bills/rent share while recovering and out of work, etc.)We know these are tough times for everyone, but Becca and I would greatly appreciate whatever you may be able to donate to help us out. We wouldn’t have gotten this far without the love and support of our family and friends, and we’re grateful for your continued presence in our lives.Read more"

Please keep donating if able - everything goes to the family.On Tuesday, February 16 I received word of the the tragic passing of my dear friend Marquette Yarbrough, known lovingly by his nickname Mick by family and the fighting game community. We soon discovered he had been robbed and killed in his home in Memphis sometime during the weekend, senselessly taking from us a beloved man and leaving his family and loved ones in sudden mourning.Mick was a veteran of the army and a truly iconic figure and fixture in the fighting game community, particularly in the Tekken and SoulCalibur communities. He is the winner of numerous tournaments for both games and represented team USA at the world tournament for SoulCalibur II in Cannes, France in 2004. Known for his contagious self-confidence and flare for showmanship, he was always willing to help others learn to play and loved to talk game theory. Through his travels of over 20 years he gained many friends and fans from around the world. He was truly a legend and will always be remembered.Where and how the money is going: I am raising funds to pay for Mick's funeral and memorial service - to take place on February 27th. All donations will go to his mother, Verna Yarbrough, to cover the expense. The expenses are: the wake, the memorial service, and the burial. Anything over those costs will be a gift to the Yarbrough family to assist in the mourning and recovery process. I will withdraw the donations to my account and present Mick's mother with a check in that amount when I see her at the services. She has given me permission to to do so.My relation to Mick: I first became friends with Mick in 2002, we traveled the country together to many tournaments. Mick was a regular attendant of my annual tournament, Kumite in Tennessee, where we would reconnect every year.Everything is truly appreciated.Sincerely,Ian Davis, fund organizerRead more"

What we did know is that Luis would not be home for several months, and upon release from the hospital , he would most likely undergo a lengthy recovery.Within the first 15 days Luis suffered several additional brain strokes which caused a rare condition called ""Locked-In Syndrome."" At this point he was unable to move anything other than his eyes but at times was aware of his surroundings. After a couple more massive brain strokes, the doctor's determined there was no more function in his brain.Luis was moved from Shands to the the hospital in Leesburg and from there, on March 22, he was transferred to Hospice. On March 24, 2021, Luis passed away from complications of the several massive strokes.His wife, Liza, is trying her best to maintain Boondocks K9 SAR, the Boondocks training facility for dogs (which are non-profit organizations). She also maintains the Vega Weims breeding facility as well as taking care of her home, her family and herself. Unfortunately, it has become impossible her to maintain the search and rescue unit and the breeding facility due to lack of monitary resources.Luis was the sole provider for his family. With the strokes and then his passing, no current funds are coming in.Liza is asking for help to pay for rent & utilities for her home, as well as money to feed the remaining dogs that are located at the training facility. Most importantly to pay for the astronomical medical bills that continue come in. At present, the running total for medical bills are above $1,000,000.00.Luis has always been a strong supporter in the community as well as helping in natural disasters in other places including the hurricane support in Puerto Rico & The Bahamas.

Five days after placing 5th at the 2007 World Championships Joe went into sudden cardiac arrest and his wrestling career unexpectedly ended due to a rare congenital heart condition.However, Joe’s story of survival in 2007 is just a part of his awe-inspiring journey.Prior to his retirement from competitive wrestling in 2007, Heskett was training as a 2008 U.S. Olympic Team hopeful. In June 2007, he earned a spot on the U.S. World Team roster and won a silver medal at 163 pounds at the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. At the World Wrestling championships in 2007, Heskett was one of five wrestlers to qualify his weight class for the 2008 Olympics after winning a silver medal.At Iowa State, Heskett became the Cyclones' eighth four-time All-American (1[phone redacted]) with a career record of 143-9. Third on ISU's all-time wins list, Heskett finished third in 1999 at the NCAA championships and second in 2000 and 2001, before capturing the 165-pound title in 2002. Heskett was a three-time Big 12 champion (1999, 2001, 2002) and three-time Midlands champion (1998, 2000, 2001).Heskett earned his bachelor's degree in speech communications from Iowa State in 2002 before graduating from Cal Poly with a master's degree, with honors, in educational leadership in 2005. In 2018, Heskett finished his doctorate studies at West Virginia University with a specific interest in human potential development as well as individual, team, and organizational leadership.On Thursday, March 12, 2020 Joe had a massive stroke. He is currently in Riverside Methodist Hospital in Columbus Ohio which specializes in neurological medical conditions. Fortunately, he is resting and in stable condition at this time and the staff is working on helping him to understand what has happened. The next phase is to transfer him to a rehabilitation facility for extensive therapy. Unfortunately, the insurance that he has will not cover the rehabilitation facility for his therapy and any financial assistance will be much appreciated. Joe is a world-class fighter, and it will be amazing to be a part of his recovery and watch how this tragedy can, like the massive heart attack, be used as fuel for his life mission.

He was sleeping and woke up to the panic of his mom yelling that a very large pot of oil had caught on fire. Dobra bravely stormed towards the fire in an attempt to put it out. According to him, he says that the fire extinguisher was behind the fire and very hard to reach. As he attempted to find a route to the extinguisher, the large pot of oil exploded and immediately burned him. Subsequently, the sprinkler system went off and Dobra proceeded to roll on the floor in pain as the water from the sprinkler system began to agitate his burns. In a fight or flight response, Dobra found the strength to rise up and drag his mom out of his home. His mother, being in shock, wanted to fight the fire until the end.Fortunately, Dobra was able to get her out of the burning building. He immediately pointed at a stranger and yelled for them to call 911 to reach the fire department. Dobra then proceeded to evacuate as many residents as he could by sprinting to each neighbor’s home barefoot to bang on their doors and alert them to escape. Once he finished making a large scene and evacuating people, he noticed that his mother had grabbed a new fire extinguisher and went back into the home. According to Dobra, his heart flew out of his chest in fear. He immediately charged back into his home to save his mom, but unfortunately, the smoke started to burn his lungs and he was forced to step out of the house and recalculate. He was astonished at the fact that he had lived in his home for many years but couldn’t tell up from down and left from the right due to the fact that his entire home was a pit of darkness, due to the smoke, from the ceiling to the carpet.On top of that, his senses were disoriented due to the original oil explosion. Dobra then decided that he’d rather go down trying to save his mom instead of waiting outside feeling powerless while hoping for her safe return. As Dobra opened his front door to attempt to enter his burning home for the 3rd time, his mother followed the light from the exit and came out safe and sound, accepting the harsh reality that their home of many years is now gone.Fortunately, due to Dobra’s heroics, nobody else was injured on that day. Unfortunately, Dobra and his mom lost almost all of their belongings in their home. Dobra suffered from burns to his entire face, both of his arms, parts of both of his legs. Along with a fall scrape that was so severe, he lost all of the skin on his left knee cap, a sprained right ankle, a bruise on his head, and broken glass and splinters inside both of his bare feet. Dobra has received treatment and is happy to be alive and that nobody else got severely injured or died.Anyone who has ever met Dobra can attest to his good character and how he is always willing to lend a helping hand no matter who you are. Being raised as an only child in a single-parent household, Dobra had to mature at a young age. He set his goals high and knew that hard work through education was his best bet at a better life. He is currently finishing up his sophomore year of college while majoring in actuarial science as a first-generation college student in America. The recovery ahead for Dobra will be long and difficult, but he has faith that the Lord will provide him with the strength to persevere through this difficult time. Any donations for Dobra would be extremely appreciated by him and his family as they try to heal from this tragic and traumatizing experience.Read more"

If you know our man Tito Teets, aka Daniel Martino, then you know the man is a jokester, a mensch, an artist, a father, a friend, and an avid Cleveland Browns fan. But most importantly, he’s a fighter. Tito is in the middle of his battle against a very rare form of spinal cancer called Sporadic Burkitt Lymphoma. Since spring 2020, he's undergone several surgeries and chemo treatments through summer, including a second round of chemo over Christmas. Now, Tito finds himself undergoing an unexpected third of chemotherapy plus a bone marrow transplant now at the James. While most of us were struggling to grasp onto some semblance of normalcy in 2020, Tito was not only dealing with the circumstances generated by the pandemic, but was also in and out of the hospital for most of the year, traveling from Athens to Columbus and back again.
Since that time, his intense treatments and rigorous chemo schedulehave left him unable to work. His brother and family have worked hard to provide a safe healing environment for him--it’s our turn to raise some cash and help them out. So, sports fans, that means we're looking to get our man's living expenses covered into AT LEAST the preseason. We're setting our goal at $10,000.Funds raised will go towards helping Tito and his family offset the cost of some bills, gas for his appointments, living expenses, and any other monetary support they may need throughout the coming months during treatment and recovery.

Though there is much uncertainty, Tito is in high spirits and fighting this as only he could, and we are here behind him every step of the way to best ensure that he wins. This Gofundme campaign stands alone as the source to donate directly to Tito in the name of Math and Science, but there will be at least one other fundraiser happening in Athens, including a plethora of r a f f l e gift baskets from many wonderful donors, so keep an eye on social media. (You should also stay tuned for episodes of TITO TV, which feature humorous bits of friends and family mixed about music videos of some of our favorite people.)

He hit his head and suffered a concussion with serious retrograde amnesia. In the CT scan at the Emergency room they found a mass of on his brain and recommended an MRI. The MRI revealed a 9mm x 8mm x 8mm malignant tumor.  The two weeks since the devastating diagnosis have been challenging for our family but we are blessed by the amount of support he has from work and family. The most extreme emotions come from all the uncertainty: will he need chemo and radiation therapy? Currently Tristan is scheduled for a diagnostic cerebral angiogram on Monday and tumor excision surgery Wednesday or Friday. We are hoping/praying for a best case scenario in that the surgeon cuts out all the cancerous tumor and that he will be cured.  We are also planning in case the road to recovery is longer with radiation and chemotherapy.I, his wife plan on staying in Seattle all next week while he has treatments and brain surgery. Our 5 year old son will be with my mom, his Baba and be visiting as much as he can. We are fortunate to have so much supportive family. We are praying for the ideal outcome of his surgery.We are raising funds to help pay for surgery and ensure that Tristan has enough time at home to recover from such a complex surgery. This would also fund lodging in Seattle near Swedish and associated travel costs in regards to his medical treatmentfollowing the surgery. We are eternally thankful for the outpouring love and support we are receiving. Our family cannot thankyou enough for keeping us in your thoughts and praying for Tristan.Read more"

If you have met him personally, you would attest that he is a very kind-hearted person who is always willing to help others. He resides with his parents and brothers and has yet to experience important milestones in his life like getting married and having children. He randomly developed seizures and decided to go to the Georgetown Public Hospital to get himself checked up. Initially, he was diagnosed with this condition at the age of 25 by Neurosurgeon Dr. Dukhi at the Georgetown Public Hospital. A brain mass is the growth of abnormal cells in your brain. Many different types of brain tumors exist. Some brain tumors are noncancerous (benign), and some brain tumors are cancerous (malignant). He completed multiple MRIs and Brain Scans which concluded that the mass was not growing and deemed benign 7 years ago.Throughout this period, he was heavily medicated to control the symptoms associated with epilepsy which was brought on by the mass. He was laid off from his employment with the Guysuco Blairmont Estate due to his illness and started farming at home to upkeep an income. During the last 7 years, his symptoms have worsened and even more so during this past month. A recent MRI confirmed that the mass is now a Tumor and has grown! Dr. Dukhi has placed him on a list for brain surgery, this surgery will be free of cost at the Georgetown Public Hospital. His family is kindly seeking assistance from the public community to offset his expenses like travel, recovery and testings. He has agreed to undergo the surgery being aware of the risks associated with it. Efforts are being made to see if his case can be accelerated since his condition is deteriorating rapidly. He has started developing new symptoms that include temporary loss of vision, numbness in his tongue, slurred speech, and loss of his balance/senses. This surgery will give Sharaz the fighting chance he deserves, we will need your help in order for this to happen. His family and friends are pleading to kind-hearted individuals to keep him in their prayers. Contributions in any amount are welcomed (small or big). If you are unable to contribute financially, please share this post to boost the visibility – someone you know may be able to.

Donations have now closed, but we are keeping the page up. If you'd like to share, please do! We are so inspired by our son and would love for his story to be available to anyone who would like to read it. - Aaron & Anna. This GoFundMe has been created to share Atticus’s story and help offset some of the medical costs from his recent diagnosis with Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH)- a rare form of childhood cancer. Any monetary contribution and/or share of this page is greatly appreciated during this trying time for our family. Below you can find the journey through cancer that Atticus has had to endure. Atticus’s Story:Atticus was born November 17th, 2015, and like many babies, he was born joyful and healthy. Atticus was welcomed into this world surrounded by our wonderful family, and there has been no shortage of love and support since that first day. For the first two years of life, Atticus showed no signs of any health-related troubles; there was no obstacle Atticus was too afraid to conquer. He bounced and ran; danced and sang; and loved and laughed through life. It wasn’t until May 24th of 2018 during his two-and-a-half-year checkup with his primary physician did they notice an abnormality in the shape of a small lump on the top of his head. After being sent for a CT scan, the doctors were able to determine the lump to be a tumor, and we were sent to Children’s where they confirmed the diagnosis of the cancer Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis. The following days at Children’s were filled with various tests and bloodwork, and after careful consideration from the incredible team of doctors, they determined neurosurgery was enough to remove the tumor completely, with no chemo deemed necessary. Atticus was to be suited up for an intensive cranial surgery to remove the LCH tumor on May 30th, 2018. The day came and went with deep worries, but proved to be a successful procedure; though, the recovery was trying for his two-year-old body and mind. Every six months following the procedure, Atticus would see a team of medical professionals and oncologists to complete bone scans to monitor for re-growth. At this time, Atticus was also balancing the daily struggles of chronic asthma and allergies. He quickly became no stranger to the caring team of doctors and nurses that helped him over the span of his life. Time began to pass, the years quickly flew, and now 5-year-old Atticus remained brave and charismatic as ever as his then partial-remission was coming to a close.Then, on November 30th, 2020, Atticus went into the doctor for what was meant to be his final Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis scan. It was then that the doctors noticed a new lesion on his pelvis. Although there was an initial unconcerned reaction from the doctors, thankfully, a few days later the decision to have Atticus complete a CT scan was made. On December 3rd, 2020, the scan confirmed the lesion was in fact a tumor on his pelvis. Atticus was then scheduled for a biopsy on December 18th, 2020 to determine the type of cancer and possibly remove portions of the tumor. Not only were the doctors able to retrieve enough of the tumor for the biopsy, but the surgeon was also able to successfully remove the mass completely. It was at this time that Atticus was again diagnosed with Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis; though this time, it was determined to be a systematic problem, that needed a more aggressive treatment. During the weeks that followed Atticus’s biopsy, we learned that he also has something called a BRAF mutation. Essentially, the cancer wasn’t as simple as they assumed it to be the first time, and without chemo, the LCH will continue to come back. With fear of what could further worsen in the future, he has been prescribed a specific and targeted form of oral chemotherapy. Atticus will be on this treatment for the next two years (if not several more), in addition to monthly blood work, echo scans completed every two-three months, bone scans every six months, and finally, yearly PET scans. At this time, Atticus has been taking his chemotherapy for 27 days and, to no one’s surprise, is doing great! We’ve seen few side effects and are very hopeful. This treatment is relatively new and somewhat experimental in Atticus’s case.Atticus has, no matter the medical obstacle, remained curious and happy throughout the five years of his life. He makes jokes with the nurses, asks the doctors plenty of questions, and insists on providing the same level of medical care to each and every one of his toys. But to no surprise, this journey has proven to be immeasurably challenging for us as a family. Not only is LCH and the chemo treatment physically taxing on his young body, but Atticus has also been faced with emotional difficulties navigating this experience, and will begin seeing a Children's Therapist to aid in his journey. This, along with the unsurprisingly costly medical treatments, diet changes, treatment-safe lotions, detergents, vitamins, and so on all to supplement his health, is why we ask for the support we need through the form of GoFundMe. Any contribution is greatly appreciated and will directly go to the expenses aforementioned. We ask that everyone share Atticus’s story, not just as a way to assist us, but to inspire others with our son’s strength in this difficult time. If Atticus has taught us anything, it is that life, although riddled with surprises, is best spent dancing with the people you love. We thank you all from the bottom of our hearts. With love, Aaron, Anna, and Atticus Hofbauer

If you are feeling called to action after that, please take that positive generosity and consider donating to the many other causes that require our help at this time. It's so inspiring to see how giving a community can be.---On Saturday night, my dear feline companion Lulu came home with a pained limp. I took her to the vet, who discovered her femur was broken in four places. Lulu had been hit by a car. Her elevated heart rate indicated she was already in agony and would need surgeryrightaway.The vet assured me that Lulu would see a full recovery, but post op treatments, medication and future examinations will put thetotal cost around $3500. I broke the bad news to my landlord, a senior I share Lulu with. It became apparent that neither of us could afford this emergency expense -- and he regretfully suggested that putting Lulu down was our only option. I couldn't bear the thought; it's just a broken limb and Lulu is more than just a cat. She’s my pal out in the garden, my mouser, and my bodyguard when I leave the house for walks. When I need comfort, she’s right by my side. I couldn't possibly leave hers at this time.Lulu underwent surgery Tuesday night and I'm happy to report that it was a success. I don't have any regrets saving her, but the costs are now mine alone to bear and I humbly ask for your help. I am a recent graduate working part time in healthcare and my wages can't cover this unexpected cost. I realize we are all going through a very difficult time emotionally, financially, and spiritually. I would never expect anyone to give from what they have worked so hard to earn, but all I can do is ask and hope for the best. Please, if you are able to help, every bit counts and is very much appreciated. Thank you for your support as I try to be there for my Lu in her time of need.Read more"

For Diana Brang, It got really bad real fast.- Spring/Summer 2020 Diana had been noticing muscle weakness in her arms and upper legs, it got to a point that she would need to use a desk or door handle to get up off the floor at work. She is a veterinary technician and needs to be down on the ground to take care of clients pets. By September, she was using a cane to move around and going up steps was a battle. - Fall 2020 Diana had to get muscle biopsies done on her arm and leg in order to find out why she was having rapid muscle loss. The biopsy from her left leg was taken putting additional weight on her right leg, where eventually Diana's right foot broke from the added stress. While waiting on multiple tests results and scans, Halloween night brought on another problem. What we thought was just stomach pain, turned into sweating, aches, confusion and not being able to hold herself up. 911 was called and was taken to St. Mary's of Livonia.  After a CT scan, emergency surgery was needed for a Perforation of her bowels.  After a 4 hour long surgery they found massive infection in her abdomen and spent the next week in the ICU. - December 2020 Just when we thought things were starting to mend, we received a call on the 3rd from her endocrinologist saying that Diana needs to get her cortisol levels checked as they were on the very high end. Soon after we found out that Diana was diagnosed with Cushing Disease  http://pituitary.ucla.edu/cushings-disease#:~:text=Cushing's%20disease%20is%20a%20serious,by%20the%20normal%20pituitary%20gland.That she has a tumor on her pituitary gland, After yet another MRI, it was found to be 8mm in size, the gland it self is around half that size.  While bad news, we at least had the reason for the rapid muscle atrophy, confusion, memory loss, struggles with speech, loss of bladder control and vision problems. So having a diagnosis was something good in way, even though Brain Tumor is not something people want to be told. - December 28th 2020 Diana Go's to Henry Ford Hospital for surgery. Surgery went well. I wish I could end it there but 2020 had one more wrench to throw into Diana's Life.  While being taken into recovery, Diana went into respiratory failure and had to be put on a ventilator. Fluid was discovered in her left lung and Pneumonia was the culprit. Nearing 3 weeks in an induced coma and multiple types of Antibiotics they constantly being sent through the IV line and even going into the lungs to clean out the infection, things were starting to get under control. After 3 weeks on a ventilator in the ICU and a couple of serious scares, Diana was taken off the ventilator and moved into the general hospital.  - January 26th 2021 Diana was in good enough condition to be discharged and sent directly into a Physical Therapy Center at Garden City Hospital, where she would stay for the next 2 weeks. What was supposed to be 3 days in the Hospital after the Tumor removal Turned into over a month and the end was still not in sight. While still not being able to have visitors, Family could at least stand out side her Therapy window and talk to her, It was the first time in over a month that we were able to see and speak to her. That brings on another issue, due to the ventilator, Diana's Left vocal cord was left paralyzed. Her voice may or may not ever come back to a normal level. Currently her voice is that of a whisper if the whisper was trying to be yelled out.  -March 2021 Diana is currently in out patient rehab to gain back her strength. Diana is now walking without the use of a walker or cane. Stairs still are a struggle. Using the bathroom, Showering and getting dressed are getting easier every day. She is not giving up and is thankful for a second chance at living her best life possible.   That Brings us to what the Go Fund Me is for. 2020 was rough for everyone, it still isn't that great, thankfully an end is possibly in sight for the Country. Diana Has been out of work since Late October 2020. Medical bills, Hospital Stays and Mortgage payments have drained everything we had set aside. Recovery, Follow up appointments, CT Scans and More MRI's, and Physical Therapy is still going on and still adding up. Diana is set to go back to work this April, But at Part Time, until She can handle the work load and the needs of being a LVT. Insurance is another kick in the butt, Diana will be without insurance until She can do the minimum required to be able to go back on her policy at Work. So, yet more out of pocket expenses, a pocket that is basically empty at this point.   - After everything has been added up, in order to be caught up on everything from Home to Hospital. Outstanding Bills and Therapy, comes to $8,763  This amount is to cover what Our savings was not able too. We are trying to avoid the collections calls, credit hits and Our home from being put into jeopardy. This amount will hopefully stop those collection call and late bill notices untill We can get back on our feet this Spring. We know the past year has been hard for everyone but are asking if you can find a way to donate anything, please do. We are busting our butts to get back on track and avoid foreclosure or worse.  Any help would be most appreciated.  Thank You,Diana, Rob & Dylan BrangRead more"

The 120 year old building has an amazing, sometimes spooky, history associated with it. It is currently being purchased by the Ocracoke Preservation Society (OPS), but we need your help to make our dream a reality. Over the next 6 weeks, we will share the history of the property through video vignettes on Facebook Live and You Tube. These personal tours will introduce you to this meaningful island structure, and how you can join our vision to bring it back into the lives of our visitors and residents.The Story: The dream to own the Island Inn property had been long brewing, but it wasn’t until spring of 2018 that urgency struck when the property was listed for sale with no value attributed to the building. That assessment meant that whoever bought it would most likely tear it down and repopulate the property with, well, anything. Ocracoke is a historic community, and the Ocracoke Preservation Society was anxious to keep this structure from being wiped off the map of the village. We created a community-based committee and negotiated a 5-year promise that the 3% and 2% occupancy boards would together cover the cost of the mortgage while OPS worked to find more permanent and secure funding for raising and restoring the building.Flash forward a year and a half. The project was taking shape when Hurricane Dorian slammed into Ocracoke Island, shocking us all with a record tidal surge 2.5 feet higher than any previous storm. The Odd Fellows Lodge as well as over 400 other houses on the island experienced catastrophic flooding. Suddenly all available financial and physical resources shifted to aid island residents. The Ocracoke Preservation Society gladly deferred attention during this time. Clearly, resident recovery was vital.Six months after Hurricane Dorian, Covid entered everyone’s life, shutting down tourism to Ocracoke, revenue to the museum, and reconstruction plans for the Odd Fellows Lodge. Now, three years after we began our journey, we are starting to make visible progress on the restoration. But we need your help.The Vision: OPS sees the Odd Fellows Lodge and grounds as community space. We are envisioning a Visitor Center where local nonprofits can showcase their mission and goods to visitors and as a starting point for cultural orientation to the spirit of Ocracoke. The accompanying green space, the Island Inn Park, would have room for outdoor events, a fig tree garden, public restrooms, and more. Think of it as an oasis for community activities in the heart of the village.The goal: We need to raise at least a million dollars to make this project a reality. We are starting this campaign to raise $60,000 to make progress toward that goal. It is a critical starting point to secure and stabilize this historic property and building.

A vibrant 29 year old woman, with a heart of gold and a full life ahead of her. She has lived in Winfield, BC, with her family all her life. For those of you that know her, know that Ashley and her family have suffered more than their fair share of losses and tragedy. Losing her dad suddenly almost 3 years ago, her uncle prior to that to cancer, her mom had a stroke after the passing of her dad, and her aunt passing this past summer. Needless to say, the Paxman’s have been through a lot, no one could have imagined tragedy would strike again so soon. On the evening of February 18th Ashley Paxman was walking home from work, when she was the victim of a hit and run, less than ten minutes from home. What should have been a simple, quick walk home from work turned in to a horrific tragedy. This is a girl who works 2 jobs, and has worked her entire life. The person who found Ashley saw a backpack & shoe on the road, and then discovered Ashley unrecognizable lying in the ditch. She had been hit so hard the impact knocked her out of her shoes. Now Ashley lay unresponsive on life support in the ICU. After spending the day in surgery, doctors are hopeful for recovery, although it will be a long painful road, with more surgeries ahead. There is still uncertainty as to whether her eye can be saved and regain normal function. Ashley’s brain continues to bleed, threatening long term damage, the bones in her entire face were shattered and she will have lasting nerve damage. The doctors have been able to reconstruct her fingers and repair her tongue; her jaw will be wired shut in the near future as she awaits a second surgery to repair the extensive damage. At this time the driver who hit Ashley has been in contact with police. There is not a lot of hope that financial aid will be forthcoming through insurance, and financial stress is sure to accumulate. We ask for your support in any way possible for this young lady. Prayers and financial aid are welcomed. Funds raised will be used to aid in Ashley’s extensive recovery, equipment required for rehabilitation and the rehabilitation itself. Let’s not add financial burden on top of this. We appreciate your much needed prayers.Read more"

He is 23 years old and just like many young people in the Philippines, he works just to help his family make ends meet. On 05/13/20, he went into his graveyard shift as a surveillance security worker like any other normal work day. But, this work day proved to be so much different, life changing, and life threatening for Jayson. On this unexpected night, Jayson left his graveyard shift on his motorcycle at 4AM and never made it home. Around 7AM, Jayson’s critical body was found in a nearby canal with severe trauma to his head and body. His face was shattered and completely unrecognizable. Due to the restrictions with COVID-19, Jayson was unable to get the immediate medical care he needed. Emergency medical attention was impossible due to the current lockdown and the private hospital required unfeasible monetary costs for his struggling family. Fortunately, with the help of some family and friends, Jayson was able to get the emergency medical care he needed to help him survive the damages from the accident. However, this journey has just begun. Jayson is lucky to be alive but this young man now has a lifetime of challenges ahead of him. The Chan family is requesting for donations to support Jayson’s immense medical bills and to provide him and his family resources to his medical recovery. We understand the challenges we are all faced today, but if you have the means, please donate and share. We pray for Jayson’s full recovery. Thank you for your support.Read more"

Support for Allen SunI’m setting this up to support one of my best friends, Allen Sun, who on 5/19/20 Tuesday morning is facing felony charges under California’s oppressive “Assault Weapons” laws. These laws have turned hundreds of thousands of law-abiding Californians into criminals over the years.The situation took place in his home Tuesday morning, when his landlords were having a marital dispute. Police were dispatched to the residence in search for the husband, who had already left the house. Allen, being the only person at the house, woke up to police at the front door at 2am. He had politely told them that the husband was not home and mentioned he was just a tenant living in the house. Police made their way into the residence “in order to verify it was safe”, disregarding Allen's statements and the fact that there were two missing cars in the driveway. Upon investigation of the property, they stumbled across Allen’s room which contained all his prized collections of firearms. Although Allen was not involved with the initial call, police collected and seized all of Allen’s firearm possessions, including guns which are 100% legal within California’s gun laws and several other semi automatic rifles that were legal prior to the unconstitutional laws.

I’ve known Allen for over 10 years. He’s an incredibly intelligent Cal Poly Pomona Aerospace Engineering student and he has always had a passion for the science related. As a prominent member within many Asian-American shooting sport groups, he regularly participated at gun ranges both to teach newcomers how to shoot safely and to enjoy the company of like minded enthusiasts, including several police officers from San Bernardino Sheriffs and local police. This whole situation has caused a lot of stress and anxiety for him, facing California’s unconstitutional laws on top of losing nearly $40,000 worth of high end firearms and accessories.Unfortunately, he faces a tall order against California’s DOJ system and this GoFundMe is intended for his lawyer’s retainer, court fees, and recovery of his assets. This GoFundMe has NO intention on buying firearms and is just for his LEGAL DEFENSE.

Because of popular request... If you want to support Allen directly, his Venmo is @ALLENSUN

God Bless you all!

Due to COVID 19, unemployment and a divorce, Tish needs your assistance for medical treatment to help her tackle Stage 4 Breast Cancer Metastases in the bones.Tish Vanoni isone of the strongest womenI know, battling things over many years that most human beings would not have the capability to handle. Her confidence that God will guide her through this next chapter is relentless!To say she is an onion with so many layers of depth, a zest for life, a strength for seeing the positive side in everything she has faced and the love for everyone around her is an understatement. However, the book of her life has taken a turn, yet again, since 2015. Her cancer has come back...again.Her story continues with a new chapter...For those of you unaware of her chapters since 2015, I offer a brief recap:Chapter 1:In February of 2015 she was diagnosed withStage I Breast Cancer after she found a lump. With her faith in God, the love of her 2 young boys and family and friends, she was able to find the strength to endure several rounds of chemotherapy and multiple surgeries to successfully say she was cancer-free! However, she was physically and mentally exhausted. Yet, she never showed it. Always faithful. Always strong. Always living life to the fullest. Heropposition and attitude about cancer always left me in awe.Chapter 1a:She decided, because of her age and to be proactive with her health, to undergo genetic testing. It was discovered that she has the BRCA2 gene which ""basically"" increases her risk of developing certain cancers three-fold. Because of this knowledge, she decided to make the difficult decision to have a double mastectomy. She believed this would have reduced her risk of developing breast cancer in the future. Having this gene also presents a greater risk for Ovarian, Prostate (in males) and Melanoma risk. She also decided to prevent Ovarian cancer by undergoing a Bilateral Oophorectomy. What was conveniently left out of explanation was that by removing all breasts she would be more likely to have Breast Cancer metastases somewhere less easily spotted.Chapter 1b: After her surgery, the oncologist called to let her know the tumor had been sent to the lab after removal and she had a medium risk for metastases. He recommended she do chemotherapy to reduce that risk. She didn't want to but she figured he was an oncologist for 20+ years and knew more about cancer than she did. Because of this, she got her head shaved and did chemo surrounded by many friends and family along the way.Chapter 1c: In December of 2015 she underwent the Bilateral Oophorectomy and in January of 2016 was declared ''cancer-free"".Chapter 2:In June of 2015, during a CT scan after her mastectomy, they spotted something in her neck that they wanted to watch. In January of 2016 they asked her to come in for an ultrasound and a biopsy. She did and was shocked when she received a call telling her she had THYROID Cancer. In quiet desperation, she cried and begged for guidance. It didn't feel like anything she had done had protected her or healed her. She was certain there must be another way. A friend introduced her to the Gerson Therapy. She chose to do this therapy and for 2 years juiced heavily, ate organically a special Gerson diet and detoxed with multiple coffee enemas daily. Within 4 months she had a PET scan that was clear. Dr. after Dr. called and congratulated her on being cancer-free even though they didn't understand where her cancer had gone as she had not let them surgically remove her thyroid. She had chosen not to pursue surgery as it felt like the 2 surgeries the previous year combined with the chemo should have kept her safe but had not. She knew she needed to find a different approach to curing this cancer and put her body into a zone that would allow her to live a healthy, cancer-free life in the future. With the financial support of her family and friends, she found this outside of the United States. She continued after the initial PET scan to finish the 2-year treatment through Feb. of 2018. She continued to get a yearly PET scan and bloodwork to make sure it was kept at bay.Chapter 3 (the new chapter):Starting her new life as a single mom (enjoying her 2 boys finally), during a recent routine pet scan in February 2021, she received the diagnosis of stage 4 Breast Cancer that has metastasized to her bones. Her spirit has not broken. But, again at the young age of 46, she needs to follow her path of healing to again put this cancer at bay.Unfortunately, due to COVID and other factors, she finds herself unable to carry the financial burden of this. She feels confident that this is but another chapter in her story and not her last. With the love of her boys and God's guidance to her recovery, she needs your help. We are asking for this so that she can seek the medical therapies to beat this and continue to finance the therapies she is already undergoing at home. $65,000 is the amount the clinic and Tish determined would be needed. If anyone can do it, Tish can.Thank youfor your consideration and faith in her journey!Read more"

She has just been released to go home, but the road to recovery will be a long one.Her condition is currently stable, but she is suffering from partial blindness in her right eye,along with confusion and partial memory loss. She is currently not able to walk unassisted, and has been re-learning basic life skills such as how to eat, walk and moving her body with a steady regiment of physical therapy.She is going to need extensive therapy going forward and although she shows many signs of progress, she will need extensive out-patient care to help repair the damage from the stroke.Cheryl is receiving 3-5 hours of out-patient rehab each day, which will include speech, physical, and occupational therapy.She will also need future brain surgery to repair the three remaining aneurysms as well as a possible surgery on her right eye that could help restore her vision.She and her fiance' Rick Long are grateful for the outpouring of love and support that Cheryl has received thus far.

A lot of you know the Amery’s – Phil, Sarah, Luca and Dylan. Wherever they go this beautiful little family brings a loving warmth with them that is infectious. Whether it be Crossfit, Strongman or riding the Amery’s quickly become an important, distinctive, and loved part of the community they involve themselves in.Most people by now have heard the news and like me have wanted to do anything they can during this time, but unfortunately we cannot take away the heartbreak, make the Tumour disappear or be there (COVID19 >< ), but what we can do is help financially. That is why along with the backing of these above communities I have decided to create this “Gofundme” so that those who have been lucky enough to be a part of this little family’s life can help during their most difficult time.In an instant life can change and this is what happened 3 days ago for 10 year old Luca.After Luca had a fall Monday evening resulting in a concussion Sarah being the diligent Mother she is took him to ED to get checked. It was during this check up that the Doctors found a large tumour on his Brain. Luca was stabilised at Lismore Base Hospital by the medical team prior to being flown to Brisbane Children’s Hospital that night with thanks to the Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter. Due to the location of the Tumour, it is impending on the ability for the fluid around his brain to drain and causing pressure.On Tuesday Luca had an EVD drain put into his skull to relive the pressure due to the fluid build-up. The next surgery is scheduled towards the end of the week on Saturday.This is only the beginning of Luca and the family’s journey to recovery and there is a lot of unknown, however Luca is strong and is lucky to be in the care of an amazing team at Brisbane Mater Hospital who have a plan to tackle this with him. The next coming days and weeks are going to be incredibly difficult for the family with needing to take time off work, pay for accommodation, medical bills, food, general living costs, care for Dylan, and rehabilitation down the track. I would love if we could all get together as a community and do what we can to alleviate some of this financial stress so that Mum and Dad can focus all of their energy on simply their little boys’ recovery.Thank you and we will continue posting updates when we know more…

Ever since Loki has been part of the family, he loves striking up conversations with anyone who walks through the door, and can play fetch 24/7 if he was able to.

In September of 2020 she suffered an ischemic stroke. The stroke affected the left side of the brain causing right side weakness and impacting speech abilities, memory & cognition, and activities of daily living. She is currently unable to walk and requires assistance with activities such as eating and dressing.Our mother was ordered to have physical, speech, & occupational therapy, including rehab at a Long Term Care nursing rehabilitation facility in our hometown of Maryland. This is where she has received treatment since November 2020. However two weeks ago, we were told by the facility that my mother would suddenly need to be discharged due to citizenship status and a policy that requires at least 5 years green card holding status in order to receive medicaid for Long Term Care. Treatment which my mother so desperately needs and a policy we were not made aware of when we entered the facility in November.My mother is NOT in this country illegally. She has employment authorization permitting her to legally work in the States, she has worked as a nurse & caregiver, paying taxes for over 30 years, she has children who are U.S citizens, including myself who is her petitioner for permanent resident status. We have been through all our legal processing for permanent status- I can attest to the unfortunate years of delayed ""pending"" application process many immigrants like my mother face in this country. Due to new policies put in place, including a sudden suspension on issuing green cards, many immigrants find themselves in positions like the one my family and I currently are in.We are now asking for your help so our mother can receive private out-of-pocket care. This treatment will include full-time care at a residential assisted living facility: room + board, 24-hour nursing assistance, and physical + occupational therapy, totaling $65,000 for one year. This amount is an estimate given the monthly costs + expenses at the residential facility as well as continued physical therapy for a year. It does not include the three months of medical bills charged by the nursing home issuing the discharge, which we were told medicaid would not cover.As my family does not have the means to cover these costs, any donation would be greatly appreciated. If you are unable to donate, please feel welcomed to share this campaign with anyone who may be able to help. Our mother has helped so many and we are happy to give back to her in this way. We thank you as your support will help our mother receive the care & treatment she needs, get back on her feet, and back with her family. Infinite gratitude.Read more"

Late Saturday (2/27) night Jeff’s parents arrived home to find him very disoriented, confused, and he complained of a severe headache. They took him to the Kadlec ER where he received a CT scan revealing that he had an aneurysm that had burst.

The neurosurgeon put in a drain to help relieve some of the pressure in his brain prior to themtransferring him by LifeFlight to Sacred Heart ICU.

There he underwent surgery to clip the aneurysm. Surgery went well and Jeff was following the nurse’s commands the next morning.They next 10 days will be very crucial in his recovery! They planned on weaning him off of the sedation enough to extubate (remove the breathing tube) him over the next 2 days. BUT, Jeff caught the nurse with her back turned and pulled the tube out himself (today, 3/1). He is now is soft restraints and re sedated to let his brain heal and make sure he doesn’t pull out anymore lines or drains!!The Cobb family has given more to our community, and many other communities, for as many years as we can remember.

I started this gofundme to assist Oscar with financial stress while he recovers physically and mentally from the attack after so many have reached out asking if there’s any way they can help.

There is no safe space until these kinds of people are brought to justice and acts of hate crime are held at the degree they should be. Everyone stay vigilant and stay safe, take care of yourself and others always.

Once again we can’t express enough thanks for the intense love and family we have felt since the incident. Our community is our family, never forget ❤️

(Credit: Keith Barraclough)Cut Red Tape 4 Heroes is a project of Art Science Research Laboratory. There’s no time to wait to fundraise first in a crisis. So ASRL’s founder Rhonda Roland Shearer went ahead, borrowed money, and started buying hundreds of thousands of dollars of hard-to-find PPEs for our first responders and healthcare heroes. Now we must raise money to pay the bills.Our experience: After Sept. 11, Rhonda sprung into action and started a similar program for Ground Zero first responders, supplying desperately needed PPEs for NYC city uniform services and raising millions of dollars from foundations. We are uniquely able to find and distribute PPEs and other supplies because of experience as the main WTC supply operation for city uniform services for the entire 9/11 recovery operation. Back in the first days of Ground Zero operations, my not-for-profit first operated out of the back of a truck to deliver respirators and other PPEs directly into first responders' hands, as widely documented in foundation and news reports.WTC Ground Zero Relief was Art Science Research Laboratory’s emergency response project that provide PPE for uniform services (NYPD, FDNY, PAPD) at the nine month Ground Zero cleanup after 9/11.Bios:Rhonda Roland Shearer, an artist, scholar and award-winning journalist, provided Charles King, Housing Works’ longtime director, with original funding and start-up space for Housing Works in 1990 in her art studio, and later started Housing Works Thrift Shop. Shearer is a philanthropist and director of Art Science Research Laboratory, a 501 (c) (3) not-for-profit that she co-founded with her late husband, Harvard professor and scientist, Stephen Jay Gould.Shearer borrowed nearly one million dollars to buy PPE's for 9/11 first responders who also did not have proper safety equipment. Through ASRL, a private family foundation, she later raised millions of dollars to pay the vendor bills for the WTC Ground Zero Relief Project. She is again using borrowed money to secure personal protective equipment for workers responding to the coronavirus pandemic in New York City. ASRL publishes numerous websites including the award-winning iMediaEthics media ethics news website, the NASA Astrobiology Magazine (now just an archive), and the art research website Tout Fait.com. The legendary philanthropist Paul Mellon gave approximately $2 million to originally fund ASRL.Housing Works is a NYC-based non-profit whose mission is to end the dual crises of homelessness and AIDS through relentless advocacy, the provision of lifesaving services, and entrepreneurial businesses that sustain their efforts. Housing Works is on the front lines of the COVID-19 response efforts. They are currently serving low-income New Yorkers through their community healthcare clinics, housing programs, & integrated case management, and are currently operating an emergency shelter for homeless New Yorkers with COVID-19.Volunteers, including founder Rhonda Roland Shearer, in the Cut Red Tape 4 Heroes van on the way to hand out PPE to public housing residents at Jackson Houses (Credit: Dominic Colacchio)For more information or any questions, contact:Questions, donations & corporate donations, contact: [email redacted], [phone redacted]Media inquiries, contact [email redacted] and [email redacted], [phone redacted]Volunteer: https://bit.ly/CutRedTapeVolsFacebook Twitter InstagramChecks can be addressed to Art Science Research Laboratory and mailed to:Art Science Research Laboratory 62 Greene St. 3rd Floor, New York, NY 10012Cut Red Tape 4 Heroes handed out PPE to residents of River Park Towers, which was called the ""death towers"" in a New York Times article because of COVID cases.

Carly is a Chesapeake Bay Retriever that was found wandering around a neighborhood in Dearborn on May 1st. She was severely malnourished, smelled horribly, and was in obvious pain. With no tags, collar, and no microchip, we picked her up, and quickly got her posted on as many sites as possible to find her owner. Nobody has come forward as her owner, and we had to take her to the vet right away. Our group of friends pitched in to cover her initial vet bills, food, and medicine, totaling a bit over $350. This covered a bag of food, beds, antibiotics, steroids, ear cleaning, drops, supplies, as well as her initial vet visit.From this trip to the vet, we discovered that her smell came from her severely infected ears. She also has a 360 degree stricture in her rectum, making sitting uncomfortable, and defecating very painful. Once she started her antibiotics, steroids, daily ear drops and cleaning, she got a great boost of energy. She started playing, smiling, and showing love to the people who saved her and have taken her in as their own. This young family will be her forever home assuming nobody comes forward with evidence of ownership.On May 4th she backslid slightly, and was shying away from food and was unable to use the restroom. We knew this was a serious issue, and rushed her to an emergency vet. They took X-rays, radiographs, and examined her extensively, as well as administered an injection to alleviate her inflammation. She is currently in veterinary care, being sedated and administered IV nutrients to help her malnutrition. While under sedation, she will be given an enema as well as further investigation into the cause of her rectal stricture. Upon completing this procedure, we will hopefully find out if she needs surgery or will be able to recover on her own

This latest visit alone costs $1,000, and there are likely more expensive bills to come. We know that this sweet, young dog is so worth every penny, and we are hoping the community can help us provide the special care that she needs to make a full recovery.We are filing all expenses to verify that every cent of this fundraiser goes toward her care, and will make these official vet records public for everyone to verify their legitimacy and make sure this campaign is fully transparent. In addition, if we take in any excess of funds, they will be donated to local animal shelters in Metro Detroit, beginning with Detroit Dog Rescue.

She wanted to make sure everyone knew that she was going to be special, and special she is! At 33 weeks and some change, Kaitee was admitted with high blood pressure and tested positive for preterm labor. She and Jeff knew the goal was to keep her BP down so Raegan could do some more baking. Unfortunately, during her 34 week ultrasound, it was discovered that Kaitee had excess amniotic fluid building up (known as polyhydramnios) and that Baby Raegan had a distended belly, likely caused by a bowel obstruction. However, the goal hadn't changed: keep Kaitee's blood pressure down, monitor Sweet Baby Rae's heartbeat and stats, and keep that bun in the oven! On 8/27, Kaitee and Jeff had a discussion with Dr. Crisp to schedule a c-section at week 36, buying Baby Rae some time to develop, but also relieving Kaitee's discomfort, as the amniotic fluid just kept building up. Dr. Crisp however was pleased with Kaitee's BP and her progress so far, and he wanted to aim for week 37. As you all know, Raegan Renee had other plans. With Kaitee's blood pressure not decreasing and her blood work coming back somewhat worrisome, Dr. Crisp changed his mind and made the professional decision that it was no longer beneficial to Mom or Baby to continue the pregnancy. And so, we were all blessed with Raegan Renee Rehkopf! And now, the reason I am telling you all this...if you know Kaitee & Jeff, you know they are the last people to ask for help. However, with their permission, I am asking for them. Raegan was transferred to Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara just hours after her birth. Jeffrey was able to accompany Sweet Baby Rae, while Kaitee has to stay at Marian to recover. Raegan will have to undergo surgery later this week, and then have a week or more recovery time. Santa Barbara is 70 miles from Jeff and Kaitee's home and gas money, lodging to be close to their baby girl, and meals away from home are just some expenses that they will have to endure to provide a comforting environment for Baby Rae. I would like to ask that anyone who could spare some change, do so with a loving heart. Even the littlest bit can help make a difference in this young family's life as they are adjusting to new life as parents. ""Though she be but little, she is fierce!""Read more"

The water rushed through their shed and laundry room, and three rooms and a hallway on the second level was covered in a few inches of water and now mud.

Every month Robert needs to travel to MD Anderson in Houston in order to get the monthly treatment that has extended his life beyond the life expectancy for people with his very rare leukenia. Each monthly trip costs at least $1,500 and is not covered by insurance. In addition Robert has had his monthly pension payout reduced by $1300 making these necessary life extending treatment beyond his means.

 Robert Gillespie is a single dad who has been battling cancer since 2012, when he was diagnosed with a very rare leukemia. He needs your help to continue to fight for his life and provide for his 11-year-old son, Marco. This type of blood cancer is incurable but can be slowed by very aggressive chemotherapy, which has left him with permanent physical damage and unable to work, which in turn has affected his health insurance and his expenses. Complications with this cancer include organ damage and weakening the body’s ability to fight other cancers. This forced Robert to undergo heart surgery, while the development of two new cancers necessitated surgeries to remove large tumors from his face and colon. Because of the rarity of his cancer, Robert began receiving treatment at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, which has the leading experts in his type of cancer. In fall 2016, he spent weeks in the hospital and made a recovery from what his doctors thought were terminal complications. In 2017, doctors began to suspect that his cancer had triggered the onset of ALS, which is still being confirmed, making walking and daily activities difficult. Robert's illness has affected his three biggest passions: being a single dad to the amazing Marco, traveling, and his involvement with DC United. Within soccer circles, he is called ""Big Rob,"" a well-known member of the DC United supporters’ community since 1996. As one of the elders of the Barra Brava, Rob's unmistakable presence on the sidelines of matches has been one of the most enduring images of DC's fanbase. Away from matches, Rob has been deeply involved with countless charity fundraising events by both DC United and DCU supporters groups, including raising money for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. His illness necessitated a move to Oregon in 2016, to get help from family to take care of Marco. His treatment, the limits of health insurance, and the cost of taking care of himself and his son have chewed up all his savings. His pension is roughly half his former income and his life savings has vanished. In 2018, he lost his health insurance and was forced to suspend treatment in order to try and avoid losing his home and car. We want to make sure Robert gets back into treatment so he is around for Marco as long as possible. In the fall of 2018, he has three trips to Houston scheduled, including a surgery. We’re trying to raise money to help Rob with uncovered costs for his ongoing care and for living expenses for himself and his son. Diagnostic tests alone on these trips range from $4,500-$12,000 which even when he had insurance could be $2,500 out of pocket. Out-of-pocket costs for monthly treatment can be as high as $18,000 depending on length of stay. Travel alone can be $1,500+. If you know Robert at all, you know of his generosity for others. Now is our chance to be generous to him. Please do what you can to help! #TuPutaMadreCancer Read more"

Hi everyone....So recently my pretty girl Ivy started having trouble standing on her back legs which started causing her excruciating pain/discomfort. We took her to the vet where they told us the reason Ivy is experiencing so much pain was due to her havingIVDD (Intervertebral disc disease). So in order for Ivy to walk again she needs to have surgery & then therapy for her recovery which will cost over      $7000 . Due to everything going on right now with COVID-19 my family aren’t able to afford all her surgery/treatment at this time .

We are from Kaplan, Louisiana. These donations will be used to provide Holden with day to day needs. As of now, we are paying for home care assistance. Holden does not have the use of his hands; therefore, he needs support 24/7. 


Holden is the most loving and caring person on Earth. Holden is a 2019 Graduate from Kaplan High school. He is a student at LSUE, where he was majoring in education. Holden is an optimistic and strong young man. Holden is a proud member and advocate of the LGBTQ community. Holden loves competing in speech competitions and expressing who he is! Unfortunately, Holden fell victim to what the family believes is a hate crime on June 20th, 2020, at around 11 pm. Holden was lured to the residence of another young man. This young man proceeded to physically torture and harm Holden for several hours until authorities arrived on the scene. The culprit physically hurt Holden in unspeakable ways. Holden has severe lacerations to both wrists, stab wounds, and lacerations to his neck and was found unconscious. He will need intense physical therapy, emotional therapy, many prayers, and love. Any donations towards Holden’s recovery would be much appreciated; he has a long road of healing ahead of him. No donation is too small, and if you are not financially able to donate, prayers are equally as appreciated. God was with Holden, and we know that God will continue to be with Holden through his recovery. 

-your big sister and forever friend. Sista loves you so much Holden, and we will get through this ❤️Read more"

BRING DARLA HOMEDarla is a 5 year old Blue Merle Australian Shepherd and to know her is to love her.

While her parents were gone during the evening on July 4th, Darla was abnormally scared ofthe fireworks going on outside. Her mom watched her from her doggy camera to make sure she was okay and when she noticed she was not okay, Caitlin and Billy Barnes decided to go home and comfort her.

When they got home Darla had pushed out panels for a window air conditioner and jumped out and ran away. Darla is 5 years old and has never exhibited this behavior in the past.

Her Mom and Dad, Caitlin and Billy Barnes, are absolutely distraught and have done everything they can to try to find her on their own. They have driven around a 5 mile radius around their home and are passing out over 500 flyers.

We live in a small country town in the mountains so she could be out in the miles of woods around us.

I want to help bring Darla home soon.

EPIC Animal Recovery helps people track their lost dogs with their amazing scent tracking dogs. Time is of the essence and we need to start this process as soon as possible. We are hopeful that this will bring Darla home.

Caitlin works full time as a mentor at a local residential treatment center for at risk teens, is going to grad school to become a school counselor and constantly gives back to her community. This is an opportunity for the community to give back to her and her husband to bring home their baby.

Every $1 donation helps and we are so eternally grateful. We know times are tough for everyone and the world can be a scary place - dogs make it better. If you are unable to donate please consider sharing Darla's story.

Lauren has regained sensation throughout her body and minor movement in both hands and feet. She is working hard at physical therapy 5 days a week and is getting stronger physically and mentally each day. She is committed to doing whatever it takes to recover, so she can get back being a mother in full form.



The Berg family is beyond grateful for your support. Thank you for being a part of Lauren’s journey.
Lauren’s Story:On Sunday, October 4th, our most beloved and beautiful family member and friend, Lauren Shmalo Berg, was in a critical accident. She fell down a flight of steps and suffered severe trauma to her neck and spine.Lauren was administered CPR and air lifted to Miami Valley Hospital where she underwent an 8 hour surgery following the incident.Lauren has spent the past week in the Intensive Care Unit, away from her kids, attempting to recover. She will soon be transported to the University of Cincinnati Daniel Drake Rehabilitation Center to begin the recovery process of regaining feeling and functionality in her arms and legs.As we all know, Lauren is as much a force as she is a guiding light for so many of us, including her husband Justin, two year old daughter Lia and three month old son Isaac. Lauren is dynamic, she is empathetic and she is, without a doubt, a survivor.Lauren has always prided herself on others in need and now can use your help. The health care, child care and other living costs will be extensive.


As Lauren told us before and after her surgery, “I WILL walk again.” While Lauren has always been a dazzling cheerleader for so many, it is now our opportunity to be hers. Please help Lauren make this a reality by making a contribution to her success.Organized by Lauren’s long time best friends and and champions, Erica Cohen -Biscotti and Cyvia Star

My name is Gregory Arellano and I'm starting this GoFundMe to go to the family of Justin Howell, a fellow Texas State student who was critically injured by Austin Police during protests Sunday, May 31st

Justin was hit by a rubber bullet and has a fractured skull as well as brain damage that, according to his brother Joshua, will lead to an extensive recovery effort.

The Austin Police Department has already admitted wrongdoing by ""accidentally"" shooting Justin instead of a protester who was close by and allegedly threw a backpack and/or a water bottle.

Upon dragging him to the police station as ordered by police, Justin as well as the five other protesters were fired upon by the Austin police department.

I'm struggling to find the appropriate resources within our state to demand that the Austin police department be held accountable for this, and while I don't know Justin or his family, I do know that he could've easily been any of us.

The following are words by Joshua over his brother's shooting by police. Please offer whatever assistance you can as we wish for speedy health, recovery, and justice for Justin.



""His name is Justin Howell. And he is my little brother.As this columnhas arguedbefore, if you really want to know what happened, there is no substitute for theraw, unedited video. In it, you will see five people carrying Justin’s limp body toward police headquarters, begging the officers to get him medical attention. As they do, the police fire some 15 rounds (many of which were at the protesters carrying my brother) over the course of about 30 seconds.“What the f---?” one of them yells.Exactly.Because the five people carrying Justin weren’t “begging” to get him medical attention — at least not in the typical sense. According to Chief of Police Brian Manley in arecent press briefing, the protesters “were given direction to bring [Justin] to the officers” after which the demonstrators “were fired upon with less-lethal munitions as they brought [Justin] towards the officers to get him medical help.”Think about that. It’s unclear whether the officers who shot at the protesters were the same ones who gave them the order to approach. But at minimum, it takes a special kind of incompetence to fire at those who are doing as the police tell them. At minimum, it shows a complete inability to be aware of your surroundings and to manage the situation appropriately.There is no better evidence that here in Austin, Texas, the police are entirely out of their depth.I confirmed Manley’s account with a man named David Frost over Twitter. He was the one who filmed the aforementioned video, and he was able to provide me with another picture of my brother shortly after being hit. In the photo, his body is splayed upon the ground. Onlookers are rushing to his side.In our brief interview, Frost told me that “other protesters were throwing rocks, water bottles, and a backpack. [Justin] was not. The chief of police even said on Facebook live today. They shot the WRONG person.”Indeed, Manley did admit as much during his briefing. But it’s worth considering that this is the world in which we live: If the police tell you something, it’s best to get a second source to confirm its accuracy.It’s also notable in his briefing how little effort Manley puts into taking responsibility for what happened. No, reader, I haven’t omitted the part of Manley’s statement where he seems contrite. There was no apology. Instead, he sat at his desk for three full minutes, gave us the details above and at no point apologized to my brother, my family or the five brave protesters who carried Justin to police headquarters under fire. (To those protesters: My family sees you, and we thank you.)And what is somehow worse, Manley concludes his remarks by saying: “We are praying for this young man and his family and we are hoping that his condition improves quickly. ”To which my family, a deeply religious one, says this: We aren’t interested in your prayers. We are interested in you appropriately using the responsibilities with which the people of Austin have entrusted you. Prayer is not an excuse to abdicate responsibility.And responsible you are. Because Justin won’t be improving quickly. “It will be a marathon, not a sprint,” according to one of his doctors.He has a fractured skull. He has brain damage. Doctors anticipate that when he wakes up, he will have difficulty telling his left from his right.These “less-lethal” munitions are only “less-lethal” by technicality. My brother’s condition shows what can happen when you fire them into a crowd.Earlier this week, the Austin-American Statesman reported that the Austin City Council “will hold an emergency hearing [on Thursday] to address concerns about officer’s response to racial justice protests over the weekend and to address what they see as little cooperation from Austin police leadership to transform policies.”We shall see if anything comes of it. Expect suggestions in a later column.""

I'd love to start off by telling you her story. Hannah was born smack dab in the middle of a terrible storm to my son Jacob Daisley and daughter in law Christine Daisley, resulting in her nickname Hurricane Hannah, and boy did she ever live up to that name. On February 14th 2014, she was taken to McMaster Children's hospital because her parents had noticed something wasn't right. At seven months old she was diagnosed with a rare form of epilepsy. This started her long, and very difficult journey with daily seizures, medications, surgeries, specialist appointments, therapies etc. As a result Hannah is nonverbal and extremely developmentally delayed. Cognitively she functions at the level of an eighteen month old.Living through what Hannah's had to go through is enough to break any person's spirit, but not our warrior. For anyone who has ever had the pleasure to meet my little love dove knows just how true this is. Her infectious laugh and her larger than life smile will brighten any room she enters. Hannah is known for her amazing heart-melting hugs and kisses, and they act as a form of therapy for all her loved ones.She has undergone two minimally invasive brain surgeries in the last two years to determine that she is a candidate for a right-sided hemispherectomy which she will be undergoing on March 25th of this year. This is a serious, life-altering and invasive surgery that will hopefully stop her seizures. However, it will leave Hannah with vision loss and left-sided paralysis that will require extensive rehabilitation. The recovery process will start at Holland Bloorview Inpatient Rehab, and will require both Jacob and Christine to be off of work for at least six months.Afterwards, she will continue her recovery at home which will require medical supplies and equipment, as well as home renovations to accommodate her needs. Unfortunately with both parents off work and having two other small children, the financial situation is dire. That is why I am creating this fundraiser because I want them to be able to help Hannah recover without the financial burden. The money donated will be used by Jacob and Christine to help with transportation back and forth to Toronto, Hannahs medical needs and her continued rehabilitation once home. Any amount, no matter how big or small is SO appreciated and if you aren't able to donate please consider sharing. Much love from my family to yours.-KellyRead more"

My name is Ashley and I work with Juanita at REMSA dispatch. Our center is basically our second family, so when anyone is dealing with life events, we try to support one another as much as possible. Juanita was told early on in her pregnancy that she was high risk and had been diagnosed with placenta previa. She has been in and out of the hospital numerous times throughout her pregnancy and was more recently admitted on February 28th. Due to complications, Juanita had an emergency delivery on March 13th, giving birth to sweet baby girl Emmorie, who was delivered at only 28 weeks developed and weighing about 2 lbs 10 oz. Mom and baby are both stable at the hospital right now, but both have a long road to recovery. Juanita should be able to return home later this week as long as there are no further complications, but baby Emmorie will be remaining in the hospital until her estimated due date of June 4th at the very earliest.Obviously, with all of this medical care comes MANY expenses, not to mention all of the missed time at work before Emmorie was even delivered. Juanita is currently the sole financial provider for her family and has already been struggling to make ends meet. This is where we can step in and provide Juanita with some assistance - if you are able to donate ANY amount of money, I know that it will be greatly appreciated and so helpful to this family of four. I know we won't be able to completely take away all of the medical expenses, but if we can at least provide her with money to get through this recovery period, it would give her one less thing to be stressed about. We want Juanita to focus on the recovery of baby Emmorie and herself as much as possible <3Again, thank you so much for taking time out of your day to read this.

To honor his legacy we ask that you help us reach our goal of raising $2,600 in his memory for an organization committed to the rescue and wellbeing of animals. Now is a difficult time for many, unfortunately due to job loss there are pet owners forced to surrender their animals to shelters due to inability to afford cost of food and proper care. Adoption events are not able to take place and the need for funding to support animal rescue organizations continues to grow. We hope to make a small impact in his name to recognize his birthday.Growing up our home was always full of chaos and noise because of the animals within it. Many of these animals were there at the insistence and persistence of Bryan. When he was away at school he would send pictures of a puppy to our parents and when asked whom the puppy belonged to he would respond stating he was 'dog sitting for a friend'. This dog sitting gig would turn out to be permanent and the real story would be that it was his latest rescue from the local shelter. This happened more than once. During one Christmas break when he was home from college the number of dogs in our home peaked at 5 (see photo) despite Gus' preference of 'no more dogs'! Bryan's love of animals and commitment to rescue lives on in our family today. Gus has even warmed to [re: tolerates] Bryan's dogs Miley and Gotti who still live with our parents.


While many small organizations are hit hard during this global pandemic we have decided to donate to the ASPCA as they are equipped with the appropriate structure for allocating funds to organizations hardest hit and most in need, information about their COVID-19 response and commitment to funding shelters/rescues listed below.https://www.aspca.org/about-us/press-releases/aspca-commits-5-million-covid-19-relief-recovery-initiative-help-animalMore information about ASPCA: The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) was the first humane society established in North America and is, today, one of the largest in the world.

UPDATE 3/12/2021: Today, Beth met her Lord Jesus Christ face-to-face. Please pray for Beth's family. My heart is broken for them, especially her four children. I know they covet your prayers. Any money collected will help cover funeral cost and extra needs as the family grieves the loss of such a precious woman.A dear friend and sister-in-Christ, Beth Selman, wears many hats as a wife, a mother of 4 amazing kids, and a women’s ministry leader. But unfortunately, for the last month she has been battling Covid. She has been in the hospital since February 12th. Today she was taken off the vent and had a tracheotomy done to continue her healing and treatment. This has been a long journey and is expected to take a while longer, BUT I’m continuing to believe that Jesus is working a miracle with her healing!If you know the Selman Family, you know that they have servant hearts. Their family is constantly serving others through various forms of ministry. 

Beth’s husband, Bryan, had been traveling to Alabama working prior to Covid. But he currently can’t be that far away fromthe hospital and kids. So unfortunately with Beth out of work and Bryan taking care of the kids, visiting the hospital and trying to pick up work in between, it has been extremely difficult.Many have asked, “How can I help?” So here are just a few ideas:1. Pray - set aside time each day to pray for Beth’s healing and full recovery. Pray also for her husband and her four precious children.

Be that by bursting into one of his unrivalled, amateur raps or by unleashing his inner performer on any dance floor; you could always count on Ben to be the life and soul of every party. An avid adventurer, thrill-seeker and true go-getter Ben was always the first to jump at every opportunity life had in store for him.On the 21st May 2020, at 12pm, our belovedBen bought a brand new mountain bike with the hope of continuing his love of fitness. By 3pm, that very same day, Ben had fallen from a height of 30ft and was being airlifted to our regional major trauma unit where he was placed into a medically induced coma. He hasn’t yet returned home.As a result of his accident, Ben suffered a life-changing, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and has faced major obstacles throughout his recovery. This includes life-saving brain surgery, a tracheostomy and sepsis. Ben is a 24 year-old, young man who now needs intense help in re-learning the everyday basics that many of us are probably guilty of taking for granted. Despite the amazing progress Ben has already made, he is still dependent on 24-hour care which is currently being provided at our local neuro-rehabilitation facility.Throughout his journey, Ben has proven to be an absolute fighter. However, his fight is still far from over. Due to the nature of Ben’s injury he requires a highly specialised level of rehabilitation in order to reach his optimum recovery. One of Ben’s biggest challenges is that he has not been given the opportunity to receive the intense, specialist neuro-rehabilitation he so desperately deserves. Unfortunately, this is because our local facility is not equipped with the resources to provide this. This has meant that every day has become a constant battle just to ensure Ben receives even a basic level of rehabilitative intervention. With limited resources to enhance Ben’s recovery where he currently is, we have been left with no choice but to consider funding private care and or bring Ben home to look after him ourselves. Both of these options are extremely costly.To give a small insight into the expense of facilitating these options, private neuro-rehabilitation facilities cost upwards of thousands of pounds a week and equipping our home for Ben’s return is an equally as costly endeavour. In order to enable Ben’s continued recovery at home, we will need to purchase specialist equipment, employ rehabilitation personnel and make adaptations to our home. For example, a proportion of the money raised would go towards helping us to purchase a FES bike which costs upwards of £10,000 and a Tilt Table which costs at least £2,000.As if the trauma of Ben’s accident was not enough, we have also beenleft devastated by the stringent visiting restrictions that have been imposed as a result of the current pandemic. It has meant that Ben’s immediate family have been unable to participate in this crucial phase of his recovery for many months now. This has been especially heart breaking as, from day one it has been stressed to us, by medical professionals, the positive impact that family involvement can have on a patient’s recovery.Fundraising for Ben is not something which we had initially considered but as time passes, we are desperate for Ben to be given the very best chance to live his life freely once again.We would like nothing more than to help Ben get back to the man he once was, the son we adore, the brother we miss and the partner we love. We would be eternally grateful for any contribution, no matter how big or small, made towards Ben’s recovery and hope that one day Ben will be able thank you all himself. For now, on his behalf, thank you for taking the time to read Ben’s road to recovery.Read more"

My grandson Dexter needs major open heart surgery in Great Ormond Street in London in the next 4-6 weeks.

His main issues are:

-Left Pulmonary Artery Sling-Left bronchomalacia -Left Thoracic Hypoplasia



It is a major operation that is only done less than a handful of times a year only being performed in London. Due to COVID restrictions, Mum has to be in the hospital on her own whilst the operation, induced coma and recovery happens which will take about a month. He will also need follow up appointments, operations and overnight stays for the next several months.

The condition Dexter has means his pulmonary artery is wrapped around his windpipe, making it difficult for him to breath when exerting himself, sleeping or doing normal things babies do. Any illness such as a cold renders him back in hospital due to his Airways restricting.

Desperately wanting to be there for his son & wife Rob (dad) will have to find a place as near to the hospital as possible, pay for parking for a month, food for them both and congestion and emissions charges. He will only be able to have a five minute catch up with Danielle (mum) a day if she is able to leave the hospital and no hugs/comforting her.Without everyone’s help, Danielle will have to take this whole battle in the big city on her own, and Rob won’t be able to see his son or wife for up to a month. Danielle has had to give up her career to care for Dexter, she has never been out of work since she was 15, this fundraiser will help them not have to worry so much about the financial strain they are already under.Please if anyone out there has any donations to give it would mean the world to our family and you will be helping us get through a very tough time.Any donation big or small will be much appreciated and you will have our deepest gratitude.Thank you so much for your help & support.



Any extra funds not used to fund the stay, will be donated to Arrowe Park Hospital Childrens Ward that recently looked after Dexter and family for over a month during his last hospital admission and finally listened to their concerns and acted upon it.

He is a one-year-old “lab mix” pup who was rescued from a shelter in Texas and brought to Colorado in the Spring of 2020. Upon his arrival, it was evident that something wasn’t quite right with his back legs. He avoided putting weight on them, bunny hopped around, and was quick to attain a limp after playing a little too much. Given his young age, we speculated that it was likely just some weakness from being kept in crates and shelters for such a significant portion of his puppyhood. As time went by, Freddie’s weakness and pain didn’t subside. He recently had an x-ray taken that revealed the issue is bigger than 'just some weakness.' The doctor shared that Freddie has a case of severe hip dysplasia. We don’t know if he was born with this condition or if something happened when he was younger to cause it.Hip dysplasia is a common issue in older dogs, but because Freddie is only one, it is inevitable that he is going to need some help in order to live the comfortable, happy, playful, and long life he deserves.The help he will need is quite intensive as dysplasia is not a condition that the body can heal on its own, therefore his hip joints will need to be fixed surgically. They will be fixed one hip at a time, with a 6-8 week recovery per hip.Thanks to his amazing rescue, Mile High Lab Rescue Mission, his family, and some very generous doctors at a local canine orthopedic, the cost of Freddie’s surgery is mostly covered. This surgery typically runs around $12,000 and the last bit we need to make it possible for Freddie is reflected in this gofundme.If there’s any amount you might be able to contribute to help give Freddie the hips and life he deserves, it would be SO very appreciated.

The family, including Cameryn, 13, Bailey, 12, Landon, 10, Sadie, 7, Jackson 5, and Wilson, 3 had just spent two wonderful weeks visiting close friends in Texas. As they drove down the pitch-dark highway in the middle of what seemed to be nowhere, a tragedy occurred, and they lost control of their vehicle. The Suburban veered from the road and rolled multiple times in a horrific accident that landed it upside down in an area that passing cars could not see them. The Suburban had been almost entirely crushed, leaving both Brad and Crystal, who is 7 months pregnant, and the family suspended. Unable to move, Brad was able to use voice command to access his Apple Watch to call 911 for help. Some of the children were able to release themselves from their seat belts and crawl out and made their way to the side of the road, hoping to find help. But the parents, Brad and Crystal were unable to remove themselves for over an hour.Help came but, not soon enough for everyone. Even with the help of two Life Flight helicopters and six ambulances, two of Brad and Crystal’s children could not be saved. The couple’s beautiful daughter Bailey, age 12, and their sweet son Landon, age 10, both suffered fatal injuries and are now with the Lord. Crystal was Life-flighted from the scene taken to the hospital. It took the Jaws of Life to remove Brad from the vehicle and he and the four children were rushed to two different hospitals.The family sustained a seemingly endless number of critical injuries. Brad was left with a fractured face and a broken knee. Cameryn suffered a broken clavicle and severe cuts all over her body. Crystal has suffered a punctured lung, broken ribs, a broken shoulder, and a shattered foot in addition to extreme wounds on her body. It is a miracle that six of the eight family members were able to walk away from this horrific accident. They are now beginning the slow process of recovery. Nonetheless, the excruciating physical pain and the unbearable, overwhelming grief is more than just about anyone could bare. Despite this, the family stands firm in their faith and trusts that their God will be glorified. The couple’s unborn child appears to be healthy and is maintaining a strong heartbeat. The family looks forward to welcoming the baby in October.This is a loving San Diego family that is incredibly involved in their church, putting God first before all else in their lives. Crystal is a devoted mother who home schools all their children. Brad is a hard worker and a dedicated employee for Symons Fire Protection in the San Diego suburb of Poway.We ask for your prayers and assistance in supporting this young and precious Godly family as they attempt to physically and emotionally recover from this unimaginable tragedy.This GoFundMe Campaign will help the Sparks with the impossible financial fallout of this fatal car accident.

Initially, we were all hopeful he would make a full recovery, but unfortunately, his condition worsened with each passing day. On 3/2/21, our worst fears came true. His breathing had gotten to the point where he needed a ventilator to help him breathe. We were by his side before they transferred him to the ICU. We video called his parents and he was able to hear their best wishes, acknowledge them, and waved. We, by his side, said “Hey dad, see you later when you wake up. Let your body rest and recover.” We never fathomed that that would be our last moments.He was always the most friendly and supportive person. He always went out of his way for friends, neighbors, and especially, family. He never expected anything in return. Anyone who knew him probably also remembers his welcoming presence and his bright smile. He loved camping. He loved his lamps. He loved his aquarium. But most of all, he loved his family. All his hobbies, dreams, interests, came last. He placed himself at the bottom so his family can be on top. He was our rock and foundation. I wish I could have spent just a little more time with him, doing the things he liked, taking more interest in his hobbies, or even just had a few more conversations...There was so, so much left to do. We never imagined life without you nor how short our time would be. We never knew how much of the storm you’ve weathered for us and everything you’ve shielded us from.

Many of you have been wondering why Rick Simpson hasn’t been present in the public arena for the past few years. We have decided to inform the public that, in May 2018, Rick suffered a stroke and has since been in the process of recovery.Being a very private person, neither Rick nor his family wanted to make this information public earlier so that he could be fully focused on his recovery.It is needless to say that a stroke and its aftermath often prove to be an extreme challenge for the person who suffered from it as well as their immediate family. Since Rick’s stroke, his sole caregiver was and still is his wife Danijela, with whom he had for the last seven years been diligently working on educating people about the benefits of medicinal cannabis through lectures, interviews and consultations worldwide, while holding a base in Europe.Rick has come a long way in the last two and a half years but despite all human efforts to meet and keep up with all of Rick's medical needs, Rick and Danijela are now facing immense financial challenges.Therefore, we are organising a fundraising campaign to help cover Rick’s medical expenses, those incurred during the last two and a half years and those which are still on the horizon.After years of advocating for people’s rights to heal themselves using natural remedies, more specifically cannabis oil today widely known as RSO – Rick Simpson Oil, which a great number of people around the world are using to either cure or help regulate many different health conditions, and after writing two books on the subject, giving countless interviews and lectures, Rick is now in need of some kindness from all of you who are willing and able to help.How can you help?You can support Rick Simpson by buying one of his books or by making a donation!Buy one of Rick’s books at: www.simpsonramadur.com/webshop Make a donation in support of Rick Simpson here.A wholehearted thank you!Rick and Danijela SimpsonRead more"

Our family currently resides out of state in Hawaii and Colorado, where Demery also calls home.Unfortunately Demery tested positive for COVID-19 when admitted to the hospital and is currently in the COVID isolation unit. This means our family has been unable to see her in the hospital. We are having the opportunity to see her via zoom sessions set up at her bedside.

We are currently renting an apartment near the hospital and are anxiously awaiting our opportunity to begin seeing her in the hospital. Any donations regardless the size are graciously welcomed and we cannot thank you enough for your support. If you find yourself unable to contribute financially, holding space for Demery in your thoughts and in your heart is very much appreciated. We know she can feel the love!

It’s not very easy for anyone to endure such a loss, we hurt for our mother, and father who should never see their first daughter suffer the way she did. Illness during a pandemic has by far been the most difficult unprecedented scenarios to deal with, in retrospect to the separation that it causes. Hospitals simply prohibits visitors and family members. One of the most important things that we were stripped away from was physically being able to be there with her. To hold her, to talk to her, to let her know that we love her.  Karen had contracted Covid-19 some time in the beginning of the pandemic back in March of 2020. Although mild symptoms, she overcame her situation and life continued. Fast forward to early December 2020, Karen was admitted into Cedar-Sinai on worries of her failing kidneys. For about two weeks her high blood pressure was monitored along with her blood work. Karen spent her 25th birthday in a hospital bed on December 15th. With her underlying conditions, Karen strived to make diet changes and a healthier living to accommodate her situation. She was doing absolutely stellar, losing weight and focusing on a no sodium diet. We spent a beautiful Christmas with our immediate family and her new perspective of life. She glowed in beauty and was the family mediator and kept things at home aligned. We are not a family that comes from money, and we don’t pretend to be. We are simply a family who came from nothing, both parent immigrants in the pursuit of happiness. She was a provider and invested in everything that assured a better life for us all. She is my biggest inspiration.  It wouldn’t be until mid-January that our mother and her would contract the illness. Bed rested for weeks and experiencing all the symptoms they both suffered together. As a family we made sure to safely accommodate their needs in any way possible. Our mother had thankfully fully recovered, but Karen’s condition worsened. An exclamation of chest pains and shortness of breath was alerting.  My sister Lauren had brought her to Lakewood Regional center on January 29th, 2021, where unknowingly she would live out the remainder of her life. For about two weeks we tried to keep in contact with her, keeping her spirits up. She was eager to come home angrily stating that we clean the entire house and bath our dog and cat. She said “I’m not fucking going through this shit again!” Without hesitation we did, we made sure it was perfect for her. Days have passed and she kept us informed on her condition, she went into respiratory distressed on Saturday February 6th, then and there she had to be on a BiPAP. The next day February 7th, I received a phone call that they would intubate her. This would be the last line of defense in hopes of recovery. At 6:57 PM I had received a missed call and voice message in hopes of good news. Unaware and in the care of my son, my heart sank, my words stumbling, my soul lifeless. Karen had passed away at 6:44 PM. I was so angry at the informality of the news, the unsympathetic tone in the nurse’s voice. My baby sister just passed and you leave a voicemail. He left a reminder of pain and an everlasting bearing of bad news.  What breaks my heart the most is that we fear that the funeral must be fairly small and intimate. It pains me that some very close friends may not be able to see her before her cremation. With the Covid guidelines and regulations, there's just not enough space to accommodate everyone. Along with many other families that are enduring a loss, we are unable to fully settle into a funeral home. We are hearing that if we’re unlucky we would not be able to have these services until March or April. We are still tirelessly in the works to contacting affordable places that can host her.  So today, as I write this and if you’ve read this far into my endeavoring words, we ask that if you have any loose change to donate, this will lift a huge financial burden. Our mother is no longer working and our father works in an unorthodox work place that does not provide time-off pay. The money will strictly go into funeral accommodations, fees, and any remaining medical bills that could not be covered.  We will also be hosting a very limited spaced candle light ceremony at our home this upcoming Saturday February 13th. We please ask that close friends try to not bring a plus one for our home is small and we can only allow so many people. Feel free to text Lauren for more information, or if anyone wants to talk please do not hesitate to call or text me.  Thank you, friends and families, for the light you have shined on Karen’s life. Let’s endure this together, because she wouldn’t want to see us in mourning, but yearning for a celebration of her life.   Sincerely,                                                Norman LonhRead more"

We are worried that if the property is sold, that the newowners may not be cat friendly and may not want The Kats around anymore! The property being sold is a diamond in the rough! The location is quiet, private and hidden from the open public eye. The property includes a home, 4 garages (with electric and water) and land. If this crazy dream/idea could become a reality, this would not only save The Kats home, it would also save and change COUNTLESS lives for years to come! We already have so many ideas for the buildings! A recovery area for cats recovering from TNR surgery or medical conditions before being released back to their location! An intake area for cats/kittens that are awaiting foster or rescue placement! A heated/AC place indoors for The Kats to enjoy! A storage area for us to store cat food ,supplies and traps. And we would even like to start up a community pet food pantry! The ideas are endless! Plus, The Kats can continue to roam the place with no worries! This would be turned in to an oasis PURRADISE for them! A sanctuary for our original Kolony Kats like no other! But, time IS NOT on our side. The owner wants to sell ASAP.This is where you come in! We cannot do this without your help! If you LOVE cats, support TNR, advocate for ferals and believe in us, PLEASE consider helping us make this dream come true for The Kats!

Raul Ramirez has always lived in a giving state of mind, putting his life on the line during his Marine Corp Service and his subsequent career as a Police Officer. Although he served two tours of duty in Fallujah where he was exposed to many life threatening situations, he did not allow that to stop him from serving his community as a patrol officer for the Los Angeles Police department. For the past 4.5 years, he has been a valued officer within his department. He has worked in community patrol, making connections and significant differences in the lives of many and modeling compassionate behavior for his young son .On February 27,2021 he and his family were in a tragic vehicle accident. Officer Raul Ramirez was air lifted to local hospital and with support and many prayers Raul survived however his arm was amputated at the shoulder.The journey to recovery is a VERY strenuous, yet tangible road. Raul will need many therapy sessions, mental and physical support, and he will need a prosthetic Arm to help him get back to his daily life.Raul has spent his career serving others not only as Marine and Police officer but as a wonderful caring human being.Anything helps and is appreciated. Most prosthesis contractors accept insurance for partial payments, the rest must be paid in cash or verified funds. This GoFund me page is made to help offset any cost that officer Raul will have for a prosthetic arm and hopefully alleviate any stress him and his family have been going through.I will try and keep everyone updated here as often as things change. Please leave uplifting comments here and lots of prayers. We thank you; fellow Marines, Veterans, First Responders, Family, Friends, and those unknown to us,for your prayers and support. -Semper Fi-

We are hoping to get a strong boost at the beginning of his possible recovery to keep his mental and physical gain up. Thank you - the story is below.This fundraiser is being set up by Gaylon's long time friend Sam V. Gaylon is in need of support from his snowboarding buddies, fellow Eagle Scouts, the Boy Scout and soccer communities he spent the majority of his time growing up with and all his friends.Gaylon was the victim of a home invasion robbery while visiting friends in Portland, OR, on January 27, he was shot and suffered a spinal cord injury leaving him paralyzed from the waist down and has lost the use of his right arm and hand. The one shot went through his arm, two ribs, his lungs and shattered the T9 vertebrae before passing through his torso where it stopped. The one friend that was at the house that night saved Gaylon's life by knowing the first aid to perform, when the EMS arrived they worked diligently to stabilize him and get him to the hospital. Gaylon underwent emergency surgery.  The impact on the T9 caused damage to the nerves in his spinal cord and the bullet going through his bicep tore nerves causing the loss of use to his lower arm and hand. Gaylon remains in the hospital at this time and will be in Portland for the next couple of months.I am asking for your financial assistance to support Gaylon's current and future needs for recovery. With your donations, we can help get him to the best doctors to do everything possible to help in his recovery. While his long term prognosis is unknown at this time, he is a fighter and won't give up hope.Paralyzed for the unseen future, Gaylon has a lot of physical therapy and rehabilitation to go through. He has no source of income now and does not want to put the full force on his parents. As friends let’s do what we can. Gaylon, his family, and his friends are very appreciative of anything. His family lives in Louisiana and he lives in Arizona. Upon his return to his home, he will need to make accommodations to his house to adjust to his new living style.Gaylon’s message -




“My name is Gaylon and I’m not one to ask for much help ever, ask anyone who knows me. But just recently I was involved in a terrible attack, I was the victim of a home invasion robbery and I was shot once and it has left me hospitalized and paralyzed for the time being. I never thought I would be in a position like this, I had no way to prepare and now I need the help I never ask for.I have such a long road ahead me and that means money will be tight for me and my family. Medical bills and the bills I currently have. Listen anything you choose to donate could really help me out. I know times have been hard during 2020, but I never thought this would happen to me and I will be forever grateful for even just a dollar donation. My friend Sam and my family have set up this go fund me page for me in hopes that it would be one less thing for me to stress about while I’m on the road to recovery. We will post updates on this gofundme page and on Facebook to let you all know how I'm doing on my road to recovery!







Thank you to whoever sees this, shares this or donates. Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I’m a fighter and a survivor.”Message 3184640576 for any questions.

On Monday March 8th, Kurtis was working with his athletes on a Zoom call while home alone. He suddenly felt severe chest pains and was rushed to the hospital where they found that he had an Aortic Aneurysm (a tear in his Aorta). He immediately underwent a 7 hour emergency open heart surgery where they replaced 3"" of his Aorta with a graft, as well as had a mechanical valve put in.He was closely monitored over night and throughout the next day, when he was brought in for a follow-up surgery on Tuesday evening.There has been several updates since Tuesday, but the most up to date one came this morning that Kurtis was extubated and breathing on his own, and was communicating and talking.Kurtis's group of friends discussed ways of helping Kurt and the family, and it was brought up to start a Go Fund Me page. We discussed it with the family to ensure they were comfortable with it, and they expressed that they were, but wanted to ensure that no one felt obligated to donate.During Covid times, it is especially difficult to show support to families when you cannot just pop in for a visit or drop off a basket or a hot meal. This is an avenue that some feel they can help, and with the road to recovery being of an unknown duration, we want to help support any needs that may arise for them. Even if it is just to purchase 100 more health and training/development books for Kurtis to even further master his craft, anything will go a long way.Any support is greatly appreciated, whether a donation or a warm message to the family.Thank you all for everything!

Hi there!

Recently, whilst travelling and also performing throughout the cities and towns of Spain , our very close friend ended up doing himself quite the mischief, and unfortunately shattered both of his ankles through a freak accident whilst on his journey, rendering him unable to walk for the next three months.Due to the current political climate (BREXIT), he is unable to stay in Spanish hospitals to fully recover and has until Monday to work out where he will : stay, financially support himself and a place to receive medical treatment. The only other option he has been offered, would be for him to stay in a homeless shelter preventing him from being able to work.So we are here to raise money to get our very good friend back home and make a swift recovery. The money donated will go to getting Gareth a wheelchair and making sure he can get home in the fastest and safest way possible. We understand that we are in the middle of the pandemic and this makes it worse for our friend who is trapped out there by himself and will not, by Monday, have a hospital bed to fully recover in.Most of us know Gareth by performing from London to the whole south coast. The man has a heart of gold and only wants the best for everyone else. So now it's our time to return the favour and...BRING GARETH HOME!

He was struggling to swallow and acting like something had been caught in his throat. Once we arrived at the hospital they immediately sedated him and took him for emergency x-rays. They discovered that Odie had ingested a foreign object which was lodged in his stomach. This caused him to have a condition known as bloat. The doctor tried to induce vomiting with medication to no avail. Our options were to risk his life hoping it would pass or have emergency surgery to remove the blockage. We opted for the surgery to save Odie. The doctor informed us that the bill will be between $4,000-$6000 for his surgery and the hospital stay. We would first like to ask all of you for your prayers so Odie may make a full recovery. Second, any donations that you can make to help us to pay for his life saving surgery would be very much appreciated. Many of you know that our Odie and Alphie are Brandon and I's babies. Odie is our cuddly, kissy, mommas boy. Odie will be our ring bearer at our upcoming wedding in September. He is the love of our life along with Alphie. Our Odie is strong and we are praying for his full recovery.

Kelli Bolt- Welch, of Atlanta, Texas, a 35 y/o single mom and Registered Nurse, currently employed at Collom & Carney Urology Clinic in Texarkana, Texas suffered life altering injuries as the result of gunshot wounds to her right upper arm & right lower leg!! During the early morning hours of Saturday, August 15,2020 Kelli was shot with a .357 at her residence in Atlanta, Texas. She was taken by ambulance to Christus St Michael Hospital in Atlanta, Texas and then airlifted to Christus St Michael Hospital in Texarkana, Texas where she underwent a 4 hour surgery with a team of 3 doctors to repair her injuries. The first bullet went through her right upper arm shattering the bones and severing the artery - this bullet then entered her right breast and lodged in the muscle tissue. The second bullet hit her in the lower right leg breaking the fibula. A vascular surgeon had to remove a portion of artery from her left thigh and graft it on her upper right arm to replace that severed artery. The orthopedic surgeon cleaned and closed the leg wound & attached an external fixator on the upper arm! A general surgeon went in and removed the bullet from the right breast. At this time they are waiting on a consult with an orthopedic trauma surgeon to assess and prepare for additional surgical procedures to repair the damage to the arm! She is facing multiple surgeries in the very near future to repair the arm as well as extensive physical therapy. Prognosis for usage of the arm and leg are unknown at this time. She sustained nerve damage to both the arm and the leg! We have no time frame for recovery. Kelli will be unable to work for the foreseeable future. Kelli is a strong fighter but the road to recovery for her is going to be long and difficult!! Kelli is the mother of a 12 year old son, Maddox, that is her world! She is the daughter of T.J. Bolt and Cindi Richards-Young both of Atlanta, Texas. Any donations no matter how small or large will be appreciated and will help tremendously! If you can’t donate please continue to lift Kelli in prayer!

Hello everyone and thank you for interest in my story. On March 10 2021 at 4:15am My family went through terrible wake up after loud noise from the garage. After quick run I found out the source of the noise and located fire in the garage what is attached to the house , the only thing what went through my mind is to save my family. Thank god me , my wife and my two 6 yr old girls got out in time. Standing outside and watching your house being destroyed is feeling I don’t wish on anyone. The inside of the garage with 2 cars inside burned to shell. The firefighters quick action saved half of the house from the fire , but the smoke and waterthat put the fire down destroyed the other half with everything inside.

And on this day we start from the beginning , no clothes , no house , no cars. Because of it with all my heart i ask anyone for any kind of help.Meand my familyThank you very much and we wish you everything the best.

My dog Sasha ran off from my pet sitter family at Lee's cabin and went missing. She was missing for six days through the snow storm without a sign. She was found in a wolf trap and was very lucky to survive. What you can do to help:She has extensive damage to two paws and needs surgery to amputate and remove dead tissue from them. I will be needing to pay for her surgery and rehab fees and I did not anticipate in my wildest dreams that this awful situation would happen to her and cannot afford her surgery. I appreciate all the help I can get for this long journey that she and I have ahead. She is going to have a very hard time walking after her amputations, and I am saving up to get her prosthetic limbs so she may be able to walk again. Our story: I feel heartbroken, because I rescued her 5 years ago around Christmas time after her owner gave her up during hard times, and I promised her the best I could possibly do for her for the rest of her life, and I feel like I failed. She has participated in nearly every ASPA skijoring race since I rescued her, and has taught many other dogs and people how to skijor, a sport that encourages recreation and the companionship between dogs and people in a magical way. She is known for her big heart and ears and the loving way she is with everyone she meets. I wish more than anything in the world that she will be okay, and will be comfortable for her remaining years. We plan to do public outreach to educate others about the dangers of dogs and traps as well as outreach to other prosthetic patients dogs and people alike.

Two days after that he was rushed into life-saving cranial surgery to relieve pressure on his brain, ending up on life support in the ICU.Without warning or any known underlying causes, Malcolm had had a devastating stroke, suddenly collapsing while visiting his climbing partner and close friend Simon Yearsley. Fortunately, Simon and his wife, Sarah, were able to identify the signs of a stroke and called an ambulance - their quick thinking almost certainly saved Malcolm’s life. The stroke hit without mercy and flung this immensely fit athlete, adventurer and National Health Service psychologist into the abyss.As soon as Malcolm’s wife, Donna James, received the shocking and terrifying news she sped from their home in the north of England to be with him, unsure if he was going to survive. Malcolm spent many harrowing months in hospital and since the craniectomy surgery he’s been wearing a special helmet until he has another operation to repair his skull with a protective plate.The catastrophe has turned Malcolm and Donna’s world upside down.Malcolm was recently able to return home to continue his gruelling rehabilitation. Even as someone who’s pushed himself to the limits of his courage and endurance on technically hard, new routes on high altitude peaks, he’s now facing the toughest challenge of his life.We, a group of his oldest and closest friends, want to get him back out into the mountains as soon as possible. But you have to walk before you can run, let alone climb, so we’re raising funds to provide our incredible mountain athlete with the care, equipment and treatment he needs for the mission of getting back on his feet - literally - and ultimately back out into a world of adventure in whatever form that’s feasible.We’re reaching out now because time is of the essence in this crucial phase of his recuperation. The more and the sooner Malcolm can have extra physical, occupational and cognitive therapy the better chance he has of the fullest recovery possible. He’s making gradual progress but there is still a long way to go.HOW YOU CAN HELPMalcolm is a person of courage, vision, wisdom and compassion. He’s also a ridiculously modest, kind, generous and hilarious bloke, and a great cook. He is a wonderful husband, son, brother, uncle, colleague, neighbour and friend. He has always been a rock of support and loving advice for family, friends and colleagues - for anyone who’s ever needed him.It’s now our job to be there for this extraordinary man when he and Donna need us most.Donna is no stranger to challenges either, as a duathlon champion, triathlete and triathlon coach, and she’s taking care of her husband at home, working tirelessly to help him with his therapy to improve his motor skills , and surrounding Malcolm with the love and support that’s crucial to his recovery. But she can’t do it alone and, on top of that, the pandemic has made it impossible for family and friends to visit and help out.WHAT MALCOLM NEEDSBy mid-February, six months after his stroke, Malcolm has to be pushed along in a wheelchair but is learning to stand up and walk with assistance, a few steps at a time. His left side is still grievously affected, as is his eyesight, and while his cognition is good and speech improving, Malcolm is racing against time to make more progress.We aim to raise funds to help provide Malcolm immediately, and in the longer term, with vital (but expensive) assistance, including:-As much top class physical and occupational therapy as possible to try to restore movement to Malcolm’s affected left side, in hopes he can move independently again and be able to do things such as shower and dress without assistance. He dreams of being able to cook Donna one of his superb Indian dinners again.-Home care helpers for some of the basic needs of his day.-Other forms of therapy to improve his speech and cognition, maximise impaired vision and aid his psychological well-being.-Equipment such as an off-road wheelchair and a specialist tricycle to allow Malcolm not only to get around with greater ease but to explore again some wild outdoor spaces that are so central to his life and spirit.-A variety of home alterations that range from some basic improvements now for easier wheelchair use, right up to adapting Donna and Malcolm’s barn into a rudimentary rehab gym, and other important items, such as an adapted vehicle.Some of these facilities are needed as soon as possible - stroke patients make their biggest improvements in the first year, so we’re up against the clock.Other needs will emerge over the coming months as it becomes clear how fast and how far Malcolm can progress.We are determined that this will not be the end of Malcolm’s sporting endeavours, independence and irrepressible vitality. He is filled with hope and spirit, committed to battling onwards and upwards in a bid not only to restore as much of his function as possible but also to do what he can in the longer run to help others who find themselves in a similar predicament.We all want to do everything we can to get him back to doing the things that are so close to his heart. Will you help us #MoveMountainsForMalcolm?MORE ABOUT MALCOLMWhen Malcolm, at only 55, suffered the stroke he had many ambitious climbing projects in the pipeline, including leading new Scottish winter routes and Himalayan expeditions. Sadly these will remain unfulfilled, but we aspire to get him back out into the mountains that inspire him.He’s spent many years pursuing his passions, achieving world class climbs in the mountains of Europe, China, India, Pakistan, the US and UK, and rock-climbing in his beloved North Yorkshire.One highlight happened in 2018 when Malcolm led the first ascent of Janhukot, a goal he’d pursued for many years, and, with teammates Guy Buckingham and Paul Figg, stood exhilarated atop the spectacular peak in the Indian Himalaya (6,780m/22,244 feet).He’s made so many good friends along the way and is universally known as a mountaineer quick to share his knowledge and ideas in ways that inspire and coach others and have helped advance the sport as a whole, not with ego but joy and a huge heart.Malcolm’s talent and dedication, including serving for two years as vice-president of The Alpine Club, have done much to boost British climbing.In earlier years in the wild outdoors he made his mark as an exploratory caver and cave-diver pushing the limits in many previously-uncharted subterranean systems, before he fell in love with mountaineering - all crammed into his spare time outside of a high-pressure job.Malcolm trained as a psychologist after graduating from Leeds University and has spent his whole career working for the NHS, helping patients at their most vulnerable.In recent times, Malcolm began writing a book about the psychological aspects of high altitude mountaineering, and the good news is he’s still working on that during his rehabilitation.He’s also now charting his recovery efforts and is collaborating with a research project and charity in hopes of helping other stroke victims and injured athletes through the development of new equipment.We’ll have more details on this and other news in future updates.Meanwhile, please join us and be part of our effort to #MoveMountainsForMalcolm.Read more"

He was ejected from the vehicle and found lying underneath the car. He was rushed to Mercy Hospital in Springfield, Mo where he suffered cardiac arrest twice. He sustained severe injuries including a shattered pelvic and fractures in his neck and back. Levi lost a lot of blood due to internal bleeding, requiring multiple units of blood. Due to the internal bleeding, his left kidney is no longer able to function and his right kidney is damaged requiring dialysis. His pelvic will require complete reconstruction but he has not yet been able to have this surgery because his vitals have not been stable enough. On Tuesday night the 9th, his oxygen level dropped so low that his organs would have begun to shut down. The only option at this time was for Levi to receive the very risky and dangerous ECMO surgery. This machine/procedure works as his heart and lungs in order to give his organs time to rest and repair. The minimimum amount of days on this machine is 5 and could potentially go up to 30 days. During this surgery Levi went into cardiac arrest again for 7 whole minutes. The doctors were able to resuscitate him. Miraculously he did not sustain any brain damage! As of Thursday March 11th, his vitals are in a better place. His lungs are in critical shape and this is an area that we need to see improvement! Once his lungs become clear and vitals remain stable, the next step is for the doctors to take him into surgery and repair his pelvic. Depending on the severity of his pelvic, he will not be able to bear any weight on it for 3 to 12 months. This will require a stay at a rehabilitation facility. Levi is currently on dialysis and we are hopeful this is a temporary situation but there is potential that this will be a lifelong treatment. With having a critically ill loved one, expenses start incurring immediately.Levi is an amazing father to a 4 year old little boy named Lincoln. Due to the circumstances, Levi will not be able to help care or provide for Lincoln. Living expenses, daycare, child support, all will not be possible and we know Levi wants Lincoln to be provided for. Lincoln is Levi's whole world, his best friend!Another way everyone can help is to pray for complete healing for Levi! Prayers to help Lincoln understand and cope with his father's injuries and recovery. The impact this will have on a 4 year old is devestating. We appreciate you all and love you all.

After a misdiagnosis (which we cannot go into detail about), these symptoms have significantly worsened over the past year. About two weeks ago, to be exact, she started to lose her vision completely.She scheduled an Ophthalmology appointment immediately, as she always would when something just didn't seem right. Working as a medical professional, health issues is something my Sister never overlooked.At her appointment, it was discovered that her pupil was not reacting the way it should normally. The doctor immediately ordered an MRI. This is the moment my Sisters comfort zone was tested to the upmost challenge so far in her life.Result: Brain Tumor...Absolutely, positively, the worst news you could hear sitting in the doctors office all by yourself.She has an amazing support system of Family, Friends and even Strangers right now.We contemplated starting a Gofundme because we didn't want to place a burden on anyone else, but getting the actual diagnosis today put many things into perspective.Working in a clinic setting, she can potentially be exposed to COVID-19 and can no longer work for that reason. The surgeon at the Mayo Clinic was phenomenal! The entire staff/team and experience was top-notch. Today he stated that there are two ways to remove the tumor, either through the nose or the skull. Because of this size and possibility of it being more solid he is a little reluctant to use the nasal approach. Regardless, it will be removed and we will be on the road to recovery!My Sister has always put others before herself and it pains me to see her have any worries about anything financial when she should just be focusing on her health for herself and son.Please consider donating any amount...even small, because it will all add up in the end to help her pay her bills and lodging while making trips to Rochester.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!We will get through this!The photo above is the photo that we looked over today, in detail with the surgeon.

The 2.5 hour surgery took 7 hours instead. After a week in the hospital recovering, Tiffany was released and a few days later moved into her college dorm at Rosemont College-something she had been looking forward to for many months. 10 days later, Tiff spiked a fever and her health quickly deteriorated. She went from her local ER, to Cooper University Hospital and was choppered down to the University of Maryland Medical Center where her procedure was performed. Tiffany had an ulcer, an abscess, was septic and had internal bleeding from an unknown origin. Tiffany underwent numerous procedures to try to stop the bleeding. She's been on a ventilator and received countless blood transfusions.On Thursday, September 7, Tiffany took a turn for the worse, when a hole was found in her stomach the size of a pencil point and she was taken back to the OR. After this procedure, the prognosis was dire and Tiff's family was preparing for the worst. Thanks to the excellent care of the medical staff at U of Md, and the prayers from Tiff's family and friends, a miracle happened and Tiffany is slowly improving. She's endured another week of tests and procedures and is making progress every day. ""Slow and steady wins the race."" But she has a long road ahead of her for a full recovery and the medical bills and travel expenses are mounting. Cheryl has not left her side, and Tom and Joe are traveling back and forth to Maryland to be with them. We are looking to raise money to help the family with medical bills, travel expenses, future care and to help pay the bills while her family is not working so they can be by Tiff's side.

In summer 2019 the future looked bright for Joel and his family. Having received fantastic A-level results he was looking forward to going to university in September. Less than two weeks later on August 28 following a period of having severe migraine type headaches he went to the optician on the advice of his GP. The Optician saw retinal haemorrhaging and sent him immediately to hospital. Within a few days he was having emergency brain surgery to remove a golf ball sized brain tumour. Although the tumour was removed successfully, a few days into Joel’s recovery they received the devastating diagnosis of glioblastoma - the most lethal and aggressive brain cancer. Average life expectancy is only 18 months, and it is incredibly rare that anyone lives longer than five years. Since September 2019 Joel has received excellent care from the NHS at The Christie Hospital having radiotherapy, chemotherapy and a clinical trial of immunotherapy.Joel has bravely endured all the treatments but worries that any headache is the first sign that the cancer is returning. COVID-19 has made it even more difficult to enjoy the time that he has to spend with his friends and family and he’s not been able to do things that he loves like meeting friends, acting and clubbing. He is determined to live a normal life for as long as he possibly can and after having had to postpone his first year of university following his diagnosis he began University in September 2020.The best possible treatment, in addition to the NHS standard care he has had, is Dendritic Cell Vaccine which is essentially a personalised cancer killing vaccine made from Joel’s own residual tumour tissue. Given that Joel’s treatment to this date has only been palliative this is the most promising way of actually prolonging his life. The treatment is not yet available on the NHS even though it is recommended by renowned oncologists. Because this treatment is bespoke for Joel we will need to raise over £400,000 for the vaccine to be manufactured by a biotech company in Cambridge and for him to receive the treatment from a leading brain tumour Professor from Kings College Hospital in London. Your donation towards this pioneering treatment will help Joel and also contribute to developing breakthrough cancer treatment for brain tumours to help others in the future.

Hello Friends, Family, & Strangers - Thank you for taking the time to read and donate to Lauren’s battle against breast cancer.Anyone who knows my sister knows that she is a very private person. Earlier this year, when she was first diagnosed with an irregular mass in her breast, she assured me that it would be nothing to worry about.We quickly realized it was more urgent than we originally thought when Lauren felt another mass almost a month later, under her armpit. With how quickly it had spread and with our family history of cancer, the doctors prioritized her case and she was officially diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer at 29 years old.Since then, she has had a double mastectomy and is currently on her 6th round of chemo, with 10 more rounds to go. She is currently being treated for Stage 3, moving forward with optimism and has been a pillar of strength for her daughter.In these short few months, my sister has had to deal with not only the physical, mental, and emotional toll of her whole world changing, but also as a working mother with a young daughter and thousands of dollars of medical bills and mounting debt. Herdaily life now seems to revolve around doctor visits, surgeries and chemotherapy.Since childhood, my big sister has been a protector and fighter in the truest sense. She’s resilient, quick-witted, strategic, passionate, strong, and brave. Never scared to back down from anyone or anything; she raised my brother and I with a maternal ferocity and love that has followed us through our entire lives, always putting us first and doing anything she can to make sure that we are happy and safe. As most siblings can tell you - we keep our circle small, we rely on each other to get us through our hardest moments. In recent years our circle has become even smaller... My sister and I do what we can for each other when we can - even when we don’t have any to give, we find more ways to reach as far as we can for each other.Financially, we have stretched as far as we can and unfortunately the expenses of this illness are continuously mounting. Which is why we have turned to the vast network of friends, family, and kind strangers who may empathize for our situation.Due to the lack of family and financial support, my sister is still working to pay for bills and childcare. Any help towards lifting this financial burden, would both significantly reduce her stress levels and increase her chances of a full recovery.On behalf of my sister, her daughter, and our family and loved ones - Thank you. Thank you for caring, thank you for donating, and thank you for sharing our cause.Ally________________________________________________________This letter was written by Lauren's sister, Ally. Recently, however, Lauren has lost her sister too. Because of this, some of us have taken over to help Lauren, but there's not much else we can say that Ally hasn't already said better. Since Ally's passing, Lauren is preparing for another funeral as her mother is in hospice, and the doctor has given her mother 2 weeks to 2 months at most. Since the letter, Lauren has just finished her last round of chemo, and will start radiation shortly. The money would be a huge relief.Breakdown of Costs:$18,672 - Past medical bills$6000 ~ Estimated costs for medical bills for the rest of the year$6,000 ~ Estimated funeral costsLauren is a very strong person, and she's coping with everything thrown at her better than anyone else we know possibly could, but the financial strain from her medical bills is an unnecessary burden and it's one of the few we, as friends can try and help with.

Testing revealed that cancer to be stage 4 Neuroblastoma. Only weeks after his life altering diagnosis we welcomed our third child. The last 6 weeks have been a whirlwind of biopsies, chemo, general anaesthetics, hospital stays, sleepless nights and an incredible amount of stress, shock and worry. It is an overwhelming journey we are on and there are so many uncertainties - unfortunately it is also a huge financial burden that will take its toll on our family. Your support means everything to us and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your generosity; your help will allow Oli to get the lifesaving treatment he needs whilst also providing practical support to us such as childcare.FOLLOW OLI'S JOURNEY : https://www.facebook.com/groups/265618517802479/Read on for more detail about Oli’s cancer, the treatment plan, our family and what this devastating news has meant for us all.We want to begin by introducing you to Manoli (Oli). Oli is a 3-year-old who lives in Melbourne, Australia. Oli has the sweetest demeanour and has a special place in so many people’s hearts. He was born just two weeks before his grandfather passed away at only 61 after battling his own cancer - Multiple Myeloma. He was named after his grandfather. This was one of the hardest periods of our family’s lives, during this time he brought an abundance of light and comfort for us all during those dark days of grief.Oli has an older sister Alesia (5 yo) and welcomed his younger sister Thalia in October 2020. He has a very special bond with them both. He has so much love to give. Oli loves tram and train rides, playing with play dough and drawing, and spending time with his family and friends.On 11 September 2020 our world fell apart. At 3:10pm Joel (Oli’s dad) got the dreaded call from the senior doctors at the Royal Children’s Hospital requesting to meet regarding one of Oli’s test results.Prior to this call, in late August, Oli had begun limping and refusing to walk, and after various scans the Orthopaedic team determined he had a fractured femur bone and an infection in the hip joint area. He was diagnosed with Osteomyelitis and was placed in a hip spica brace for 4 weeks. The infection did not get better with the antibiotics and surgery, so the surgical team suggested that Oli have a bone marrow biopsy, thinking that he picked up a bad bug.Joel was in the hospital with Oli at the time, and Leni (Oli’s mum) was at home about to visit her GP because she was 35 weeks pregnant and experiencing bad cramps. Joel realised he was about to get bad news as he could see the doctors congregating at the door.They walked in and sat him down and asked him to call Leni. It was then that the family were told that the bone marrow biopsy showed something more sinister than an infection, and that he had Neuroblastoma. From that moment our lives were changed forever.Neuroblastoma is a very rare form of childhood cancer, and in Australia they pick up an average of 30-40 cases per year. It is a cancer typically found in children under five, and unfortunately there is a 50 percent survival rate. Oli was diagnosed with high risk (stage 4) neuroblastoma, as he has a 10 cm tumour above his left adrenal gland, which has metastasised to his right femur bone and marrow area as well as his abdominal lymph nodes. As of the beginning of November, he has gone through three cycles of chemotherapy, been in a hip spica brace and plaster cast for 11 weeks, had burns and pressure sores on his back and legs, had numerous biopsies, and been under general anaesthetic 10+ times. We are so grateful to the Royal Children’s Hospital and the amazing nurses, doctors and support staff for looking after boy and supporting our family through the past few months.The complex treatment plan at the RCH is as follows:-5 cycles of chemotherapy (given over 5 days every three weeks). Due to the nature of the chemotherapy and the reactions Oli has, it means he will spend a significant amount of time in hospital.-Surgery to remove the tumour in his adrenal gland.-High dose chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant, and he will need to be in hospital for 5 weeks during this time.-Radiation therapy.-Immunotherapy.The cancer has a 50% chance of relapse once a child goes into remission.We have set up this page to raise funds for the on-going support and treatment of Oli’s Neuroblastoma. As there are extremely limited maintenance options within Australia to prevent a relapse, there is also the possibility of Oli being included in a lifesaving trial vaccine in the USA. Many families from Australia have embarked on this journey once in remission and it is a pathway we want Oli to be a part of as losing him is simply not an option. These vaccine trials unfortunately come at a huge cost of around $300,000 plus associated travel expenses.All of the money raised from this page will go towards Oli's treatment and recovery, as well as practical support such as childcare and meals. Any money that is not used for this purpose will be donated to Neuroblastoma Australia and Rare Cancers Australia. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact [email redacted] and someone will get back to you as soon as possible.From the bottom of our hearts we thank you for your generosity and support.Read more"

( LEAH’S STORY ( EULOGY ) , PURPOSE OF THE GOFUNDME BELOW )LEAH’S STORYLeah’s adventure began when she was whisked away from a puppy mill back in the summer of 2006. A gift from our uncle a few days after my 12th birthday. She came to us at six months old. When my dad went to pick her up in North Carolina and bring her to Florida, when visiting his brother in NC, she had escaped her cage and comidically made them chase her around this giant plot. She was very shy and scared when she finally got home and hid behind our entertainment center for hours. All of us sat and waited for her to be comfortable enough and slowly but surely she came out to meet her family. She came out of her shell quickly after that. She was playful, mischievous, food driven and cuddly. One of her first moments home was pooping directly in my youngest sister Laura’s shoe. Leah chose me to be her partner to sleep with since day one, but while we were at school she would follow my mom around like a little shadow. Getting deli meat and hot dogs to her heart content. We didn’t realize how four years later when my mom passed how much she would do for five kids who were hurt and lost. Though she herself was definitely hurting, she made sure she was there for us when we felt like we had no one to talk to or anyone to listen because walking kids through the loss of a parent is something not everyone can help with. She was snuck into luxury hotels where she would bark and security would come and ask if we have a dog, my mom would reply, “ Uh—that was one of my daughters “ and she loved exploring and sniffing every place she went. Leah lived to smell the air of new places outside her home, eat anything on your plate, sleep on your laundry pile or your most softest blanket and make you smile with her silliness. She loved charge down long hallways and be unleashed to run all the way back home on a walk. She lived for all of us together giving her attention all at once. When she needed to go out she would have certain barks. When she wanted in or DEMANDED a treat she would do the same. Leah had a huge personality for a tiny spirit and loved all of us so much that in her final hours, every time she would crash and come back, all she wanted to do was be held by me and know I was there. Because we’ve always had each other through the hardest times. Even until the very end.



———-GOFUNDMELeah died from pnemonia complications. She had an infected tooth pulled Friday and two days later developed pnemonia from the surgery. She stopped breathing in my arms at home during recovery from surgery which had me digging In her throat and patting her side and giving her CPR where she was rushed to the ER at 4AM. Leah fought hard the whole time. The liquid in her body was too much and she couldn’t expel it. She stopped breathing the first time and I was called to come give her hope. I stayed by her side and even though she was in agony, she gave me her sweetest smile like she always did with her eyes of adoration. The next day (last night) she stopped breathing again and had to be intubated. She was breathing on her own so she was taken off ( before being placed in an oxygen box ) and during that time all she wanted was to be in my arms and know I’m here for her during these moments she didn’t understand. I held her for as long as they would let me. After that I stayed in the parking lot for three more hours to see if her breathing would get better or if anything would change. The vet knocked on my car door saying she was crashing again and that was it. I rushed inside where she had been intubated one more time and she was deteriorating quickly. Her heart was having issues starting back up but we looked at each other one last time before she passed on. She waited for me until the very end. Leah was just everything to me and I can’t thank her enough. I have been unemployed since May and have no work. Her vet bills total up to $4,000 and added cremation which I took from my savings and drained it completely dry. I was in the middle of moving from LA to ATL since I had gotten opportunities to work originally in June, but now later this year. If you have anything to give this holiday season, even a dollar. I would really appreciate it. Knowing I spent so much and she’s still not here is killing me. Words of encouragement are also accepted and appreciated.

I am gravely upset. My parents' store (City Fashions) was completely looted during the riots this weekend in Bronzeville, Chicago. They took everything. These stores that my parents have worked for decades to build were ransacked in a mere instant. My dad helplessly watched City Fashions being overrun and looted, and my uncle was assaulted by a huge crowd ransacking the store. Although they were able to arrive home safely, they are completely devastated.My first generation Korean parents worked blood, sweat and tears to establish a proud business of their own. They’ve never closed during the holidays and always believed that business would prosper, even through many trying times. My dad, who’s always been an optimist, told me today that he gives up. Seeing my parents defeated and in despair breaks my heart. While I truly empathize with people’s outrage in the unjust treatment of African Americans, how can these protests justify destruction of innocent people’s livelihood? My parents did not deserve this at all..Unlike chained businesses, our small business insurance does not cover stolen goods and damages caused by rioters/looters. These stolen goods are worth about 350K+ dollars of merchandise. As such, my parents essentially lost their business in its entirety.Update on Monday, May 1st:Thank you for your support, concerns, and prayers. Today, many community members in Bronzeville and volunteers from CCUC (Chinese Christian Union Church) from Chinatown helped us clean. BLESS YOUR SOULS. Although, I didn’t get to meet everyone that helped, I am genuinely grateful. Further, to the friends and acquaintances that reached out to help, my family and I send our gratitude to you as well.To say the least, today was pretty chaotic. Many have asked why we were still in the area where it's unsafe. Truth be told, as looting in neighboring stores was still occurring, we salvaged what little goods we had left in the store, and knowing that another looting will be occurring tonight, we desperately reinforced the store and moved the remaining goods to mitigate the inevitable.This is where my brother, cousins, Peter and I want to take action to help my parents build back, at least in part, their precious business. They’ve been diligent and independent their whole lives, providing good and honest services to the communities in the Southside of Chicago for thirty plus years. To re-establish that same spirit of honest work in the communities, we humbly ask you for your support, no matter how small, in rebuilding our family’s livelihood. Thank you, and God bless us all during these troubled times.My heart goes out to George Floyd, his family, and everyone seeking change for the better.Korean Translation:마음이 정말 아픕니다. 저희 부모님의 가게 (City Fashions)가 폭동으로 인해 약탈을 당해 모든 것을 잃었습니다. 부모님께서 수십년 동안 키워오신 사업이 한순간에 뒤집어 엎어진것입니다. 아버지는 가게가 약탈되는것을 지켜 볼 수 밖에 없으셨고 저희 삼촌은 약탈자들에게 폭행을 당하셨습니다. 더 큰 피해를 입지 않고 집에 돌아오셨지만 두분 다 아주 큰 충격을 받으셨습니다.이민 1세대인 저의 부모님은 오랫동안 피, 땀, 눈물로 고생하시며 자랑스럽게 사업을 일구셨습니다. 남들 쉬는 공휴일에도 쉬지 않고 일하시고 힘든 시기를 이겨내시면서 언제나 성실하게 일하셨습니다.항상 모든 것에 밝고 긍정적이신 저희 아버지도 오늘 저에게 다 포기하고 내려 놓고 싶다고 말씀하시는데... 이렇게 괴로워하고 힘들어하시는 저희 부모님을 보니 제 마음도 찢어지게 아픕니다.저 역시 미국 내 흑인들을 향한 인종차별이 너무 마음 아프고 그 인종차별에 맞서 항의하는것을 이해하지만, 시위로 인해 아무 잘못없는 저희 부모님같은 분들의 삶이 무너지는것도 진심으로 안타깝고 괴로운 일입니다.여러분의 도움, 관심, 그리고 기도에 정말 감사드립니다. 오늘 Bronzeville 주민분들과 차이나타운에 Chinese Christian Union Church 자원 봉사자분들의 도움으로 저희 가게를 청소할 수 있었습니다. 여러분 한 분 한 분 직접 만나 인사드리지 못했지만, 다시 한번 진심으로 감사드리며 축복합니다. 저희 가족에게 큰 도움을 주신 친구분들과 지인분들께도 정말 감사드립니다.오늘은 저와 제 가족에게 정말 정신 없는 하루였습니다. 많은 분들이 저희에게 왜 아직도 안전하지 않은 저희 가게에 남아 있냐고 물어보십니다. 가게가 있는 동네에 아직도 약탈이 계속되는 가운데 얼마 남지 않은 짐을 정리하였습니다. 오늘 밤에 있을 약탈을 대비해 가게의 벽을 고치고 남은 짐을 다른 곳으로 옮겼습니다.큰 체인 가게들과는 달리 폭동으로 인해 약탈된 가게 물건들과 피해는 비즈니스 보험으로는 보상이 되지 않습니다. 약탈당한 물건은 대략 $350,000이 됩니다. 제 부모님은 사업을 통째로 잃으신 것입니다.이 때문에 저는 제 동생, 사촌들, 그리고 Peter와 함께 제 부모님이 다시 가게를 시작하도록 도와드리고 있습니다. 저희 부모님은 항상 독립적인 성실한 삶을 살아오셨으며 삼 십년 넘게 시카고 남쪽 지역에서 정직한 사업을 해오셨습니다.저희 부모님의 사업을 다시 세우는데, 겸손한 마음으로 여러분의 도움을 청합니다. 여러분의 작은 기부 하나 하나가 저희 가족에게 정말 큰 힘이 됩니다. 다시 한번 감사드리고 이 힘든 시기를 지나는 모든 분들께 주님의 이름으로 축복합니다.Here are some photos of City Fashions at its PRIME:

﷽

 This is for the sad, yet beautiful, passing of my Grandfather due to the illness of COVID-19 – Ali H – 10/11/2020I appreciate your time reading this, and for those who will contribute towards this. Your contributions will help us recover as much of the Medical Expenses (the reasons for which will become obvious below) for the COVID-19 Bills used to try and save our Grandfather, and to setup a Sadaqah Jāriyah for him to continue gaining rewards in his grave.Please make Dua to Allah for forgiveness and mercy for him to Jannah and/or share this to others. Here is the beautiful, yet distressing story of his passing.After 26 days of being diagnosed with COVID-19, our grandfather sadly passed away on the evening of Tuesday 10 November 2020. This was not without a painful but strong battle with pneumonia (from COVID-19) for almost four weeks. No hospitals accepted him. And his family was forced to pay enormous fees to build his own ‘hospital’, all at home, as the picture shows.Our grandfather was diagnosed on the 16 October 2020, with coronavirus (COVID-19) in Algeria and shortly after, he developed pneumonia as a result. This created complicated matters for his recovery, as hospitals in the neighbourhood he was in were sadly not accepting any patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Stories flooded the news in the locality of patients waiting in emergency room chairs only to only pass away with no space or care available.This meant the only chance of survival could be at home, with the greatest efforts made to bring medical care to our grandfather.For 26 days, his only two daughters (along with close help from the rest of sons and family) tirelessly tried to bring the best care to him. One of his daughters was my mother, who was stuck in London (as Algerian airports have been closed due to the pandemic) relentlessly spent every single waking hour of every single day and many sleepless nights researching with us, her children. We contacted doctors, from local GPs, all the way to online specialists from all over the world to try to get the best possible advice, medication and care for her father. She lived the last 26 days of our Grandfather far away from him, yet so close.His second daughter (also his youngest child) was in Algeria with him by his arms along with her husband using the help from abroad to try defy all odds to build the hospital for him her city could not provide: bringing all the latest equipment, ventilation, medication, and in-home doctors to visit and look after him as the picture shows above.Despite all efforts, it was the time Allah had decreed to return the soul of his righteous servant. On the morning of Tuesday 10 November, my grandfather fell into a coma and so with their last plead, his family called 41 private hospitals around,and they all refused to take him in.The 42nd hospital asked to take his blood test to see if he had recovered from the primary COVID infection and so was not infectious, in order to permit his entry to their hospital. His youngest daughter left to deliver the blood test in person. On her way to deliver the blood test to the hospital, my grandfather sadly passed away.Upon hearing the news, she rushed back with her husband. Her husband rushed to perform CPR one more time, in which our grandfather miraculously revived. Almost as if he were revived for two reasons, the first in which he declared his Shahādah, and the second is as if he did not want to pass away without his youngest daughter who had been looking after him for the past 26 days not being present. His daughter had spent almost four weeks looking after him, for him to pass in her absence, and he could not have that. سُبْحَانَ ٱلله ! Shortly after, he took his last breath.إنا لله وانا اليه راجعونʾinnā li-llāhi wa-ʾinna ʾilayhi rājiʿūnOur grandfather was a kind, caring, and humble man. He always greeted everyone at home. He took the effort to get to know us, and ask about us. He would even ask how our cat was doing. He cared about those around him, and it showed in all his actions. We grew up with him at home, in London. He dropped us to school. He tried to do house chores, despite protests. He was a loving man, and loved by those around him.Our grandfather always helped people. He was someone who would never oppress or harm anyone. Even at his age (and before his illness he was full of vigour and good health) he would continue to do good. When he lived with us, he only taught us to do that which is good and pleasing to Allah.One thing always remembered about my grandfather, is his commitment to guarding his prayers. He would get ready to pray as soon as the Athan was called, not delaying by even a minute. He didn't care who was with him, he would get up and go perform wudhu. Let us all remember him by this and try to follow the example he set. It may have been the reason Allah brought him back to make the Shahādah his last words!The Prophet ﷺ said:“He whose last words are ‘there is no God but Allah,’ will enter Paradise.”_________________________________It is a difficult time for the family he has left behind. To help him in his grave, we’ve set up this page to help contribute towards the medical expenses his family faced to tirelessly save him when all hope was lost. Secondly, any extra funding will be used as a Sadaqah Jariyah in his name, so that he can continue to be rewarded in his grave. I understand that you might not be able to donate, considering the circumstances surrounding us in the middle of the pandemic, regardless I appreciate your time in listening to our story and in return, please share and make dua for our Grandfather.The Prophet ﷺ said:""When a person dies, his deeds come to an end, except for three: ongoing charity (Sadaqah Jariyah), knowledge that is benefited from, and a righteous child who prays for him.” (Sahih Muslim)At this time of difficulty there are three things that we ask of you to do, and ask Allah to reward you immensely for doing so:1. Make dua to Allah for forgiveness and mercy for him and to enter him into JannahThe Prophet ﷺ said:“A mans status will be raised in Paradise and he will ask, How did I get here? He will be told, By your sons duaas (prayers) for forgiveness for you.""2. Donate towards helping cover the medical bills incurred by his family, as well as to help build him a Sadaqah Jariyah so he is able to reap the rewards of this charity (on his behalf) until the day of JudgementThe Prophet ﷺ said:""My mother has passed away, and if she could have spoken, she would have given something in charity. Will she receive a reward if I give something on her behalf?"" He said, ""Yes.""3. If you can not do that, the least you can do is SHARE to anyone you know (family, friends and so on and so forth)The Prophet ﷺ said:“Whoever guides someone to goodness will have a reward like the one who did it.”_________________________________I ask Allah to accept any contribution we make towards this great action, whether it is directly or indirectly.I ask Allah to forgive his sins and enter him into the highest level of Paradise.“Indeed we belong to Allah and indeed to Him we will return.""

APOYO A NELSON MAGALLANES CON LOS GASTOS MÉDICOS Y DE MANUTENCIÓN (ver texto en español)Nelson Magallanes suffered from a severe stroke on the morning of February 27th. Although he is showing signs of improvement, it will take him months of rehabilitation and medical expenses to improve motor and physical function.Nelson, a family man, beloved coworker, and irreplaceable healer has committed his life to serving others.He began his journey as an IV tech during the AIDS crisis in New York and has stuck with the work ever since, serving patients who are IV dependent due to their chronic health conditions such as cancer and Chron's. Nelson always says, “If I can bring someone peace, happiness, or just make them smile, I’ve done my job.” His big heart and warm spirit is what makes him incomparable.Nelson works several jobs, not only because he is so committed to his patients, but he also financially supports his teenage son who lives with him, and his extended family who’s in Venezuela.Nelson’s recovery is crucial for him, his family, and for the countless of patients who count on him.To make this recovery process less stressful and financially burdensome on Nelson and his family, we are kindly asking that people share this campaign and donate if they are able too.Nelson may start intense rehab as soon as next week. Doctors are estimating that he will need a month to two months in a rehabilitation facility. The facility is $8,000-$10,000 a day, since insurance is unable to cover the stay.Even after Nelson leaves the facility, Doctors are advising that he will need an additional 3 months of home therapy before he can return to work.Anything that you are able to donate matters. All money will go towards medical bills and necessary living expenses. Thank you in advance for your support. 

The mother of Nelson’s son, Rosanna Perez, is helping Nelson organize and pay for medical expenses.

Aunque Nelson está mostrando signos de mejoría, necesitará meses de rehabilitación y gastos médicos para mejorar su función motora y física.Nelson es un hombre familiar, padre de un adolescente adorable, considerado por sus pacientes como un alma dulce y alegre, por su familia y amigos como un ser cargado de sabiduría y bondad, el cual ha dedicado su vida al servicio de los demás.Nelson comenzó su carrera como Terapista de Infusiones Intravenosas, homotoxicologia y homeopatía durante la crisis del SIDA en Nueva York , desde ese momento se ha mantenido al servicio incondicional de pacientes que son dependientes de estas terapias, debido a sus enfermedades crónicas de salud como el cáncer y los chrons . Nelson siempre dice: “con tan solo arrancarles una sonrisa a mis pacientes e inspirarles sentimientos de paz y salud, siento que mi trabajo ha sido cumplido”. Su gran corazón y su cálido espíritu es lo que hace a Nelson un ser único.Nelson trabaja en diferentes lugares, no solo porque está muy comprometido con sus pacientes, sino que también apoya económicamente a su hijo adolescente que vive con él y a su familiares que viven en Venezuela.La recuperación de Nelson es crucial para él, su familia y para los innumerables pacientes que cuentan con él.Para hacer que este proceso de recuperación represente menos angustia y económicamente sea menos pesado para Nelson y su familia, pedimos amablemente que las personas compartan esta campaña de apoyo y puedan realizar sus donaciones dentro de sus posibilidades.Nelson podría comenzar su rehabilitación intensa la próxima semana. Los médicos calculan que necesitará de un mes a dos meses en un Centro de Rehabilitación. La instalación cuesta entre $ 8,000 y $ 10,000 por día, ya que el seguro no puede cubrir la estadía.Incluso después de que Nelson abandone el Centro de Rehabilitación , los médicos advierten que necesitará 3 meses adicionales de terapia en casa, antes de poder regresar al trabajo.Ningún aporte es pequeño, lo que puedas donar es importante. Todo el dinero se destinará a facturas médicas y gastos de manutención necesarios, gracias por tu apoyo incondicional !

As long as Zann has been in my life, I have found them selflessly generous, fiercely loyal, and incredibly, unwaveringly supportive.As if Zann could get any more amazing, they have recently started the process of medically transitioning, a long-awaited step that Zann describes as 'life-saving.' On October 6th, Zann will undergo gender-affirming surgery in Regina, SK, and therefore be unable to work or support themself throughout their 2-month recovery period. It's Zann's turn to be on the receiving end of some care and support. I'll let Zann tell their story, and then let you know how you can help:""I’m in an exciting time of my life right now. I recently began taking steps to medically transition. This process began a long time ago within myself, and I’m glad that my outer self is becoming a more accurate reflection of my inner self thanks to the help of testosterone and supportive medical professionals. I’ve been waiting for top surgery for a long time, it’s amazing to me that my date has finally arrived.I experienced gender euphoria in a big way when i began to bind my chest 2 years ago. Binding helped me see myself as I had always wanted to see myself, it helped my body make sense to me. Unfortunately binding is extremely uncomfortable and hard on the body, and after doing it for a long time and discussing options with my doctor, i knew top surgery would be the best option for my mental and physical health.I’ve struggled to picture a future for myself for my whole life and have had depression off and on since I started puberty. It’s hard to explain just how impactful starting hormones was for me, but it was the feeling of my soul entering my body. It felt like finding a piece of me that had always been missing. I quit nicotine immediately, which was a huge feat for me. I started to care about the ways i had habitually been slowly hurting myself. Knowing I’m supported in having my body match my mind makes me look forward to the future, it feels like my life has finally just been beginning. My mental and physical health has improved since I began transitioning and I know top surgery is only going to amplify the good that has already been happening within me. Since coming out as trans I’ve been touched by how many people care for me, accept me, believe me, and want what’s best for me. Thanks for being in my life and helping me build a future I can be my whole self in. ""HOW YOU CAN HELPGiven Zann is a professional cook , the physical nature of their work requires that they take at least 6 weeks off to fully recover. In that time, Zann will be unable to earn the money needed to cover rent, car payments, insurance, food, prescription medication, etc.Money from this campaign will go directly toward Zann's living expenses so they can focus on their healing and recovery without having to worry about making ends meet.If we can all spare a bit of money to help see a dear friend through, we can make a huge impact on their sense-of well-being during a really intense and exciting time. Please consider sharing this campaign as we help Zann continue to live their life as their best self.Read more"

He and the doctors at UCLA discussed plans for the future of the brain tumors. (a glioma and an acoustic neuroma) The tumors are getting bigger and will continue to threaten his life & daily functions if Oz does nothing.It's time. Oz and the doctors both agreed to operate to remove both of them, with two separate surgeries.1.  First, there is a huge challenge from the remaining medical bills from hospitalizations on October 2020, (seizures) and for December 2020 (oz had Corona virus) and also trips to see doctors in LA last year for consult & testing for surgery plans. 2.  Second, there are current financial challenges for upcoming surgeries. Oz & Annie have to come up with co-pays, deductibles, transportation, food costs. Additionally both of them will be missing work during the surgery and recovery process.Breakdown of challenges: A) Oz’s medical bills from 2020 still due $12,246.00 and transportation, hotels, etc. was $2304.00B) Insurance deductible for 2021 is $2000.00 plus first tier 2 co-pay will be $7350.00 & any MRI, x-rays, medical devices used will be additional costs 20/80% split for charges and also hospital stay (this is unknown) C) Hotel stays for 2 surgeries for approximately 18 days each in Los Angeles and San Diego will be $7488.00 (not including food and transportation, time off work) Right now, it is an unknown how much BOTH brain surgeries will cost after insurance or what willhappen when Oz is recovering from both separate surgeries. This is a long road Annie and Oz are facing and they need your prayers more than anything. Totals from above are $31,388 PLUS any UNKNOWN costs they are asking for $50K.Oz cannot drive, fly or work (perform) for approximately 4-6 monthsbecause ofthepotential seizures and time for recovery. Also, Annie will be missing work during and after the surgeries as she helps to take care of Oz at the hotels and at home. Anything that is given will go directly to the costs incurred to help to Oz & Annie with medical bills and supplement any income lost.Oz has been in Stryper for over 38 years as a founding member and is in manydifferent bands in Las Vegas—Sin City Sinners, Hart Attack & Bloodgood. God has used his joy filled soul and zest for life in somany ways with countless people! When you meet Oz--you feel likeyou've known him all your life! He is a wonderful son, dad, grandfather, husband,musician, but most of all a faithful, reliable and loyal friend. He would give his shirt off his back to help anyone in need--that’s who he is.

You'll receive an auto-reply with more information on how you can make a direct donation.Block Club Chicago ArticleCBS2 Chicago News SegmentMy dad is the hardest working individual I know. He is one of nine siblings and grew up in rural South Korea. With no formal education, he left his family behind and emigrated to the United States in 1985 in order to pursue the American Dream. He sacrificed everything, working tirelessly 7 days a week to establish a humble business and provide his family with a better life than he had. In a single day, his entire livelihood was destroyed by looters and vandals.(That's me and my dad. I was a cranky baby.)As a non-essential business, he was adversely impacted by COVID-19 when non-essential retail was forced to close in mid-March. He was eagerly awaiting June 3rd, the day Illinois was entering Phase 3, allowing these businesses to reopen. However, on May 31st, his stores were looted and we received a call from the alarm company. The metal security gate had been breached. The door and windows were shattered and multiple alarms were triggered, but they couldn’t get through to 911 dispatch, so help was not coming. My dad rushed to his business and helplessly watched from his car as large groups stole merchandise, tore everything off the walls, toppled shelves, and smashed the glass display cases and cash register. The goods which weren’t stolen were thrown to the ground and trampled on.My husband and I drove the 12 hours straight from New York to Chicago the next morning. We had seen the escalation of events on the news, the live streams of looting and vandalism throughout the country, but now it hit very close to home. Seeing the destruction in person as we sifted through trying to salvage what remained, was nothing short of traumatic.My dad has been rooted in the South Side of Chicago for over 35 years, employing many residents of the Bronzeville and surrounding communities. The amount of loss is devastating and far exceeds anything insurance will cover. The loss of merchandise, property damage, and costs to repair and rebuild exceed $500,000. Along with decades of hard work, his sense of security has been taken from him. He fears that he won’t be able to recover from the physical and emotional toll of seeing everything he built up senselessly destroyed, knowing no one was coming to help.What’s given us hope are the helpers who have stepped forward during these trying times to offer a caring hand. Whether it’s strangers from the neighborhood cleaning up debris, the friends who took time off of work to pack up salvageable materials, or my dad’s employees who came in to help despite my dad having no way to pay them.The most important thing is that my dad is home safe after this ordeal, something that can’t be said for George Floyd and the many before him. Our hearts and thoughts go out to those who have suffered discrimination, oppression, and violence. We cannot even begin to fathom what it means to be in their shoes, but we remain committed to taking action needed to bring about change.As my family takes steps forward, we humbly ask for your assistance, no matter how small, in rebuilding my dad’s livelihood. Although it’s a long way to recovery, we hope to get there with your help.With gratitude,Sandra NaFor Verification Purposes:1.

This last year has been challenging for everyone, and I’ve been doing my best to navigate the 2020 curve balls shared by so many.Whether you know me personally or follow my social media accounts you know about my little dog Elliott. Whether in-person with his wiggly tail and silly personality or through photos and videos I have shared with you over the years. Elliott has been in my life since he was just a few weeks old and just turned 12! I've been his rock, but more so, he has been mine.Earlier this year we had a cancerous tumor (soft tissue sarcoma) removed from Elliott’s leg that had been growing over the past year. He did so well with the surgery and was on his way to recovery when we got the scare of our life. Elliott had started coughing and wheezing during the day and that night we woke up to Elliott struggling to breathe. By the morning I could tell this was an emergency. Not being able to get an appointment with a vet we rushed Elliott over to the Emergency Vet Hospital where they promptly took him from my arms and rushed him inside for care.After lots of tears, uncertainty, and waiting the cardiologist called and gave us the news that Elliott is in a pretty advanced state of congestive heart failure. His lungs were filled with fluid and his heart was enlarged due to a leaky valve. They asked to keep him for 48 hours and planned to pump his lungs and keep him in an oxygen chamber overnight in hopes of helping him with his labored breath.After a lengthy explanation from the vet (which I’ll save you from), the good news is that Elliott, the strong little dude that he is, responded very well to the medications and the oxygen chamber.
After 24hrs in emergency care, we were sent home with my weary little man, lots of medication and a very hefty bill. After a 2 week check up (and more expensive bills) Elliott’s heart had reduced in size, there was zero fluid in his lungs, and his breathing was back to normal. The medications are working and the vet said he is recovering well! This was the best news we could possibly hope for considering our new circumstances.As congestive heart failure is a hereditary disease entirely caused by his genes, this was an unforeseen expense that couldn't have come at a more financially challenging time for me. Now that we have Elliott stable again and a new medication routine that he will be on for the remainder of his life, I am asking for some support with these emergency costs.Elliott’s emergency care, check up and initial medication costs have totaled well over $3000. The last year has been so financially challenging and I am not in the position to afford all this unexpected large cost.I know the last year has been emotionally and financially trying for so many people, so I fully understand and respect if some folks are not in the position to support. If you are able to share my fundraiser instead of donating that would be greatly appreciated.For those that are in the position to support, Elliott and I would greatly appreciate it. Love Lucas <3

Thank you for visiting our page. Our little Phoebe Nugget needs your support!A couple days ago, Ashley and Nick woke up to Ms. Phoebe whimpering in pain and slightly dragging her feet. She was rushed to the veterinarian, where they examined her, and placed her on bed rest and medication because of suspected intervertebral disc disease. Within hours of going home, Phoebe's condition progressed even worse. Nick decided to get a second opinion and rushed her to an emergency vet. There doctors quickly decided that Phoebe would need emergency surgery or else she would be paralyzed.With an 80-90% success rate, there was no questioning of the decision of going forward with the surgery. That night of March 14, the doctors took Phoebe into the operating room. We are relieved to report that the surgery went smooth, and our Nugget has feelings in her toes! Now there is still a long road ahead with no guarantee that she will fully be able to walk, but that's what we are hoping for.In these next 4 weeks, she will be on very Strict bed rest and still have much more recovery after that. Due to the tough year we have all experienced, we have decided to reach out for support in the community.We ask that if you can donate anything in support of Phoebe and her wonderful dog parents, Ashley and Nick, that you please do so!

Being a husky mix, she’s known for not slowing down, no matter what, which is partly why I am asking for help. About two months ago, Lamb began having health issues that we were unable to diagnose right away. She has been experiencing a lot of discomfort, a few weeks of pretty intense pain, and a lot of stress on her body. Before we were able to diagnose her properly, we watched her unable to rest comfortably, stiff, crying out in pain while eating, and depressed. Our hearts were breaking as we did everything we could to figure out what was wrong. After two trips to the emergency vet, chiropractic and laser therapy appointments, bloodwork, 5 different vets, 2 misdiagnoses and an MRI and spinal fluid tap, we finally found out that she has two protruding discs at the top of her neck.We thought we had the answer when she was prescribed steroidal anti-inflammatories. For about two weeks it seemed like she was beginning to become herself again - high energy, cuddling as close as possible, and gobbling her food up as fast as possible. The relief we felt was immense, and we were able to start enjoying (somewhat restricted) life with her again. About three days ago though, she started slowing down again, and her neck began stiffening. At the moment of writing this, she is holding her head up at an angle and unable to even lay down so she can rest and heal. After another rush visit to the vet, our best option at this time is surgery. Her body is just unable to heal itself without it. We have had over two months of unexpected costs, and simply do not have the means to cover this surgery at this time. Both myself and my partner, Amanda, being in the food industry, we were hit pretty hard financially over the pandemic. We have already spent roughly $6500 trying to figure out what was wrong with her and then treating the issue. That being said, we are not ready to give up on Lambic healing and being able to live a full and happy life. She is constantly mistaken for a puppy; often people will ask how old she is, and when told “7” will ask, “7 months?” It’s been heartbreaking watching this incredibly energetic, lively, goofy, loving dog not be able to do the things she loves, and us not be able to love her with the kisses, cuddles, and pets she deserves. Lambic is the kind of dog that makes you question why we deserve dogs at all. She will makes you smile on even your worst days with her love. She loves unreservedly and with all she has, and deserves to be given every opportunity to get better. Over the 7 years that I have been lucky to spend with Lambic, she’s has come through for me countless times with exactly the support I need at the time, no judgement, just love. For Amanda, Lambic was the company needed to get her through the toughest days during the pandemic, when it was just the two of them at home. Lamb is lovingly nicknamed Wiggle Butt, and we’d love any help to help our girl get her butt wiggling again. Lambic turns 8 on November 26th, and there is nothing more that we want than to be able to celebrate that day with her feeling as well as possible. We are asking for help covering the cost of surgery and a week’s stay at the vet (10-12k), any medications that may be needed during recovery, and follow up appointments and scans that may be necessary to make sure she is healing properly (3-5k). Any amount helps, and is beyond appreciated. Love,Lambic, Justin and Amanda For those interested, the actual procedure that Lamb will need to undergo:Surgery involves creating a small window in the bone around the spinal cord to gain access to the disc material. Because of the proximity to her spine, it must be done by a highly trained canine neurologist. The material is removed, relieving the spinal cord compression and allowing healing to take place.She'll be having this in two spots at C2 and C3.Read more"

It is a rare but serious autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks healthy nerve cells in your peripheral nervous system. It can cause weakness, numbness and tingling, and eventually paralysis.Last week Quinn was complaining of pains in her legs. Assuming it was growing pains, she went to bed expecting it would be gone by the morning. The next morning Quinn woke up unable to feel or move her legs. Her parents rushed her to the nearest Hospital (Welland Emergency) and once they assessed her they decided that she immediately needed to be transferred to the St. Catharines pediatric department. She got a cat scan done and they ruled out meningitis and a tumour. With results coming back inconclusive, they rushed her to McMaster Hospital in Hamilton. They wereadmitted by 11:30pm and by 3:30am her muscle failure had rapidly taken over her body. Her respiratory muscles began to shut down and left her unable to breath. They had to resuscitate her and insert a breathing tube. She is receiving IVIG and nerve medication to help stimulate the nerve growth. The breathing tube has since been taken out and she is able to breathe on her own. She is in the painful process of regaining some motor skills, but is unable to walk, feed herself, and go to the bathroom alone. Doctors are optimistic, however they are not able to give her parents a set time frame as to when she will be leaving the hospital, or when she will be able to walk again. As of now, she will continue to recover in the hospital until they feel she is strong enough to go home. From there, she will need to receive tremendous amounts of physical therapy in order to regain full muscle control.Her family’s top priority is being there for Quinn. Her parents and twin sister Maple are spending most of their time in the hospital so she is not alone. It is proving to be difficult to keep up with work and hospital visits.

Anyone that knows Rick will be asking what they can do to help him. And while we can’t take this medical burden away from him, we can help ease the financial burden that has been put on the family.


Let’s also use the power of prayer and positivity.Please say a prayer, and send Rick words of encouragement. He is always the first person to help others. Let’s surround him with love and cheer him on to a fast recovery.

Thank you to family and friends for your love and support!

If you've zoomed into my house even once (or follow my Instagram stories), you probably know Mabu by his tiny squeaks in my face when it's time for food, his little hops onto my lap in the middle of meetings, and his constant zoomies behind me as I'm trying to make an important point. Tiny gremlin he may be, but he also means the absolute world to me.And this tiny boy needs surgery!(TW potentially gruesome surgery details below)Before Mabu came into my life, he was an outdoor barn cat, and broke his leg as a kitten. When they fixed it, they had to put a steel plate in his leg, and now the metal they inserted into his leg has started growing bacteria on it. To fix this, they need to cut in and remove all the metal in his leg which includes the steel plate, three wires, plus six screws.During the recovery process (because one the screws are removed, his bone is going to have six giant holes in it - ""like swiss cheese,"" the surgeon said helpfully), he needs to stay inside a crate by himself for 6-8 weeks while his leg heals fully so he doesn't jump around and potentially break it again.(/TW)I'm asking for $2500 as the high estimate they gave me for the surgery, plus the initial anesthesia blood work they needed to do. I truly hate asking for help so much, but on a grad student budget and no job prospects in sight just yet, I just cannot afford this on my own. Even if I don't reach the full goal, any amount will go towards helping me pay it off!!Thank you so, so much to anyone that's able to contribute!!!

He went to the ER in Cary (Western Wake) where they initially couldn't figure out his symptoms. He had a major decline and ultimately ended up at Duke, having emergency surgery on Feb. 23. Kesh had suffered an aneurysm of his upper and lower aorta. They gave him very slim odds of surviving the surgery. In true Kesh fashion, he pulled through and exceeded the doctor's expectations. Kesh left the hospital on March 1 and is recovering at home. He now faces an estimated six months of recovery and appointments. Kesh was unaware of any issues with his arteries, as most people are. His condition is genetic. This is the ultimate example of how you should cherish the people in your life and never take anything for granted. Anything can happen.We are so fortunate that he is here with us now and of course, that's what matters but our friend needs our help. In January of 2020, Kesh began working to establish his own HVAC business. Like many business owners, Kesh's ability to make income was severely hindered by COVID. He had already depleted much of his savings and now faces the reality of a health crisis as a business owner with no medical insurance.Kesh has been treated at two hospitals and is facing many more months of appointments and rehabilitation. We are looking into options and what to expect as far as the final medical bills. We know for sure, at this time, that Kesh won't be able to work for at least the next six months. While we wait for a more clear picture of what we're dealing with as far as the medical portion, right now, my goal is for Kesh to be able to focus on resting and getting better and to still be able to keep up with his monthly bills and whatever he needs.

His life has been saved. Thank you all for sharing, posting, praying, donating and lending a helping hand. The family is elated and trying to let it all sink in. There’s a long road of recovery ahead but we are determined to continuing the push forward in order to give this story a happy ending!Your continued prayers and support are greatly appreciated. Original Post:Ernest Adzentoivich is dying. He is a dad, husband, son and friend who suffers from a very rare and complicated disease called Nodular Regenerative Hyperplasia with Portal Hypertension (NRH). The origins of this disease are unknown. There are no foundations or advocacy groups for NRH. There is no standard protocol of treatment.He is dying. He has uncontrolled internal bleeding, ascites, osteoporosis, anemia, adema, GAVE of the stomach, kidney failure and many other complications. He needs an O liver ASAP in order to save his life. We had been looking for someone who is in the position to direct the donation of a loved one's liver upon their death because he is not eligible for a cadaveric liver through UNOS (read full story below).Fortunately, through this journey and much outreach, we’ve learned that there are a few medical centers in the United States who will perform a Living Donor Liver Transplant (LDLT), which is an amazing procedure. Doctors in Italy and Holland have successfully performed this type of transplant on NRH patients and the team at Stanford believes that this will work to save his life!We’ve had several people offer to be tested to be a donor. What a true blessing. Complete unfettered selfless generosity. Simply beautiful. But all of this comes at a tremendous cost. We have relocated our entire family to the Palo Alto area (but we’ve left our big dogs at home with other family members, so you thieves better not get any ideas;)) and set up in a comfortable apartment which we’ve gotten for a steal because they’re doing construction. Again, a blessing! But nothing in Silicon Valley comes cheap. We need all the help we can get. Please. THE ORIGINAL PLEA:UNOS, the organization that governs organ transplant in the US, does not include NRH in its list of conditions that qualify for transplant. The MELD score used to prioritize patients on the wait list for a liver does not take into consideration the specifics of this condition, and as such, Ernest will never get to the top of the transplant list as it stands today.As we wait, the family is incurring debt in the form of lost wages for both Ernest and Nancy, medical bills, copays, prescriptions, hospital parking, food, gas, childcare and general day-to-day stuff. There is no estimation for how long he will be in this waiting stage - things could take a turn in either direction at any moment. Having a financial cushion would greatly reduce the stress and anxiety we are all facing at this time.￼￼￼￼Ernest is enrolled in two studies at The National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD in the hopes that his suffering may help others who come after him. The family is committed to raising awareness and support for people suffering from NRH and non-Cirrhotic Portal Hypertension once this ordeal has resolved.*This campaign has been set up by me, Nancy Adzentoivich, wife of Ernest Adzentoivich. My family and I plan to use all donated funds to transport Ernest safely to Stanford Medical Center, support the family’s travel to Northern California, pay rent for housing while we are living out of town during the transplant and recovery (3-4 months), and to assist our living donor with travel to, and accommodations near, the medical center. Funds raised will also cover some of the out of pocket medical expenses that are associated with such a complicated procedure and recovery.

Jude is one of the most genuine and selfless people I have ever met and need our help. Their beloved family member, Monster, is in the hospital and in need of emergency surgery. This is his second surgery since December due to intervertebral disk disease, which required Jude to max out their credit to cover.

They would never ask for help directly, but are in a difficult situation to provide care they can't afford. It is really heart wrenching to see Jude and Monster go through this, and to see them in so much pain. Monster deserves a happy and long life and with one more surgery, the prognosis is good.

A little backstory:

In November we found out that Monster has intervertebral disk disease. He lost use of his hind limbs and the surgery in December was a success - he gained back full use of his legs. Unfortunately, yesterday he was in pain and losing mobility of his hind, left leg. The vet found that he has more significant damage, including loss of hind limb motor function and the ability to empty his bladder completely.

Monster is currently in the hospital and in need of immediate surgery. With one more surgery, the prognosis is good. But without, disc rupture can lead to permanent and significant issues.

Costs for tests, medication, his hospital stay, and surgery is $4,800. Every penny raised will go directly towards Monster's vet bill and recovery.

Jude adopted Monster and he is the most adorable and lovable. He loves playing with his best buddy, JoJo the cat, pulling out every single toy from his toy box, chasing his tail, and snuggling with his family.

Beyond grateful for any help towards this unexpected and expensive surgery. Thank you for your love and support.

For years she has taught mentally and physically challenged middle and high school students in the Salt Lake City/Canyons school district and is a Para Education tutor for special needs children. Among family and friends, Frieda is the one who 'always shows up.' When she had time for herself she hiked mountain trails and began entering and winning body sculpting competitions. But late in 2019, she was diagnosed with a cancerous pancreatic tumor that had attached to other vital organs. Because it was attached, it was considered inoperable. Her oncologist began the first of eight rounds of chemotherapy and radiation to shrink or stop the tumor growth. While it slowed growth, it did little more. Her oncologist, meanwhile was relentlessly looking for answers. Miraculously, he found one in a specialized and renowned cancer surgeon at Mayo Clinic willing to perform the 10 hour, very risky surgical procedure to remove the tumor. Frieda's insurance just cleared her for the out-of-State procedure. For the first time in over a year, Frieda, her family and friends have hope. The surgery and recovery will require her and a caregiver to move this March for over a month to a condominium near the Mayo Clinic. They will reside there through April, barring any medical complications.

When the bushfire hit just before Christmas AKR was inundated with calls from Hills residents and emergency services needing help for koalas and other wildlife with burns and other injuries.Due to a lack of other resources, it was necessary for AKR to quickly establish and self-fund a temporary koala triage facility in a primary school gym at Paradise. Within weeks up to 120 koalas were being treated at any one time and more than 300 koalas and other wildlife were rescued. More than 300 volunteers were recruited including over 80 veterinary professionals and the site became more like a field hospital.Throughout last year AKR continued to rescue around 50 koalas each month requiring treatment and rehabilitation mostly due to road trauma, dog attack and illness. AKR relocated to a temporary facility at Campbelltown in the north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide and established a wildlife rehabilitation facility. We spent much of last year desperately trying to find a new and permanent home for our essential operation and service which was hindered by the Covid-19 crisis among other challenges.The bushfire was the catalyst for the organisation AKR has become. Even before the bushfire it was apparent that the model for koala rescue and rehabilitation for us had to change. The old model of having individual wildlife carers operating from home was no longer viable or efficient in treating the volume of animals needing help. Becoming a wildlife rehabilitation facility was a step in the right direction as centralised operations made for better coordination of rescue and treatment of wildlife and improved animal welfare standards.In 2021 AKR is taking another big leap forward by establishing it's own veterinary clinic. We have secured a long-term lease on an amazing 90 acre property at Lenswood in the Adelaide Hills where among other things we are establishing a native plant nursery and sanctuary. The generous donations from people like you are enabling AKR to build and develop a wildlife rescue, treatment, rehabilitation and research facility that will service the Adelaide Hills and metropolitan area even better than before. We welcome any of our supporters to visit our facility in the near future to see first hand how your donations have been invested.AKR's new home and your donations will enable us to fulfill our vision of establishing a dedicated facility to help koalas and other wildlife both during natural disasters like bushfires and every other day throughout the year. There is and will be no other comparable service in South Australia. AKR is research focused providing evidence-based treatment - we are actively involved in crucial post-bushfire research that will help save koalas in the future.AKR is a not for profit organisation and registered Australian charity providing a free 24/7 wildlife rescue service to the South Australian community 365 days of the year. The cost of saving SA's koalas is funded by our charity and we need your support.Your donation will help pay for:- Veterinary expenses including medication, laboratory testing and x-rays- Formula and nutritional supplements for handraised joeys and koalas in rehab- Rescue and recovery equipment- Materials for outdoor enclosures including fencing and roofingYour support means we can continue saving SA's koalas.

We (her 4 children) are utterly heartbroken but are grateful that she's no longer struggling and in pain. We will update this page with her Celebration of Life details as they unfold. All funds raised through this campaign will now go towards her final arrangements and affairs. Thank you all so much for your generous support.On Thursday August 2nd @ 5:15pm our 61 year old mother, Veronica Kirkland, was involved in a head-on car accident. While her seatbelt saved her life, it also caused incredible internal damage. Every rib on her right side is fractured as is her lumbar vertebrae 1 & 2 and her right ankle was shattered. Her broken ribs punctured her diaphragm in 2 places as well as her lung cavity. She had her spleen AND colon removed completely and is left with 1/3 of her small intestine. She will likely lose as least 3 fingers from slow blood circulation. She’s already had 7 surgeries with at least a few more this week. IF she makes it through this very critical time, her road to recovery will be very long and very hard. She is currently in an ICU in the Bay Area in critical conditional and on life support.The last 2 months have been immensely stressful for her. She recently relocated from Santa Cruz, CA to Northeastern Texas for a fresh new start after having difficulty finding consistent work in CA. Sadly, all of her belongings became infested with Bedbugs from the moving company and she lost everything she owned. After a few weeks of just plain bad luck, she decided to head back to the Bay area. She arrived on Wednesday August 1st and the accident happened the very next day.Our Mom is single and has no family in the area, even her friends are quite a distance from the hospital. Her 4 children (Amethyst, Angelene, Andrew and April) hopped in cars and planes around the United States to get to her and are with her now. All of us work in fields where we don’t get paid if we aren’t at work. Because of the forest fires up in Northern California, many people are migrating south and the hotel rooms close to the hospital are extremely expensive if available at all. We know it is giving her strength having her children by her side, but resources are minimal as we have a very small family. Funds raised will go towards:Immediate needs- housing, food, car rental & gas etc. so her children can stay with her until she is awake and more stable Long term needs- Medical bills which have started to accumulate, rotating at least 1 child at a time to be with her over the next 6 months, a car (for when she can drive as hers was totaled), accommodations suitable for her physical limitations once she is out of constant medical care, etc.None of us have any experience with any of this and we are really learning as we go here.

Thank you for coming here to read about my kitty's sad journey.We got Rocky from a breeder in our city and he was a healthy, happy kitten at 12weeks old. He played all day long and we all had so many laughs watching his antics. He was loud, obnoxious, full of life and the most affectionate animal I have ever encountered. Him and my daughter with Down syndrome became and inseparable pair and he would scream the house down to be with her when she would wake in the mornings and they would cuddle throughout the day. We felt like our lives were complete. He was everything we could have dreamed of in a family pet and he adored our children.One day at the beginning of September (2020), I noticed one of his eyes looking irritated and going cloudy and he kept rubbing it on everything. Things continued to escalate from there and a corneal ulcer appeared. He was diagnosed with uveitis and herpes. His eye got so bad and wasn't responding to any meds or treatments. His eye began to go black and buldge into his skull, so he ended up with an enucleation. This was excruciating pain for Rocky and lasted 6 weeks. Then 2 weeks of the cone, he was depressed beyond belief.Since this time, Rocky has declined. He does not want to interact and he does not play. He just wants to hide in his hooded bed in the kitchen all day every day.The past few weeks he was peeing around the house, and licking the walls, doors and floors. It was alarming me but my partner brushed it off and suggested he was just dehydrated because he just didn't like his water bowl or that maybe his litter needed changed, so we bought him a water fountain and changed his litter every day then and he still kept urinating around the house. I still thought it was strange because his litter had always been changed every 2 days and he never had an issue beforehand.Then he didn't pee for days and started having extremely foul diarrhea. I took him to the vet who said he had a UTI. He started peeing again but he is peeing while laying in bed and not moving from it. Now he is having mobility issues with his hind legs. When he attempts to walk, the back legs are hunching down, involuntarily jerking and swaying. If I rub his back legs, he attacks me and that's not him at all. He is also very confused, walking backwards and shaking his head alot. Plus he seems to have Nystagmus in his remaining eye.So today, 16th Dec, I took him to the emergency vets. Believing he has dry FIP as he has all the textbook symptoms. The vet said she believes he has a congenital condition and she said that he ""isn't a normal cat"" and he needs extensive tests, treatment and care and the possibility of medication and said that it will cost me a tonne.I do not know what to do, or what to expect and I am struggling financially as my partner lost his job due to the pandemic and I stay at home to care for my disabled child. We do not have the means to provide Rocky with the care he needs and we are terrified that he may need euthenised to prevent his suffering long term and not having a diagnosis to be able to properly treat him.It has took alot for me to actually make a gofundme and post this, as I do not like to take from people and I feel that Rocky is my kitten and my responsibility. However we are currently desperate to save our beloved Rocky. We adore him and my kids are obsessed with him, we just want him to be well again and happy. He is only 9months old and has no quality of life and it feels inhumane. So I guess this is my last resort and some people have said they wanted to help out. I do not expect anything, and I do not expect the amount shown, it was just suggested to me. I do not know how much his specialist fees will cost until we are able to start going down that route and take him there for consultations etc. I also want to start him on FIP medication because I feel that it may be the last chance he has. Alot of people have had great experiences with this medication and their cats have made full recoveries. That is my wish for my kitten.I appreciate $1 at this point. And if you have read this far, I appreciate you taking an interest! Thank you in advance!Read more"

As the day progressed, so did the weather. Quicker than time would allow for an escape, the weather made a rapid change. Suddenly Justin’s golf partners discovered Justin on the ground after being violently struck by lightening. Friends and bystanders assisted Justin and 911 was called. Justin is currently being treated at the UMC burn unit in Las Vegas, Nevada. Family and friends remain hopeful that he will make a full recovery. However, his journey through recovery will be a difficult one, especially without the ability to return to work for some time. It is our goal as his friends to ensure that he can come home and make a recovery without the fear of finances. Please help us make that possible and keep Justin and his family in your prayers."

OLIVER!

Our source of love and light is in need of your help. Always the first one to the food bowl, we noticed he had stopped eating completely Sunday. After taking him to the vet & the emergency specialist here in Tampa, we have discovered Oliver has a perforation in his stomach and a cancerous mass in his small intestine.

Without emergency help Oliver simply will not live.For Jonathan and I this is not a simple matter and has left us in complete shock. Never we would think to ask for donations but after running out of resources we are turning to our friends and compassion from the community.

After numerous blood tests, ultrasounds, cat scans, etcetera our worst fears have been confirmed. With anything you can give, it can save Oliver’s life.

We need to act aggressive as the tumors will spread and we still need to undergo the surgery to remove the Cancerous mass, in addition to recovery with the correct antibiotics.

This is our last ditch effort to save our family, and to some, he may be just a cat, but to his daddies, Oliver is our unit. Oliver is our companion, confidant, best cuddle monster, holder to our secrets, and has been our A1 since day 1. It’s hard to explain, but if you had the chance to meet Oliver, you would know how heavy our hearts are.

Please help in any way possible and we will also be sure to post the bills that are piling up in addition to the ones that will come.

We love you.

An alligator, simply described as “large,” had wandered into a residential neighborhood and made himself at home in the community retention pond. Brian watched from a distance as Frank raised his hands to his mouth and made a noise that sounded exactly like a baby alligator calling for his momma. The noise instantly piqued the interest of the large alligator and he began swimming towards Frank to investigate. While most of us would run the other way, Frank got closer to the edge of the water and attempted to catch the alligator using a fishing pole. Suspicious and leery of a baby alligator that stands 6-feet-tall, the large reptile disappeared down into the murky water. From years of experience, Frank knew he would have to give this alligator a little space and try again in a few hours. Walking over to Brian, introductions were made, and the two men began discussing a strategy for catching the reptile. By the end of afternoon, the unwelcomed pond guest was successfully captured, and a friendship began that brought one of the kindest, most respectful and humble human beings I have ever met into my family’s life. Alligator trapping is not a career one chooses for the purpose of making money, nor is it a career for the timid. The hours are erratic with call outs in the middle of the night, the pay is nominal, and there is no medical insurance. There is also no shortage of danger associated with handling alligators. Equipped with 80 teeth, a body of armor, and the ability to run 20 mph, catching alligators and re-homing them takes someone who has nerves of steel and cat-like reflexes. Training, experience and education are a must. Frank possesses all these traits, plus a natural born talent, all his own. To give a great example of Frank’s incredible talent, in July of 2019, the city of Chicago found itself the host of an unusual guest. A five-foot alligator was spotted in the Humboldt Park Lagoon and it was drawing a large crowd. After a week of evading capture, the city knew they needed a little extra help and “Alligator Robb,” was at the top of their list. Flown in on a Sunday night, Frank captured the elusive gator Monday night, using his unique and extremely effective alligator call. The city was both amazed and grateful, and “Chance the Snapper” was rehomed at the St. Augustine Alligator Farm and Zoological Park, in St. Augustine, Florida. Through the entire event, Frank was true to his nature, humble in both mind and action, and thanked God for his Grace and Blessings. With the spotlight shining on him, Frank took this opportunity to educate the world about alligators, wildlife and the environment. Using his own time and money, Frank launched “EEARSS,” (Environmental Educational Awareness Research Support and Services) a non-profit organization, which he built from the ground up. EEARSS is an organization which both my husband and I believe and participate in as active Board Members. Frank’s passion for education is surpassed only by his desire to help unwanted and misunderstood creatures of all types, and when not doing either of those, he is creating coloring books for children to help them learn about alligators, as well. With such a busy schedule, it is no wonder Frank was beginning to feel a bit run down, but unfortunately, it became more than just that. Short of breath and energy, Frank finally went to the doctors in October, where he underwent tests and learned his heart was not working properly. Doctors then confirmed his worst fear, he needed heart surgery. As the news sank in, Frank’s doctor then told him due a previous chest surgery as a child, he was considered high risk, making the bad news even worse.No one wants to hear they need heart surgery. Everything about it is stressful and scary. The procedure always comes with risks and the recovery is long, uncomfortable and exhausting. The steps just leading up to surgery are both mentally and physically draining, and if that is not enough, Frank has additional worries – big ones. To date, Frank has still not found a surgeon willing to take on a high-risk patient, much less one who does not have insurance. He is also concerned about how he will support himself in the months following the surgery, when catching wildlife and alligators is not an option. Then, on top of it all, how will he even pay for surgery, a surgery his life depends on? There are a lot of people in the world who need help. There are not as many who have spent their entire life in the service of helping others. Frank Robb, with his humble, grateful, gracious, kind, respectful and funny disposition needs help. On Frank’s behalf, my family and I ask for your help, and hope together we can raise the funds needed for Frank’s surgery and recovery. The world is definitely a better place with Frank Robb in it and there is no doubt that he is not done educating the world about wildlife, including one of the last remaining dinosaurs, the American Alligator. Funds are needed immediately, so please donate today.

She fought back. Somewhere in the night her brain registered enough on her EEG to show us she was with us, and fighting hard.

She is now 7 weeks old, healthy, active, and continues to show us the gift of love and life every day. Unfortunately, she can’t breast feed yet, and her Momma (Jessica) faithfully pumps every 3 hours to produce the milk Jinger needs. Formula is hard on her stomach, and breast milk is a high priority in her recovery. Normally, Jess could rent a decent pump from WIC, but Covid restrictions won’t allow this. The pump she currently has is not allowing her to produce enough milk to keep up with Jinger’s needs. We would like to purchase a hospital grade pump, which ranges anywhere from $1000 to $2000. When Jessica is finished with the pump, she would donate it to another Mom in need.

For the past ten years, I (Russell) have watched my wife Katherine battle a rare genetic disorder. It has affected her connective tissues, her autonomicnervous system, and multiple organ systems in her body.Despite her doctor's best efforts, Katherine's condition has deteriorated. Last year, she was diagnosed with intestinal failure. Since September of last year, her only source of nutrition and fluid has been through a central line to her heart. She has also continued to receive bimonthly infusions of immunoglobulin that help to keep her disease from progressing further. Katherine is currently being treated by some of the best gastrointestinal doctors in the world, and has been recommended for intestinal transplant.Though we are thankful for these life-saving interventions, they present a constant risk of complications. She has had multiple hospitalizations over the past few months, and had three central lines replaced due to infection.As Katherine’s illness has progressed, she has lost the ability to drive, and struggles to complete many simple daily tasks on her own. Our 11-year old has also begun to show symptoms of the same disease, and has lost the ability to walk. Out of necessity, I have become a full-time caretaker for our family. This has been very difficult for usfinancially.Katherine’s IVig treatments are $12,000.00 per month. Her TPN is $6,500.00 per month. Her IV fluids are $2,700.00 per month. The transplant her physicians have recommended would cost $2 million dollars. Medicare/Medicaid won’t approve many of the treatments Katherine’s doctors have prescribed for her. When they do approve treatments, they only pay a fraction of the cost, which would leave us owing hundreds of thousands of dollars.A private health plan would cover the majority of these expenses, but the monthly premiums for a plan like this are upwards of $2000.00 per month. In order for Katherine to be listed for transplant, we will have to obtain one of these plans. Katherine's transplant team has advised us to start fundraising for those expenses not covered by insurance. These funds will help us cover deductibles, the cost of traveling to and from D.C. for appointments, housing near the hospital during her 6-month recovery, and living expenses while I serve as her full-time caretaker.We thank you for your help and kindness. If you can't help us financially, please also consider praying for Katherine’s doctors to have wisdom, and that our two children would be comforted as they deal with so many challenging situations.— Russell Berger

LOTS AND LOTS OF PRAYERS PLEASE My beautiful daughter, who I just posted about her 25 birthday on Monday, was in a terrible car accident yesterday. She had surgery for bleeding on her brain. She will need another one for a broken bone in her neck. She is on a ventilator and heavily sedated. We are beside ourselves with fear and concern. My husband, who wants nothing to do with Facebook, asked me to reach out for prayers for her. So here I am. Please take a moment to pray for our darling Lauren. She is so hurt and in so much pain. Pray for her recovery. The doctors say the next 24-48 hours are very critical. Thank youUPDATE 2/20/2021 from Lauren's Mother:Here's my latest update... Lauren is getting better. She had a good night. Cat scans of her brain look good. Waiting for the neurosurgeon to call with the results of her MRI. That’s for her neck. She will have another surgery most likely on Monday to stabilize her neck. There is something with the C6 bone that they need to fuse together. My brother said it’s not bad. Football players hurt that and are fine. It’s a bone that helps turn your head. After that surgery, if all goes well they will take her off the ventilator. I saw her yesterday. It was awful. She is so banged up. She has tubes and things all over her body. She was just lying there so motionless. I just watched her chest move up and down. It was comforting to watch her breath. I held her hand and said a million prayers. I only stayed for about 45 minutes. It was just too hard. Keep praying for her. She’s better but not 100% yet. I will update as I hear things later -Anyone who has ever had the pleasure of knowing or meeting Lauren knows she is beyond words amazing. She was always the first to help and make sure you felt like you belonged. I can say it was genuinely an honor to go to school with her since elementary days and play on the same team as kids. Even at that age Lauren was always so sweet and wanted to make sure everyone was okay. She made everyone feel like they had a friend. Better yet, a best friend. A beautiful girl who would give you the shirt off her back. Finding people as amazing as Lauren now in days is beyond rare. She is so sweet, humbling, generous and beautiful inside and out.She has the most infectious smile and attitude. You could never feel down when Lauren was around. Everyone who has met Lauren knows she is the sweetest and has a huge heart and beyond compassionate. She has inspired so many of us and helped us become better people with her loving and generous attitude towards life.

The specific condition Natalie had is called personality disorder. It is a condition that very little is known about and very little specialised support is available. Tyla May felt safest in hospital and was unable to access any psychological therapies beyond acute and community NHS provision. Whilst these services helped her recover from acute crisis, there was very little psychological therapy or sustainable support for her ongoing recovery. Tyla May struggled to access any meaningful formal support outside of immediate crisis to enable her to recover.We want to raise money for charities (and if possible research) to improve care services for people with personality disorder- to address stigmatisation and the lack of available psychological, recovery-focused support outside of acute hospitals. We also want to give Tyla May the send off she deserves and reduce some of the burden her parents and family are currently dealing with."

My 10 yr old baby girl has been going through an enormous amount of pain, going in and out of the ER.About 3 weeks ago, I started to notice Kelly wasn't eating or drinking water. She became weaker and weaker, and by the third day she didn't even have the energy to sit up. I rushed Kelly to the ER right away. They hooked her to an oxygen tank because she was having a lot of trouble breathing with a high fever of 105.8. They drew her blood and diagnosed her with pancreatitis and possible liver disease. They gave her antibiotics, pain killers, and some fluids right before I took her home for outpatient treatment where I monitored her temperature every hour, spoon fed her water/bland diet, and carried her in&out to pee. After a week, though still weak, she did start eating, drinking and walking on her own again. Things were looking good until exactly 2 weeks later. I'm assuming that her infection came back after the antibiotics wore off since I was informed that the antibiotics would only last 14 days. Kelly started getting weaker and stopped eating again. I rushed her to the ER for the second time when her temperature went up to 104.8. This time, the technician recommended me to go to a specialist ER instead.When I brought Kelly to the specialist hospital, they had to redo the examination, all the blood work, x-ray, etc.. After Kelly's emergency exam, the doctor told me that he feels a lot of fluids in Kelly's abdominal area and he suspects that it is Pyometra (infection in the uterus). We rushed her test results and they came back showing that the doctor's prediction was right. The doctor said Kelly needed surgery right away to remove all the fluids. However, he informed me that Kelly's body might already be septic and it is uncertain is she will make it out of surgery. Even if she makes it out of surgery, it is not guaranteed she will make it out of the hospital. Going into surgery Kelly was 10lbs, and by the end, she was only 8lbs. They removed over 1lb of fluids. That is 10%+ of her body weight. (CRAZY SCARY!!)Luckily, Kelly made it through surgery and it went well. The doctor asked to keep her hospitalized for at least 48hours for close monitoring of all her stats. These 48 hours are critical because her condition can fluctuate. Kelly was pretty much stable except for her high blood sugar levels. They were extremely high at the level of 500+ (keep in mind that normal is 80-120). The doctor confirmed that Kelly is now a diabetic patient and started her on insulin.24hrs post surgery, Kelly still had no interest in food and started non stop regurgitating. The doctor got worried and said if she doesn't stop regurgitating, she can get an infection in her esophagus. If that does happen, she will need to be transferred to another specialist hospital. The only other thing left they can do for me before they transfer her is to put a feeding tube through her nose into her stomach. They will be taking out her stomach acid every 4 hours. They asked to keep her for an additional 24 hours for close monitoring.At first, when my bill was at $5,000 and I wasn't going to create a go fund me. However, it increased to $7000 and it is more than likely going to keep increasing. I would really really appreciate any donations and support. Even if it is just a $1, it will add up. I want to thank you in advance for anyone taking the time to read this and for your support. Please keep Kelly in your prayers and help bring her back home into my arms. She is my baby girl.I've never really gone through anything like this so I'm having a really hard time processing everything. I've been there with Kelly ever since she was only 6weeks old. She is my first dog and she has been the love of my life for the past 10+ years. I love her more than anything and she is literally my EVERYTHING. No matter the amount of money, I won't be giving up and will try anything and everything for her. It would mean the world to me if you guys are able to help, even just a little bit.

I am devastated to let you guys know that sweet Junebug has been hit by a car and is injured very badly. She has severe bruising on her left lung, a mangled tail, fractured pelvis, and a fracture on her shoulder. She is going to need extensive surgery and medication if she is going to have a chance. I know that times are tough right now and we are all struggling to get by, but this sweet little cat is my entire world. If you have anything extra to give, I would be deeply grateful to you.*Update* Luckily, June was able to come out of the hospital sooner than anticipated as she was able to stabilize. Her tail has been removed and the back of her body was sewn back together. She has a lot of bruising and sutures. Her hips are also broken and dislocated. Needless to say, June is very uncomfortable and need a lot of attention to keep her wounds clean and her pain down.

Fortunately, because she came out of the hospital today, her vet bill was lower than I anticipated (hence me lowering the goal). Because her recovery requires so much attention, I am unable to work during this time so part of that money is going to supplies (like gloves, pee pads, saline solution, and medication refills) as well as helping towards my food and rent. I seriously appreciate all that everyone has done and your support is invaluable to me. I am overwhelmed by the love that June and I have received and despite the horror of this whole situation, I truly feel charmed (like the 90's witch show, not like you're shmoozing me). Anyways, I am deeply grateful to you all and will continue to update you on June's recovery!*Update*Unfortunately, June is going to need hip surgery after-all if we want to avoid her having chronic pain/long-term problems with mobility. I have once again raised the donation goal if you could send this link to anyone with a love for animals and the means to help. Thank you so much to everyone for your support.Another update 1/5/21Unfortunately, June's follow-up appointment did not go well. When she arrived, her body temperature was low and she had low blood pressure. They did some blood work and found that her white and red blood cells were very low and that she had very high levels of a liver enzyme that should have gone down after her surgery. She has been given a blood transfusion and some fluids and is going to need to be transferred to another vet so that she can be monitored more closely. This cat means so much to me and has shown so many people love. Please share far and wide so that I can do everything I can to help her.

On February 11, 2021, our mother Cristina at the age of 63 year old unfortunately suffered from an aneurysm rupture and has been in North Well Hospital ever since then. As a result, she is currently disabled and on a feeding tube. She has only been able to open her eyes and make some facial expressions. Recently, she began to move her hands but her recovery will take long.

Our mother doesn’t qualify for full health insurance due to her immigration status; she only qualifies for emergency stays at the hospital. These funds will help assure that we can provide her with all the necessary care items when she comes home. She needs mobility equipment such as a reclining wheel chair, Hoyer lift, tube feeding formula, medications, physical therapy and personal hygiene products. My family and mother will forever be grateful for all help and support. 

Those close to our mother know that she is a loving mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, and friend.

You can also show support by SHARING. Thank you.


El 11 de febrero de 2021, nuestra madre Cristina a la edad de 63 años lamentablemente sufrió una rotura de un aneurisma y ha estado en el North Well Hospital desde entonces. Como resultado, actualmente está discapacitada y con una sonda de alimentación. Solo ha podido abrir los ojos y hacer algunas expresiones faciales. Recientemente, comenzó a mover las manos, pero su recuperación tardará mucho.



Nuestra madre no califica para un seguro médico completo debido a su estatus migratorio; ella solo califica para estadías de emergencia en el hospital. Estos fondos ayudarán a asegurar que podamos proporcionarle todos los artículos de cuidado necesarios cuando regrese a casa. Necesita equipo de movilidad, como una silla de ruedas reclinable, un elevador Hoyer, fórmula de alimentación por sonda, medicamentos, fisioterapia y productos de higiene personal. Mi familia y mi madre siempre estarán agradecidas por toda la ayuda y el apoyo.

Quienes están cerca de nuestra madre saben que es una madre, abuela, hermana, tía y amiga amorosa.

También puede mostrar su apoyo COMPARTIENDO. Gracias.

This situation is not that. We live in a quiet, middle class, diverse and inclusive community driven, family friendly neighborhood, with a neighborhood watch where we all look out for one another.On Sunday, early evening, 2/21/21, 4-brothers, ranging in age from 9 to 26 years old were playing basketball at the park with other families enjoying the park, when 3-males approached on foot and asked “Hey, where you from?”. All three proceeded to start shooting and disappeared as quickly as they came.The 2nd youngest brother (my 12-yr old daughter’s classmate), was shot in each leg and an artery was hit. Through life savings measures, quick neighbor response, on site medical assistance on the part of responders, along with the wonderful surgeons and all medical staff at Phoenix Children’s Hospital, at this stage, he will live and keep both of his legs as a result of a miraculous artery rebuild using a vein out of the less damaged leg (as warrior angel will remain anonymous, due to his age).FOR MY PART: I willing and going to put up no less than $8k, all of my savings, towards a reward for information leading to the capture and conviction of these heartless young criminals who have shattered our community’s sense of safety and nearly took the life of a beloved young boy with nothing but a bright future ahead of him, if it is necessary. My ask is if we can raise enough, I can keep some of my savings, pledging no less than $4k to get this going but prepared to put up $8k if necessary.WHAT THIS GO FUND ME IS BEING USED FOR: These funds will go towards family trauma counseling for all family that need it and missed income while mom and dad spend their days and nights at his bedside during recovery.

She's married to Bob Britt and has two daughters, Hannah and Bonnie. She and Bob also have five grandchildren. Etta has been performing in Nashville most of her adult life, and has sung with countless artists over the years, as well as carried a career of her own in music. She has also been selling real estate in and around Nashville for over 20 years.Recently, Etta found a lump in her right breast. She made an appointment for a mammogram, despite just having had one last fall, and was sent for a biopsy, which came back positive for breast cancer. Unfortunately, the type of breast cancer she is facing is invasive triple negative breast cancer, which is aggressive and has fewer treatment options than other types. The general outline of her treatment plan is as follows, and is subject to change based on future findings:16 chemotherapy treatments over the course of 6 months, followed by a double mastectomy with reconstruction, possibly followed by radiation and/or more chemotherapy. This means many trips to Vanderbilt for imaging, procedures, infusions, appointments, etc. She will have a port placed under her collarbone to receive all of her infusions. She will lose her hair. She will undergo the greatest battle she has ever endured.Here is where we are asking for your help. We are setting a goal of $75,000 to help pay for the medical and living expenses for Etta's treatment and surgery. This sounds like a lofty goal, but to be honest, it may not even touch the final cost of everything.The pandemic has had a crippling economic effect on musicians. All of Bob's touring income has disappeared, and this is a process that will last over half a year.Etta has given so much of her own time to organize and perform benefits for other friends in need. Let's come together and do the same for her. Any monetary contribution that you are able to donate is beyond appreciated. Above all, please pray and continue to pray for Etta and her family. Pray for healing and pray for a peaceful and complete recovery from this cancer.Thanks for stopping by.Read more"

Her brother Craig died at a year old from liver cancer and her brother David died at age 17 from heart disease while playing basketball. Who would ever believe that tragedy would strike the Jones family again?In 2012, Lisa discovered a lump in her breast just two months after a negative mammogram. She was quickly diagnosed with stage 2B Breast Cancer. After surgery, and several rounds of chemotherapy, she thankfully rang the bell at Hershey Medical Center announcing that she was cured.While being treated for her cancer, Lisa acquired a love for running and completed numerous races with some of her biggest supporters as part of the Scranton running community. She ran numerous races in Scranton, Philly, Hershey, Virginia Beach and her biggest accomplishment, the New York City Marathon with Ryan’s Run 6! All being a testament to her strength and endurance.Lisa continued to live her life cancer free enjoying her home, her children, her job, her family and friends and her time in Long Beach Island.Lisa was not aware that the mental strength and endurance she was gaining through marathon training was actually preparing her for the struggle of her life. Two months after she ran the New York City Marathon in 2015, her cancer metastasized to her liver and she was diagnosed stage IV/end stage cancer. This was a crushing blow to Lisa, her family and her friends.This new diagnosis brought Lisa to The University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia where she has endured daunting chemo treatments, some of which had side effects that were extremely harsh to her body. Medical procedures became common place. Not one to complain, Lisa continued to work full time and take care of her home and family.Two years ago, Lisa was admitted to the University of Penn for an extremely life-threatening bile duct blockage due to her cancer. Her condition was critical and her family and friends feared that she would not make it home. Lisa’s strength astounded her doctors and it appeared that a miracle occurred as she fully recovered and returned to her teaching position where she has shaped the lives of hundreds of students over the last two decades.After her recovery from the bile duct illness, Lisa acquired malignant peritoneal ascites which requires weekly treatment that continues to this day.In November of 2018, Lisa was hospitalized with a nonsurgical bowel blockage which became a critical illness as she lay in a coma for four days in ICU. It was, indeed, another miracle that she survived and came home after a month in the hospital. Lisa was sent home in December with the unfortunate expectations that she would not survive more than a few weeks.As we put this Go Fund Me page together, Lisa is thriving and with the help of her family and friends and the miracle of medicine. She has regained much of her strength and is learning to deal with the effects of the disease. She requires daily assistance for medications, tube feedings and nursing care. Chemo options have been exhausted.Lisa is unable to work and is currently on a medical sabbatical. There currently are copays, uncovered medical expenses, and ambulance fees that are mounting daily. The expenses of daily living, raising 2 teenagers and maintaining a mortgage continue. Her Mom and Dad have placed their lives on hold to help Lisa and her girls meet their daily needs.Through all this, Lisa continues to spread awareness about Metastatic Breast Cancer. She, like Robin Roberts, is trying to make, ‘her mess her message’. She takes every opportunity to educate everyone about the realities of breast cancer. She is role model, not only to her girls but to her community and the world.She often ends her musings on her FB page, HOPE…#LisaStrong, with the following hashtags:#bethelight#stageivneedsmore#knowledgeispowerHer family and friends have rallied to support this warrior whom we love dearly!! Please consider making a contribution to this fund that will help defray expenses.

When he was 9, he was diagnosed with conversion disorder.Conversion disorder is a condition where the brain uses physical symptoms as a way to cope with distress or discomfort, challenging thoughts and emotions as well as psychological trauma. Some people become paralyzed, blind or deaf. Some lose the ability to speak or swallow. Some go unconscious and have non-epileptic seizures. This is what happens to Jordan. Usually when he goes unconscious, he is standing or walking. He falls to the ground and bangs his head.All these conditions have greatly limited and reduced his quality of life.These blackouts happen suddenly and without warning. Jordan has blacked out at school, while playing sports, during nature walks, at work, in our yard, in the pool, while standing on a chair putting dishes away, in his bed and in the bathtub. This summer while out on a fishing boat, he went unconscious and fell overboard while the boat was moving. He was found shortly after floating face first in the river. Luckily, he was rescued before drowning. He was wearing a life jacket.These blackouts over the last 10 years have resulted in an amount of concussions in the double digits, contusions, neck and back problems. Just to name a few:spinal stenosis in the lumbar regionspinal stenosis in the cervical regioncervical disc disorderintervertebral disc stenosisdisc stenosis of the neural canal in the lumbar regionArnold-Chiari Syndrome.Jordan blacked out at home on December 9,2020. The next day while recuperating in bed he started experiencing respiratory failure. His sister found him and called 911. His father had to perform chest compressions until the police, paramedic & ambulance arrived. He was rushed to the Anna Laberge Hospital. Upon examination he was diagnosed with a brain bleed in 2 areas. They immediately put him in a medically induced coma and rushed him to The Montreal General Hospital. There they discovered that his skull was fractured in 4 places.After emergency surgery, he remained in a coma for 7 days, to allow his brain to heal. He had 40 stitches and remained in the hospital for 3 weeks. He was then transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation center for 2more weeks of recovery.The neurosurgeon who saved Jordan’s life said that he will fall again because of his conversion disorder. He was right. Jordan passed out on January 15,2021 while at rehab, banged his head and was brought back by ambulance to The Montreal General Hospital where fortunately the doctors found no new brain injuries.Jordan also blacked out the other day at home, luckily only lightly hurting his shoulder.Since the brain surgery, he is experiencing many challenges. He is very weak and scared. He no longer hears out of his right ear and has permanent ringing in it. His balance is severely reduced. He experiences prolonged periods of fatigue.We have started this fundraiser, so Jordan can get the help, care, rehabilitation and anything else that he needs today and in the future. He requires medical care that is not covered by Medicare. Jordan is no longer able to attend school and cannot work. Jordan needs around the clock care. He can never be left alone because of the high risk of getting more severe head injuries. Only one parent can work because of his health conditions. Jordan requires sessions with a psychologist and a physiotherapist. He sees a private neurosurgeon specializing in neck and back injuries and receives injections to manage the pain in these areas. They also need to do special tests to determine the treatment that he needs, surgery being the last resort. Jordan is waiting to see a doctor in Boston who specializes in the treatment of conversion disorder. He also has a scheduled appointment with a psychologist in New York who specializes in conversion disorder. Unfortunately, we have not gotten any results in Montreal. In fact, resources in Canada are very few and far between for conversion disorder.As you can see the costs ahead for Jordan’s treatments will easily surpass $100K. Jordan’s health conditions are permanent. They will be with him for the rest of his life. Our goal is to be able to help ease the suffering he is experiencing and improve his quality of life. We will not be able to continue getting him the help he requires unless people come together and help Jordan.From the bottom of our hearts we humbly ask that you share this link with friends and family and if possible a donation (any amount will help). All money raised goes directly to Jordan’s care and rehabilitation.We thank you for your support and God bless each and every one of you.Go Fund Me requirement Update:Beneficiary for this campaign is Stephen King. Jordan King's father.All funds will be used for everything that Jordan needs and will need. This includes on going assessments, physiotherapy, treatments and anything else to improve his current situation.Thank you and God blessRead more"

Siz değerli yardım severleri hayata tutunmaya çalışan Öykü Semra’ya destek olmaya çağırıyorum. Kampanyamıza bağışta bulunarak ve duyurarak bize destek olabilirsiniz. Öykü Semra’nın hastane belgeleri ve Ailesinin mesajı aşağıdadır. !!!Wichtige Erklärung!!!Warum ich diese Kampagne organisiere?Tochter von meinem Freund ,,Öykü Semra Elmalica“ kämpft gegen lebensgefährliche Krankheit SMA Typ 1 (Spinale Muskelatrophie). Die ärztliche Bescheinigung steht anbei als ein Foto auf Türkisch. Die Familie leben in der Türkei und es ist nicht möglich, von der Türkei in GoFundMe oder in einer ähnlichen Plattform die Spendenaktion organisieren, weil die Türkei nicht von diesen Plattformen unterstützt wird. Außerdem haben die Familie in den Ländern, in den die diese Behandlung erlaubt ist, keine einzige Verwandte. Deshalb haben sie mich gebeten, ob ich diese Kampagne organisieren kann. Deshalb habe ich übernommen, die Kampagne zu organisieren.Einzige Möglichkeit für die Behandlung ist Gen-Therapie (Zolgensma). Zurzeit kostet die Behandlung 2.132.000 Euro. Die Spenden werden für die Behandlung von ,,Öykü Semra Elmalica“ ausgegeben. Da die Familie bzw. die spendenbegünstige Person es nicht auszahlen lassen kann, werde ich es an mich, Adem Keles, auszahlen lassen und an das Krankenhaus weiterüberweisen. Sobald ich die Spenden überweise, werde ich die Rechnung auf dieser Internetseite hochladen.!!!Önemli!!!! Neden bu kampanyayı ben üstlendimArkadaşımın kızı Öykü sma Typ 1 e karşı mücadele ediyor. Doktor raporu resim olarak eklidir. Aile Türkiye de yaşıyor ve Türkiye den bu kampanyayı başlatmak mümkün değil. Sebep: Türkiye bu GoFundMe ve benzer platformlar tarafından desteklenmiyor. Bu nedenle Semra nın ailesi bana kampanyayı organize etmemi rica etti ve bende kampanyayı üstlendim.Tedavi için tek yöntem Zolgensma gen tedavisi. Bu tedavi 2.132.000 Euro tutarındadır. Burda toplanan bağışlar bu Öykü'nün tedavisi için harcanacaktır.

Ve ölümcül bir kas hastalığı olan SMA (Spinal Musculer Atrofi) ile mücadele ediyor. Hastalığı 3,5 aylıkken öğrendiğimizde doktorun bize dediği şey; “ çocuğunuz muhtemelen 2 yaşını görmeden vefat edecek. Mevcut tedavi için bir dakika bile kaybetmeden işlemlerinizi yapın belki ilaçtan fayda görür. ”şeklindeydi. O günden bu yana zamanla çok büyük bir yarış içerisine girdik... Ülkemizde SMA hastalarına çeşitli şartlara bağlı olarak verilen ilacı, yoğun gayretlerimizle bu zamana kadar alabildik.. Ve ilaç sayesinde güzel gelişmeler de gördük. Yalnız her ilaç başvurusu, her ilaç uygulaması bizim için büyük bir travma oluyordu. Neden mi ? Çünkü başvuru aşamasında şartları sağlayacak mı enjekte aşamasında (omurilikten verildiği için yüksek risk var ) ilaç sorunsuz uygulanacak mı korkusu ; her uygulama öncesi bize ölümden daha beter bir duygu yaşatıyordu.. Ve 4 ayda bir biz bu duyguyu hep içimizde hissediyorduk. ArtıkArtık hayal kurmayı bırakıp bu duyguyla baş etmenin derdine düşmüştük... Hastalığı öğrendikten aylar sonra ilk defa bizlere büyük bir umut doğdu. İlaç dünyasında bir ilk yaşandı. Ve genetik bir hastalığın kökten çözümü olan gen terapisi (Zolgensma) dünyanın önde gelen sağlık örgütleri FDA ve EMA tarafından onaylandı. Bu ilaç bize çok büyük bir umut oldu. Çünkü Zolgensma hastalığın kökünde yatan SMN 1 geninin olmayışını bir virüs aracılığıyla ortadan kaldırmakta. Virüse SMN 1 geninin görevini yaptırarak kas harabiyetini durdurmakta. Ve de en önemlisi hayat boyunca sadece bir kez, damar yoluyla uygulanmakta. İlacın tek olumsuz tarafı var ki o da dünyanın en pahalı ilacı olması. Tedavi için aldığımız teklif şuan 2.132.000 Euro. Ve ilacın bir diğer özelliği hasta ilaca ne kadar erken ulaşırsa ilaçtan o kadar etkili bir sonuç alınabilmesi. YaniYani hastalığı öğrendiğimiz ilk andan itibaren yaşamaya başladığımız, zamanla yarışımızda şuan en üst kulvardayız... Zaman değil biz kazanmalıyız... Bu aşamada tek gayemiz ; tek başımıza bir araya getiremeyeceğimiz bu yüksek miktarı desteklerinizle bir an önce toplayabilmek ve Öykünün hayat kalitesine katkıda bulunabilmek... Öykü’nün ailesi olarak sizlere; Umudun Öyküsünü hep birlikte yazalım diyorum... Lütfen sesimize ses, Öykü'müze nefes olun... English Hi everyone, Our daughter is only 21 months old suffering from SMA (spinal muscular atrophy), a terminal muscular disease. She was 3,5 months old when we learnt about the disease. Then the doctor said to us that our child would have died by the age of 2. We were told to take an immediate action in the hope that she could have a chance of reaping the benefits of medicine. Since then, we have raced against time… We have so far managed to receive the medicine given to SMA patients under certain conditions…And we have witnessed considerable recovery thanks to the medicine. However, every application procedure for medicine turned into a trauma for us. We were very concerned about fulfilling the provisions for receiving the medicine and had the fear during the implementation since it was administered through spinal cord. Prior to every administration, we had a feeling worse than death. And we were full of this feeling every four months. Let alone dreaming, we worried a lot about how to cope with this feeling. A great hope was born for us months after we learnt about the disease. That was a first in the world of medicine that gene therapy (zolgensma) was approved by the leading health institutions FdA and Ema. This medicine was a great hope for us because zolgensma could remove, by means of a virus, the underlying absence of smn1 attributed to the disease. Running as the function of smn1 gene, the virus can stop muscular temperature. Above all, this procedure is administered only once throughout life. The only disadvantage of the medicine is that it is the most expensive medicine in the world. The offer we have got for treatment is now 2.132.000 Euro. It is said that the earlier we receive the medicine, the more effective result we get. We are now on a high track in the race we have waged with time so far. It is not the time but we who should win. Our only goal at this point is to be able to collect this large amount of money with your supports and contribute to improvement in Öykü`s life quality. We, as family of Öykü, are calling out to you to write the story of hope together. Please, be our voice and breathe to our Öykü. Deutsche Hallo an alle , unsere Tochter Öykü ist noch 21 monat ve trotzdem muss sie nun mit einer lebensgefährlichen Krankheit SMA (Spinale Muskelatrophie) kämpfen. Als wir erstmals über ihre Krankheit informiert wurden, sagte der Arzt: „Euer Kind wird sterben, wahrscheinlich bevor sie 2 Jahre alt wird. Für die vorhandene Behandlung müsst ihr ohne Zeit zu verlieren reagieren. Jede Minute, hier eine wichtige Rolle spielt. Vielleicht kann sie durch die Medikamente etwas Fortschritt zeigen. “ Seit diesem Moment sind wir in einem großen Wettkampf mit der Zeit. Bis jetzt konnten wir mit kontinuierlichen Bemühungen schaffen, die Medikamente, die für SMA Kranken nur bestimmten Voraussetzungen gegeben werden, zu kaufen. Dadurch bezeugten wir auch Fortschritte. Jedes Einnehmen Medikamente führte zu einem Trauma. Warum? Im Meldungsprozess hatten wir Angst und Sorge davor, ob unsere Tochter und ihr Körper die bestimmte Voraussetzungen bereitstellt, ob das Medikament während der Injektion problemlos angewendet werden kann. Es hat jedes Mal Lebensgefahr, Rückenmark eingespritzt werden muss. Deswegen hatten wir jedes Mal ein Gefühl, dass schlimmer als der Tod ist. 4 Monaten lang erlebten wir immer Gefühle. Wir verzichteten auf unseren hoffnungsvollen Träumen und gewöhnten es mit diesem Gefühl zu leben. Nach Monaten der Kenntnis über die Krankheit unserer Tochter, Hoffnung für uns. Zum ersten Mal wurde die Gen-Therapie (Zolgensma), die eine Lösung für genetische Krankheiten ist, von prominenten Weltgesundheitsorganisationen bestätigt. Dieses Medikament bereitete uns eine große Hoffnung. Denn Zolgensma beseitigt den Wurzeln der Krankheit durch ein Virus. Der Wurzel Krankheit ist die Abwesenheit von smn1-Gen ist. Die Funktion von smn1-Gen wird durch Virus erledigt und die Muskeln des Körpers können wieder aufgebaut werden bzw. Zerstörung der Aufbau von Muskeln gestoppt werden. Und das Wichtigste ist, dass es nur einmal im Leben durch die Vene eingespritzt werden kann. Dieses Medikament nur ein Nachteil: es ist das teuerste Medikament der Welt. Zurzeit kostet es 2.132.000 Euro Eine andere Eigenschaft des Medikaments ist; je früher der Kranke Medikament einnehmen kann, desto wirksamer kann das Ergebnis werden. Es heißt, dass wir in der letzten Etappe, unserem Wettkampf mit der Zeit sind. Nicht die Zeit, sondern wir müssen gewinnen ... Dieser Etappe ist unser einziger Zweck; diese Geldmenge, die wir nie allein verschaffen können, zusammen zu sammeln ve Beitrag für die Leben Genesung von Öykü zu leisten Als Öyküs Eltern sagen euch; ""Öykü"" Geschichte. Es kann vielleicht eine Geschichte der Hoffnung sein und wir wollen sie mit Ihnen zusammen schreiben. Bitte unterstützen Sie uns, seien Sie ein Atem für unsere ÖyküFrançais Salut à tous!

He was rushed to the CBRH ICU in Sydney where he stayed for two nights until stable enough to be brought to Halifax by Medevac. Open heart surgery was performed within 24 hours of his arrival. He’s not out of the woods yet, but he’s since been gradually taking steps in the right direction. He has been looked after by the very best, and the family wants to extend enormous thanks to all the nurses, paramedics, and doctors that have been providing top-notch care and updates.This has been a shock and a very difficult time for his family, his partner in love and music Gillian, and his friends. We all know Jason for his big heart and bear hugs; we just didn’t know his heart came with a leaky valve. All the positive vibes have kept us going, and for these, we can’t thank you enough. At this difficult time, we appreciate the messages of support and appreciate you leaving them here on the site or by email at[email redacted].Jason has never been one to ask for help, but the offers for fundraising concerts, food, drives/pick-ups, and monetary contributions have been so appreciated in many ways. With current safety protocols, it feels that this GoFundMe page (which is directed to a new account created at the Cheticamp Credit Union for Jason and Gillian) is the safest and most effective way to offer support for now. Funds raised will go directly towards medication and living expenses for Jason and Gillian, and we may look at doing further musical fundraising initiatives in the near future. Thank you in advance for your contributions and shares, and we'll provide updates through this page.For those of you that don’t know Jason - besides being one of the most talented and sweet fellas on the go - he has a wide range of interests fromfolk art, rocks, life hacks, and anything otherworldly. If you want to send support in another form that he'd approve of, feel free to share some off-the-wall folk art, an article about petrology, a lifehack, a good ghost story, a UFO sighting or any otherworldly occurrence meaningful to you, and hashtag it #forjay #unidentifiedfriendlyoffering and your pick from these: #folkart #rocksrock #reallifelifehack #talesfromtheotherside .That’s Jay, and it would mean a lot to him and us.

It's been a tough year for creators of music, art, video, books etc. Normally I accept it for what it is - an extremely risky existence with lots of hustle, more hours than I know how to log (I am never off-the-clock) and tons of disappointments and rejections between the successes that make it mostly worth doing again for the next project.I particularly love trying to inspire other guitar players to be their best, so I spend a lot of time providing free advice and answering comments and messages about all things guitar-related. Guitar players are the second coolest people (cats being the first).

Life as a creative person is not, never will be, and was never meant to be easy. I've worked plenty of ""regular jobs"" over the years from retail, deliveries to teaching. I work harder now than I ever did in those jobs for fewer rewards but greater satisfaction (on the good days).

Not only do I accept the nature of this beast and how it operates, I quite often enjoy the thrill of the chase and the amount of work it takes to make a project awesome and successful. It's a rollercoaster of ups and downs.Here's the thing: The ups haven't been there lately, and it's taken a toll on me.Unfortunately, the creative spirit is often interlocked with the black dog of depression, as my adult life and the last few years, in particular, can attest to.2019 has been an extremely rough one, beginning with a complete emotional breakdown, and finishing where I am now - having some trouble getting through the rest of the year due to a decline in income and productivity and basically just bad economic conditions for earning money from creative works.I've had about 15 days off this year, but pretty much every other day, you'll find me up at 7am and working until 9pm, creating free content to educate the guitar community and also the things I depend on my livelihood for like books and video products. It's brought me close to another breakdown, but I'm trying to hang in there.As hard as it was to admit my broken state and bear my weaknesses, I recently came clean with my followers about my struggles and why I've been a bit of a ghost lately. I'm not very good at asking for help and I'm even worse at accepting it, but a number of people have asked me to start something on this platform so they can give back a little, and I figure this is a transparent way to do it. I tried sourcing a grant from a music-related organisation in Australia but the experience was so judgmental and demoralizing that I couldn't pursue it.I have no expectations of what will come. I just wanted to give those people in a position to help a way to do so. As I said, I'm terrible at accepting kindness but I need to overcome that if I'm to heal and become stronger.So, IF and only IF you felt like contributing to my wellbeing for a little while until I finish off some projects and attend to my depression recovery at the same time, I'd welcome the opportunity to breathe a little without feeling that weight of financial hardship in my stomach.Please don't give me anything if you're doing it tough. My heart is with you if you've had a rough year too.The next 6-7 weeks are really the pressure points for me. Hopefully, things will take a natural upswing coming into Christmas. I don't know but I'm hopeful.I apologise for the abundance of words when really I just need two: Thank you.Chris Brooks

Our good friend John Paul Shellnut (aka JP) suffered a stroke on August 29th and he has been in a Houston hospital ever since. Although he recently has been able to lift his left leg 6 inches, most of his left side is paralyzed (temporarily we pray). However, JP still has his positive outlook and infectious charm. Any amount you can contribute will help offset some of the expenses and lost income and help toward his medical costs and recovery until he can work again. $1, $10, $100, $1,000, $10,000…every bit will help! So please consider donating today so we can get JP back in action. You can learn more about JP in the “About JP” section below and THANK YOU in advance for your generous support!As many of us know, life comes at hard and fast! So, in spite of JP’s relationships and past successes he was unprepared to handle the huge financial burden he now faces. Given the global pandemic and the fact business in LA has ground to a halt, JP has been out of work for the last six months and now won’t be able to work for the next 12-24 months! Plus, insurance will only pay a portion (or none) of his future medical expenses (i.e., housing, assisted living/24-hour care, rehab, physical therapy, co-pays, deductibles, etc.). Some of JP’s friends are not only helping him financially but also are adding the following enticements for all of you ZZ Top fans, WWE Fans and fans of fine tequila. Billy Gibbons has agreed to give a personalized autographed photograph to the first 50 donors who donate $100 or more. To the 10 largest ZZ Top fan donors who contribute by 10/31/20, Billy will give you a personalized autographed Billy F. Gibbons: Rock + Roll Gearhead book. WWE afficionado, executive director of SmackDown and Raw and Something To Wrestle podcaster Bruce Prichard has agreed to give personalized autographed photographs to the fist 100 donors who donate $100 or more, and the first 50 people to donate $500 or more will receive a phone call and get to chat with Bruce himself. Stewart Skloss, CEO of Pura Vida Tequila and Frontier Spirits will donate a tequila tasting event for you and 19 of your friends at your home for a donation of $1000 or more. Note the tequila and a 1 hour tasting session by Stewart himself is provided, food and other beverages are not. Event is subject to mutually agreeable dates and location (i.e. Texas is easy, the rest of the country is more difficult but best efforts will be made to accommodate your request). Super Important Note- If you wish to participate in any of the above swag, please designate which item you prefer (i.e., Gibbons book, Prichard call, etc.). Look for “Finished sharing? Continue” at the bottom of the page after you donate and click on the Continue hotlink. In the “I donated because…” section DESIGNATE WHICH ITEM YOU PREFER, then click “Post Comment.” ABOUT JP- JP is a near and dear friend to many people across the country. Originally from Americus, Georgia, his southern charm, energy and outgoing personality made him fast friends with a diverse set of amazing people...from rock stars, movie stars, businessmen and women, WWE superstars, janitors, bellmen and everyone in between! In short, “everyone” knows JP and many consider him to be THEIR best friend! JP was a wide receiver in college and made his way to Texas after leaving college. Starting out his career in the automotive industry, he quickly began using his golden Rolodex and charm to create his own lucrative niche of helping new car dealers trade and balance their inventories. His ability to connect with people as well as connect people together eventually lead him to Hollywood where he has acted and helped put various business deals together...all while having a great time and making friends along the way!Important Note- If you wish to participate in any of the above swag, please designate which item you prefer, as stated above. Only one item per donation…in other words, a $100 donation will allow you to choose between the Gibbons or Prichard personalized autographed photo but not both.

The HistoryOur parents, Angela and David, compelled by their love for Jesus, are some of the most generous and compassionate people. They are missionaries to missionaries. Our family home, a safe haven of love, was like a train station growing up and still is. They’ve opened their home to friends and strangers alike. Whether a friend (or friend of a friend) needed a place to stay, a cuppa tea, a chat or a shoulder to lean on, our parents have always been there, active and loving members of their community. They have supported countless people even when it was inconvenient to do so.

The SituationOur father needs critical heart surgery in March this year.A couple years ago, dad got a fairly severe yet routine cold while visiting William, our brother, in Columbus. The infection persisted for weeks and then attacked his heart, causing damage resulting in what is known as severe constrictive pericarditis, a heart condition which could result in heart failure.Constrictive pericarditis is a chronic inflammation of the pericardium, the sac-like membrane that surrounds the heart. Inflammation in this part of the heart causes scarring, thickening, and muscle tightening. Left untreated, a rigid heart muscle can lead to heart failure as the heart is no longer flexible and can no longer stretch as much as it should when it beats.Fortunately, dad has been fit and healthy for decades with a balanced nutritious diet and regular exercise. The doctors are astounded by how well he is coping under this heart condition, however, he has been told that he needs to have open heart surgery as soon as possible.The FiguresAs we all know medical costs can add up significantly and given the severity of this surgery and the complications that can arise, the costs could be even higher. While they have been able to secure some help covering these costs, there is still a significant amount that we are hoping to raise to supplement these medical expenses. There are also additional non-medical expenses such as the travel for our parents between their home base in Dar es Salaam Tanzania and South Africa for the operation and post op recovery and check ups.We are sharing this with you because we need your help. If you can make a financial donation to help our dad, we will forever be grateful. If you cannot donate, please send your thoughts and prayers to my parents and share this with your friends and circles. Every little bit helps.Please help us help our dad.

Thanks and God Bless.

The second rupture in less than 2 years. Luckily, Jason's very good friend/employer, Roger Byrd, went to his apartment when Jason did not show up for work. Jason was unconcious and paramedics were called. He was taken to the hospital where he was intubated. Also an EVD was placed. This allows blood and CSF to drain to relieve building pressure in the brain. Jason was quickly transferred to UAB Hospital. An AVM is a tangle of abnormal blood vessels connecting arteries and veins in the brain. AVM's are very rare and most people are born with them. Jason recovered very well from his first rupture, butthis rupture is much worse. He was comatose for the first several days and his left side was not responding at all. The AVM is located in his brainstem, which makes it inoperable. On the third day after his stroke, Jason extubated himself (he pulled out his vent!). He started whispering immediately afterwards, which is amazing. He recognizes people and his sense of humor is still there! Right now he is fighting the effects of ""neurostorming"", which causes him to spike a very high fever, his oxygen levels to drop, and to breath more rapidly. We, his family, are overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and prayers. We are so grateful for all of you. Jason's cycling family means so much to him. The neurosurgeon told Jason's mom and dad that Jason faces a long road to recovering, to what extent he does not know but he feels hopeful due to his age and physical condition. We are concerned about the financial burden this will be to Jason. He will go to a step down unit when he leaves ICU and then to rehab. As most of you know, Jason has a beautiful 10 year old daughter, Mia.For those of you that don't know Jason personally, he is a unique young man; so kind and giving. He is a wonderful father to Mia and they have so much fun together. Jason plays a huge role in the cycling community. He leads rides through Birmingham and always welcomes newcomers, even taking the time to ride with them and help them love the sport as he does. We don't know how long it will be before Jason can work again or the effects of the financial burden of his medical expenses, which are already significant. If you can donate any amount of money it will be greatly appreciated. If you can't donate we understand, but would love for you to visit Jason. I will continue to post updates of Jason's recovery process. We want to thank each and everyone of you for your continued love and prayers.Marie Yester Eidson (Aunt)Read more"

UPDATE 2/17/21A huge thank you to all whom have prayed, called, texted and generously donated. We are so happy to be able to update the page with good news! Andrew is recovering at home and gaining more strength each day. We are so grateful to have him home :) Thankfully, his clot did not require surgery. The doctors have switched his medication and are carefully watching him to avoid any further complications with clotting. Even on positive and brighter days, thoughts and prayers are always welcomed. We are looking forward to the next few weeks, as he continues to recover and his birthday approaches on March 4th. Stay tuned for a wishlist if you would like to send him a little something to celebrate with him from afar! Sending lots of love to you all. Thank you again for all of your generous support. XO

UPDATE 1/31/21We are asking for prayers and support as Andrew and his family await answers after he was admitted to the hospital for a blood clot in his arm on Friday. We are in admiration of his continuedstrength - physically, mentally and emotionally. He is an inspiration to us. He remains positive and in good spirits, despite the pain and tightness at the site of the clot andlimited range of motion. We are awaiting the results of the blood cultures to rule out any underlying infection, as well as a possible surgery to remove theclot entirely, depending upon the results and how the next few days go.For now, he is on a medication via IV to aid in the reduction of swelling, which hopefully will help mitigate his pain. We are beyond thankful for the care team he has at UCSD. As always, we cannot thank you enough for taking the time to read/share the updates, for your continued generous donations and your prayers and love.

UPDATE 12/22/20It's been a while and we wanted to let you know what's going on with Andrew. Overall, his recovery post-transplant has gone well. Blood counts continue to normalize and he is regularly monitored and testedtomake sure he is on the right path.However, over the past several weeks, Andrew has been experiencing pain in his knees along with most recently, swelling in his legs and ankles. After 2 ER visits this week and various scans, a blood clot was detected in his left leg. Thankfully it was caught at this stage!! Andrew has been admitted to the hospital to administer IV blood thinners along with tests and scans to determine if there are any more clots. So far, it is just the one. The hope is that he will be discharged by Christmas.Andrew wants you to know how incredibly grateful he is for your kindness, prayers, and financial support. You really showed up for him during this challenging time and it will never be forgotten.Some of you have expressed ways to help aside from financial contributions (which continue to be vital at this time). Andrew is putting together a wish list of items and we will post these soon. In the meantime, may you and yours be blessed during this holiday season. May LOVE, HOPE, PEACE, JOY, and HEALING reign over all of us as we complete 2020.UPDATE 10/23/2020GOOD NEWS! Andrew’s transplant was successful and he was discharged from the hospital in September!!! We delayed sharing this report in order to give his family time to quietly settle in to their new normal.While we celebrate the good news on this front, Andrew and family are met with the new challenges of recovery. Since his immune system is compromised, he has to stay in his apartment and only eat home-cooked meals for 100 days post transplant. He also continues to visit the clinic several times a week for blood work and follow up treatments.At this time, Sue and Sarah are Andrew’s caregivers; cooking, cleaning, running errands, and providing emotional support.They still need our prayers and financial support during this time, as there are many expenses associated with this newest chapter in the journey.Thank you again to all who have so generously contributed.Stay tuned for more updates to follow.UPDATE 9/3/2020It was confirmed that Andrew has Graft vs. Host Disease in his stomach. Thankfully, he wasalreadyon steroids before the diagnosis. Also, he is eating a little bit better, for which we are very grateful. Thank you for your healing prayers.UPDATE 8/30/2020Andrew is still experiencing the ups and down in his recovery journey. We are grateful that his vitals are stable and he hasn’t had a fever in the last few days.The issues at hand are a fungal infection in his respiratory system, for which he is receiving IV antifungal meds. He is also being tested for Graft vs. Host, which is a potential side effect from any kind of organ/blood transplantation. Basically, the transplant recipient’s immune system tries to attack the donor’s new cells as a foreign body. There are special medications to minimize these effects, but it takes some trial and error to get it balanced. Also, due to chemo treatments, Andrew’s taste buds have changed, so eating is more challenging.Overall, he is still in the healing process and we are standing by his side as his allies. While we are getting closer to the financial goal (thanks to all of you who have contributed), we still have a ways to go. If you haven’t given yet, or would like to donate again, please help us reach this financial goal so that Andrew is taken care of with lodging and care throughout his recovery time.A HUGE THANK YOU!!!UPDATE 8/23/2020The journey continues to unfold. Andrew still has some of the side effects mentioned in previous updates, but slowly things are turning around. The engraftment is going very well so far, for which we are all grateful. Please pray for mental and physical strength, as it is challenging to be in this unfamiliar territory. This truly is part of every Hero's Journey. Andrew and the Bulicek Family continue to be blessed by your loving and generous support in every way. Thank you!!!!UPDATE 8/19/2020Andrew is on the Recovery Rollercoaster. He was moved out of ICU and back to the transplant floor. Then in the middle of the night, he was transferred to another area for suspicions of Covid. Thankfully he tested negative. He continues to have some pain in his feet and chest, along with a flareup of mucositis; side-effects from the treatments.However, there is good news. The engraftment is going very well, for which we are all grateful.UPDATE 8/17/2020Andrew is doing better in some ways and struggling in others. He still has pain in his feet and a sharp pain in his chest. The medical team is continuing to adjust meds to get the painundercontrol. The graft is taking well and if all continues to improve, he could be discharged in a week or so.UPDATE 8/16/2020Andrew's fever has come down and his vitals are normalizing, including oxygen levels. The current nasty side effects are neuropathy in his feet, for which the medical team is trying to find the best pain management, and mucositis which makes it very difficult to talk orswallow.GOOD NEWS has arrived. The engraftment from the donor cells has been detected in Andrew's blood. This came 2 days sooner than expected!!! These painful side effects should begin to lessen as the new stem cells take up residence in his body. Thank you for yourkindness and prayers.UPDATE 8/14/2020  URGENT!!!!Andrew was admitted to ICU during the middle of the night, exhibiting low blood pressure, an elevated heart rate, and high fever. The doctors have confirmed he has pneumonia from the extreme mucositis, as saliva got into his lungs and caused infection. He is on heavy antibiotics and is expected to get better within 24 hours or so, although his symptoms may worsen initially. While Andrew has had no family allowed to visit him during the transplant (due to Covid), gratefully they have made an exception for Sue to be with him today and Sarah to be with him tomorrow. Thank you for your prayers and love.UPDATE 8/13/2020Today is Day 9 post-transplant. So far, everything is on track!!! Currently, Andrew is experiencing the expected side-effects of having zero blood counts. Besides fatigue, he has mucositis, which makes it extremely painful to talk or even swallow saliva. He is beingtreated for the pain and it should resolveover the weekend when the new cells begin to graft and his blood counts begin to rise. Please pray for his speedy recovery through this phase.Sue and Sarah are on the hunt for an apartment where Andrew can convalesce and be cared for once he is released from the hospital (which could be as early as Aug. 22nd!) Thanks to the generous donations, they will be able to cover some of these expenses.Although the physical challenges are great in this moment, Andrew is in good spirits and very optimistic about his full recovery. Thanks to all you have donated and prayed for Andrew. The Bulicek family are incredibly grateful.UPDATE 8/6/2020Andrew received the transplant on August 4th and it went very well. Now, his blood counts will fluctuate over the next few weeks. Please keep him in your prayers as he recovers. Thank you so much!UPDATE 8/1/2020Andrew was admitted to UCSD to beginpreparation for his transplant which is scheduled totake place on Tuesday, August 4th. He is strong and in great spirits. Thank you for your donations and prayers. It means so much to the Bulicek family.ANDREW'S STORY“Never in a million years, did we think that Andrew would get cancer too.”20 years ago, Andrew Bulicek was a dear childhood friend with Aria Lams who was navigating her Hero’s Journey with Leukemia. Andrew and the Bulicek family were incredible Allies of the Lams Family during the years of chemo treatments, 2 bone marrow transplants, and her heartbreaking and untimely death at age 10 1/2 .                                            Aria & Andrew 2002Today, Andrew is going through his own Hero’s Journey with cancer. He was diagnosed with Lymphoma in January 2019 and was successfully brought into remission through his care at UCSD. However, a secondary cancer was recently detected. So far, he has responded to this new round of chemo, but that is not enough.This time he will need a stem cell transplant. Unfortunately, his three siblings were not a donor match, so a recent search in the donor bank resulted in a perfect match from a young gentleman in Germany.The transplant has now been scheduled to begin at the end of July. Andrew will be admitted and receive a chemo ablation regimen in order to prepare his body to receive these life saving stem cells. Then he will have an inpatient recovery period where he will be carefully monitored as the cells eventually graft into his body. This could be anywhere from 5-6 weeks.Andrew's Alliesare stepping up to support him as he navigates these challenging times.Since Andrew will be hospitalized for an extended period, he will continue to miss work and income. Once his treatment is completed, he will need to find a new place to live where his mom (Sue) and sister (Sarah) will take on the role as 24/7 primary caretakers. The post-transplant recovery period is estimated to be 100 days or more.How you can help:1. Pray for Andrew’s complete healing.2. Contribute to this campaign to support Andrew’s expenses3.

Just because the goal, I initially set was reached, I underestimated the amount of help needed. So I ask, Please continue to Share my Grandma's Story and Please continue to Donate to her. Much Love, Tyson
On Christmas day 2020, Great Grandma's house caught fire and burned up. An extension cord malfunctioned, caught fire inside the garage and caught the rest of the house on fire.Luckily, she was sitting at the dinner table with her 2 sons, Roger and Jim. They heard a noise at the door leading to the garage. When Roger opened the door, he was met with a fierce raging fire, already too out of control to contain! All 3 of them raced out of the front door with the dog but left everything else behind...Luckily all 3, the dog and cat that lived in the garage, made it out safely before the inside of the house was over taken by flames.By the time the Fire Department arrived, it was too late to save the house. The flames engulfed much of the atticand spread throughoutthe house too quickly. The Firefighters did what they could do to extinguishthe flames but the damage to everything inside was extensive. If the flames did not burn it, the smoke did or the water to extinguishit did...Once theFire Marshall deemed it safe to go back inside, that is when the pictures you see, were taken by family members.Great Grandma is almost 86 years old with 9 grand kids and 7 great grand kids. She has already survived 3+ weeks in the hospital in September battling covid-19 and pneumonia but after a few months has almost made a complete recovery!I am asking for something to lift her spirits, to buy food for her dog, cat and herself. And whatever else she could think of that she needs.Even after all that Great Grandma has been through in life, if you asked her if she needs anything, Great Grandma will always tell you no. She always gives her grandkids and great grandkids birthday cards or money for Christmas and never asks for anything in return....As her grandson writing this, to whomever may be reading this, I reach out to you for a small donation to reach my goal of 2,000. She is an inspiration to me and that is why I want to show her the world still has a little good left in it.Much Love,TysonDonations also being accepted through paypal,https://paypal.me/pools/c/115184537481717545

My official diagnosis and treatment plan were given to me the same day Governor Cuomo shut the city down. I went through 18 weeks of chemo, but there were still some cancer cells that just didn’t go away. The doctor hoped that the residual chemo in my body would do the trick. Unfortunately, I have a very aggressive lymphoma and it started to grow back. So here we go again. I first needed to have surgery to get a biopsy. The tumors are in my pelvis, next to my spine, and difficult to reach with a needle. This was to double check that it is in fact still lymphoma. And it is. The new treatment is a more aggressive chemo, and then a stem cell transplant. I’m halfway through these rounds of chemo. This time it’s for 6 weeks. I met with my transplant doctor and NP last week. It's all very overwhelming. There's a lot that has to happen before the transplant. Tests, injections, various medicines, I have to get an oral exam, a PET scan, and then they can start harvesting my stem cells. If everything goes well that should happen the first week of January. I will then be admitted to the hospital towards the end of January for 3-4 weeks. The first 6 days they will be giving me a crazy strong chemo to kill off all my bone marrow and white blood cells. I will then get my stem cells transplanted back into me. It sounds like a science fiction story. The first 10 days I am told I will mostly just be bored. Then I'm not going to feel so good. My white blood cells will go down to zero, and then slowly go back up. As of right now, due to covid, I will be allowed 1 designated visitor. They can visit for 4 hours a day. Because of Everett’s job, it makes most sense for that person to be my sister, Rebecca. I am very lucky that she is able to come and be with me. She is looking into getting an Airbnb near the hospital. There is a possibility that this policy will change depending if the virus keeps getting worse. Or hopefully better. The recovery afterwards takes approximately 6 months. They gave me a book with all the dos and don’ts. There are a lot of don’ts. We are still processing it all. The good news is that everyone is already wearing masks and washing their hands. So that part is covered. Many of you keep on asking what you can do. Thank you so much. With the stem cell transplant, the types of gifts I can receive during and for at least six months afterwards is extremely limited. My diet will be very restrictive, and I can't have any flowers or plants. And no visitors at least while I'm in the hospital. With Covid, who knows what will happen afterwards. To limit my sister’s exposure to Covid, Rebecca has decided to stay near the hospital. I will be at NYU Langone in Manhattan. What would help us during this time is if you could contribute to her stay, plus some other things I will need to make my hospital stay and recovery more comfortable. If you feel compelled to give a gift, please consider contributing to this fund instead. Anything we don’t use will then be donated to cancer research.Alternatively, if this feels awkward (it feels awkward to ask, especially with so many people in need right now), please give to your preferred charity with what you would spend on a gift for me. Thank you so much for all the support these past 9 months. You all give me so much strength. Love, SarahRead more"

He had suffered a few medical incidents throughout the winter, including a serious head injury in April. His mom and sister (pictured below) and old friends flew out to look after him.After 31 days on the ventilator while the medical team at Mount Sinai worked on him, he was able to breathe on his own again. After another month, he was strong enough to begin physical therapy rehab to rebuild his muscle strength. The doctors called his recovery a miracle.CJ is now doing physical and occupational therapy as he learns to walk and do daily tasks again. It's a challenge but his spirits are high and he still has his signature CJ sense of humor intact.It's going to be a long road to recovery for CJ, and we're not sure how long it will be until he will be able to live independently or work again. But he is determined to make the best of his second chance. He eventually plans to move back to Grand Junction, Colorado to live with his sister while he heals.CJ is my roommate (and chosen family) and I am raising money to help him with his hospital bills and help him out while he recovers. While CJ was able to get on emergency Medicaid while in the hospital, he already had significant bills from his previous visits while he was uninsured, and the costs for a three-month plus stay in the hospital are still astronomical. Since we're not sure how long it will be before he will be back to work, I'm also raising money to help him get back on his feet.

Now, Danny is in a battle against COVID himself. On Saturday 1/16/2021 Danny was put on a ventilator to give his body the rest and oxygen it needs to continue battling the virus. On Tuesday 1/19/2021, we were informed intubation was not providing enough support for his body. The process has been initiated for him to be able to undergo ECMO, a process where the blood will be pumped outside of the body to receive oxygen and be circulated, thereby giving his heart and lungs a break and the opportunity to heal. Danny is a father of two children; those of us who know him know there is nothing in this world Danny loves more than his kids, Danny Jr and Unique. Danny is a devoted father, a good man and a great nurse. This campaign was created in an effort to ensure that his children are provided for and help alleviate the stress of a very long recovery process. As he fights for his life, let us come together and help him fight. Help us show him and his family that we have his back, just as he has always had ours. No amount is too small and anything helps during this difficult time for the family. Thank you so much for your contribution and please continue to pray and keep Danny and his family in your thoughts. All proceeds will go to his family!Read more"

My name is Jake, I'm a 5 1/2 year old ESA certified black lab and on January 11th I was diagnosed with cancer. After my owner, Kate noticed I was having difficulty breathing the vet found a large tumor in my chest. In my defense I was just trying to grow a second heart because I have so much love to give.  The good news is that after Kate took me to a doggy oncologist this tumor is operable! and with my age there is a good prognosis of recovery! The bad news is the estimated vet bill for a CT scan (required), lobectomy, sending a sample to pathology and recovery is $11,931. I have been with Kate since she rescued me from a shelter in 2017 and certified me to be an emotional support animal. My owner has worked hard to overcome PTSD and I don't want to brag but I know I have been a huge help to my human, keeping her active, happy and keeping her company though the good times and hard times. Last summer Kate and I drove all the way from Oregon to New York because Kate is going to Physician Assistant School.  Kate's exposure to healthcare left her with a profound appreciation for those that provide healing to patients and she knew she had to pay it forward. Now enrolled in Stony Brook's PA class of 2022, Kate primarily relies on loans and financial aid to make ends meet...and my tumor was not in the budget. I am so thankful my owner is choosing to fight for me and get the care I need. Please consider joining Kate in this journey and fund Jake's fight against cancer! At this time it's not known if I will need chemotherapy after surgery. Kate tells me the surgeon will send off a biopsy.

The good news is there's a tangible way for all of us to contribute to his recovery! For as serious of a condition as this is, there are treatment options available, and Patrick intends to do everything he can to fight this disease - and win!His medical team is working with him to form a treatment plan, but while Patrick has health insurance, there are many expenses that are going to be out-of-pocket. He's on a specialized diet that includes lots of juicing, and is looking into the possibility of alternative forms of medicine (including IV Vitamin C and cannabis oil), as well as the possibility of traveling internationally to centers with a broader range of treatment options than are currently allowed in the United States.If you've ever met Patrick, then you already know that he's one of the most generous people you could ever hope to meet. He's a man who gives of himself to anyone and everyone he knows, whether they're one of his students, a fellow filmmaker, or just a friend in need. His work through the Film Acting Academy of Denver, The Bug Theatre, and The Emerging Filmmakers Project has helped shaped the minds and careers of hundreds. He's a dedicated stay-at-home father to his sons Elliot and Finnegan, a teacher and mentor to many, and a friend to all of us. There's simply no way to calculate the number of lives that have been impacted for the better simply by having him in it.Patrick can beat this, but he can't do it alone.

Hello!

My name is Emma Moxon mum of Charlotte Moxon.On Saturday we presented to the Queensland Children’s Hospital due to a persistent cough which has lingered for 3 weeks.

Charlotte presented extremely well but as a precaution they decided to do an X-ray. This X-ray showed an enlarged heart. Charlotte then had an ultrasound and an echo and I was given the heartbreaking news that our little girl had something very wrong with her heart.

To say we were shocked would be an understatement. We came to hospital for a cough only to find out she has heart failure.

We met with the cardiologist Saturday night and she explained what she thought Charlotte had - a condition called ALCAPA. we were then moved to the cardiology ward where we were told we would stay indefinitely until we found out what was wrong.

Yesterday we met with Dr Lauren one of the senior cardiologists. She explained what they thought it was and what the plan of attack was. Charlotte had a CT scan yesterday and about an hour after we had a call from the doctor confirming it is definitely ALCAPA. She said open heart surgery will be required on Tuesday the 16th.

Today Charlotte will undergo lots of tests and scans in preparation for surgery tomorrow.

The doctors have said her getting sick was a blessing in disguise. If she hadn’t of gotten sick and they hadn’t of done the X-ray we might not have found out until it was too late.

This condition if not treated prior to 1 is often fatal.

ALCAPA is extremely rare and affects 1 in 300,000 babies. That’s 2-3 every 2 years in Australia.

The symptoms are very similar to that of othercompletely innocent baby problems such as colic. The symptoms include: poor weight gain, poor feeding, irritability, fussiness, difficulty breathing, sweating, pale skin.

I have been concerned about Charlotte since the start but was often dismissed and the cardiologists here said that this is extremely rare todiagnose. In 299,999 children the symptoms they have would usually be for something else such as colic but Charlotte was the 1. I will thank my lucky stars every day that I kept pushing for answers and we found out about this when we did.

Everyone at the hospital is amazed at how well she has learnt to cope with her condition. She’s meeting milestones and doesn’t look unwell at all. They said her fussiness and irritability was probably her trying to tell us something waswrong and over time she’s just learnt to cope with things as best she can.

The reason I have started this go fund me is to help support us financially through this time and any money that isn’t used will be donated to the Continental Heart Diseases Association.

Neither of us will be working until Charlotte is in a stable condition post surgery and when this may be nobody knows for sure yet. Reece is driving too and from hospital everyday and as you’re probably aware parking around here is incredibly costly. The last thing we want to be worrying about is money and I don’t even want to be asking for the support but we want to reserve all our worries and energy for our little darling and not money so any donations or visits (to go for a walk with Reece or I) or meals would be greatly appreciated.

Lots of love, Emma and Reece Moxon and of course our little angel Charlotte.

He stays busy chopping firewood in his spare time, making the most of the resources he finds just as he learned to do being an Eagle Scout and a father of five children. Now the resource he needs is you.

Stage 3 voicebox cancer has shown up and disrupted his life. He beat cancer once, but that battle took so much from him. The vicious disease is back, this time to take his voice. 

Thanks be to God for his skilled doctor, but the fight ahead of him is going to be life changing. His voicebox will be removed, the hospital stay will be long, and the recovery will be emotionally and physically hard.

Will you strengthen him with your prayers and donations to support him through this fight?

Hudson and his family during the first days they learned of his tumor.WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 2021The youngest son of the Lee family, Hudson, a sophomore in high school, has been diagnosed with a very rare form of brain cancer.An avid runner with a great love for Cross Country, he celebrated his 16th birthday on January 17th 2021 by running 16 miles in the cold weather!Three days later he told his parents that he had been struggling with a headache over the past several days. Within 24 hours, he was seen by his pediatrician who scheduled an MRI for the next day.On January 21st, the MRI confirmed their worst fears, a brain stem tumor.On Tuesday, January 26th, a biopsy was conducted so doctors could determine the best course of treatment. Hudson’s parents and doctors at Dayton Children’s worked with specialists in the local region in hopes of finding a clinical trial where he could be placed. On Thursday, February 4th, he was transported to Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio for further evaluation. Specialists determined that due to the severity of Hudson’s situation he did not currently qualify for the clinical trials they were hoping for, and the best plan of action was for him to begin a six-week course of radiation therapy to stabilize and hopefully shrink the invasive tumor. At this time the plan is for Hudson to stay at Dayton Children’s while being transported daily to Cincinnati for treatment. On Wednesday, February 10th, doctors completed the SIM, necessary for radiation mapping.The current plan is that Hudson will begin radiation on Tuesday, February 16th.Hudson has been hospitalized continuously since January 21st with the expectation that he will be unable to return home for the foreseeable future due to feeding and breathing concerns, and his inability to move or communicate verbally anymore. For anyone who wishes to support the family with their rapidly increasing medical bills, it is incredibly appreciated.Hudson’s family is only thinking positive thoughts and ask that you do the same for him. For those of you that know Hudson… you know he is sweet and kind, has an easy smile and laugh, and you know that he is a fighter!In his first days at Children’s as he lay in his hospital bed with the fresh knowledge he had a brain tumor, the question Hudson wanted answered was, “When can I run again?”Please pray for his family’s strength and Hudson's recovery. They can use all the prayers and good thoughts you can give.

She was Kayla's first horse of her own and her pride and joy. She was an amazing jumper. Unfortunately, Shiloh had some kind of unknown accident with a puncture wound in the top of her right front leg ..in which she was held in a sling for 4 weeks because she could not put weight on the leg without risking further injury. After recovering from this her back and withers and muscles were damaged from being in the sling for that long. Her leg wasn't healed 100% and Kayla was debating on retiring her for the winter then reassess her comfort in the spring. About 2 months ago, not officially recovered yet, Shiloh's same front right leg got kicked and broken by another horse at feeding time. It has come to the point where Shiloh is no longer eating her medications, her other legs are unable to carry her weight, she cannot lie down, hasn't lied down in months and she isn't healing the way she should be..The one time that she did try to lay down due to exhaustion, she hurt her self worse. She is losing weight and has no muscle mass left on her right side. She is slowly deteriorating and still would need to recovery from surgery, if she was even capable of making the trailer ride to the clinic. The vet has given Kayla the ultimatum of either surgery which could cost up to $40,000 with no guarantees Shiloh would ever be comfortable again, or ultimately euthanize her.  Shiloh is scheduled for Euthaization tomorrow (Monday 1/09/2017) at 10am. The cremation and pick up services will cost $2500.  I'm asking friends for a little bit of financial help for my daughter to assist with this cost, it being such an emotionally and financially devastating time. She still has astronomical vet bills for this horse that need to be paid off as well so any further contributions are deeply and genuinely appreciated.Read more"

Our dad Owen a 77 year old 11th Infantry Vietnam Veteran (dad) who survived a landmine explosion in 1968 (as a medic) during the Vietnam war and was left with a paralyzed lower leg and who spent a whole year at Walter Reed hospital recovering from his War injury, was rescued by his 44 year old daughter who broke an upper-level window with her bare hands after discovering that the house was on fire and waking up her parents in their upper level bedroom, during a devastating house fire on October 29, 2020. 

His daughter miraculously pulled him through the upper level window just as a cloud of flames rushed to that window and on to a lower level roof. 

In turn the 77 year old 11th Infantry veteran fearlessly jumped off of the lower level roof and then immediately ran around to a lower level window and broke it with his hands to rescue his 68 year old wife ""a God fearing and devoted wife and mother who has worked to support her family all of her adult life up to the date of the fire"" who took the stairs to the lower level of the house. 

Their home of 46 years was completely destroyed by flames but all three of the family members who were inside miraculously made it out in a nick of time.

All three were hospitalized for more than 30 days in the ICU of a Washington DC Hospital Burn Center with second and third degree burns to their faces and upper extremities. Our mom was given 2% chance of surviving while our dad was given 10% and our sister was given 50% chance.

Our mom graduated from the Washington Hospital Burn Unit ICU after being there for 50 days and is currently finishing her recovery at a burn rehab center where she is being slowly weaned from a ventilator and learning to walk and talk again. Our dad graduated from the ICU after 40 days and is recovering with family and home nursing.

The family including their son who was at work during the time of the fire has lost everything in their home of 46 years and the insurance will only cover for some of the structure but none of the items.

We the sons and daughters have started this GoFundMe to help with the rebuild and replacement of the many items that were destroyed and to ease the burden that our parents would face without support.

Iza is fighting this, as her own mother had only 6 years ago, and is a survivor. Halina (Iza’s mother) beat cancer, and now Iza begins her journey to beat this as well.Five months ago, Iza discovered a lump in her breast, upon visiting the doctor, and lab work, they diagnosed as Stage 2 breast cancer and successfully had it removed through a lumpectomy. However, following the surgery, her doctors discovered cancer which had spread in her lung. Iza’s form of breast cancer was not genetic. Iza’s oncologist recommended chemo and radiation in which she will start on November 13th, 2020 for approximately 6 months. Naturally, she would not have the energy to continue with her career of teaching, and will need to focus on rest, her treatments and healing.The emotional overwhelming impact this has been on Iza has influenced her desire for a natural holistic approach and left herself, family, and friends researching for more options. After researching, we had found a local holistic treatment that she feels really good about. Iza has decided to do the holistic treatments, alongside her doctor recommended chemo and radiation treatments. This means she will need to pay out of pocket expenses which include co-payments, prescriptions and the holistic treatment plan, not to mention the fee’s she has already spent out of pocket and others that will come along the way.Your financial contribution, love and good healing vibes will support Iza in recovery and all is appreciated! Our goal is to raise $10,000.

UPDATE!! The surgery date has been SET! June 5th 2021 is the day I will be flat!!!



Hello!!



My name is Stevie Jae Davis. I am a queer and trans/non-binary performer and teacher that really just wants my body to feel like home. In order to achieve that, I am planning on undergoing Top Surgery, (a procedure where the breasts are removed in order to bring gender euphoria). My relationship with my breasts is quite a negative one, it would be an understatement to say we are not friends. And what do you do with friends who are causing you pain? You remove them from your life.



I plan on getting my surgery performed by Dr. Gary A. Smotrich at Lawrenceville Plastic Surgery. This is not covered by my insurance which means I need to pay for this out of pocket. Yoinks!



The total cost of surgery is $8,300.

My goal is to raise a Grand Total of $10,000.

Wowie, I know that sounds like a whole lot of money but here’s the deal, it will be used to:



1) Pay for the surgery itself (including the facility fee and anesthesia).



2) Cover the processing/transaction fees that GoFundMe itself takes.



3) The recovery process is a lengthy one, having me out of work for 2-3 weeks at least (since I teach gymnastics to 5 year olds and I won’t be able to raise my arms over my head). I need to cover my necessities including; food, medical supplies and rent.



4) whatever I have left over I plan to donate to Various Trans POC seeking gender affirmation-surgery.



If you know me, you know this is something I’ve been wanting/needing for quite a long time, Something that I think about every single day. If you don’t know me, this is a life saving procedure. I am proud of myself for finally having the courage to make this a reality for myself.



I understand that money is tight right now due to the pandemic but anything to help me makes a huge difference.



I Appreciate Y’all!

30 days not going to work. 30 days not seeing your family and friends. 30 days not sleeping in your own bed. 30 days not driving your car. 30 days not being outside in fresh air. 30 days not seeing anyone but the staff that are taking care of you. 30 days of not talking with out being short of breath. 30 days of not being able to do most of the things you love let alone the little things we take for granted.




30 days unable to breathe on your own without high amounts of supplemental oxygen.



This is my sister , my best friend. The person I would call if something like this was going on with someone else I cared for to lean on. She is my person and I am hers. I’m asking anyone that can to please donate to help Shannon. Everyday is a fight and she’s a tough Cookie , but this is a long road.


I just want to make things easier for her now so she doesn’t have to worry ( she’s a Bakka we worry a lot ) and we can help keep her day to day life going until she comes home. 


I want to thank every single person who has helped donate and send prayers and light. If you can’t donate prayers are free and we will take every single one with love and grace. Thank you from the bottom of my heart and my families for being such a supporter of our Shannon. ❤️❤️

#teamshammonwb




















Shannon is not only my sister but myBest friend . She is one of the kindest and sweetest people I know. She is the person that would do anything to help her friends and family.



Right now she needs that in return.



Her smiling eyes and sunshine smile aren’t as bright right now as she is fighting to breathe due to complications of COVID-19.



Shannon has been hospitalized for the last 10 days in tbe ICU and progressive units, every day her focus must be to try and breathe and gain back her strength.



As everyone has so generously asked what they can do her family has chosen to go this route in an effort to help alleviate some of the financial burden that will come.To keep her focus centered on her long road to recovery this is a way she cannot stress about her day to day.



We have been told she has many challenges ahead of her. Not being able to see her and support her personally has been trying not only to her  but her family and friends.Shannon has a long way to go but with every accomplishment I tell her it takes little wins to get to the big victory

THANK YOU all for your prayers, love and support for Shannon ❤️❤️

Earlier this year I got to the end of the process to get this expensive procedure covered only to lose my insurance, and all of my progress, at the last moment due to a clerical error.Now, my surgery is scheduled for late November, and I’ve finally gotten to the finish with only 2 obstacles left: out-of-pocket costs associated with the surgery and quality-of-life expenses (scar repair cream, post-op care, meal & grocery delivery, etc.). Some wonderful friends already contributed almost $500 to me directly (thank you!) and I’ve been saving every bit that I can. I still need roughly $1,000 for the procedure and about $800 for other expenses.This year I’ve struggled with food insecurity and chronic health issues, and even with 2 jobs, it has been extremely difficult for me to build up a reliable enough income stream to survive during COVID, let alone plan for major surgery.Having this procedure done will drastically improve my mental health, which will allow me to do better for the kids I dedicate my time to supporting.

On Saturday, March 13, she was transferred over to UNMC in Omaha to see more specialists after some complications.She finally came home on Tuesday, March 16 to rest up and regain some strength before her next surgery in April to remove the rest of her cancer.We all know that my mom is a strong woman, and would give her shirt off of her back to anybody in need. She recently retired after 35 years at Mutual of Omaha to try something new, and was starting up some interviews again for her next chapter in life.

Hello Friends,On July 4, 2020, Nick was involved in a horrific accident with a malfunctioned firework. The firework exploded on the ground near him and hit him in his left eye, causing severe burns to his eyelid and his cornea. Our doctors in California unsuccessfully attempted to reconstruct his eyelid and had no hope for restoring his vision. After extensive research we found a hospital in Boston, Mass. that was willing to perform the reconstructive surgery and enroll Nick in a study that could potentially restore his vision. We relocated to Boston and then found out that our insurance is denying all claims because they are 'out of network' The potential sight restoring surgery is covered through a grant study from Mass. Eye and Ear, but they do not cover doctor visits, imaging, blood work, prescriptions or the donor cornea. This will be about 10,000 . The cost for the eyelid reconstruction surgery, blood tests and imaging exceeded $23,000. Nick had his first surgery. We were able to charge part of it on our credit cards. We have been able to cover cover all costs up until this point, including relocating Nick and his mother to Boston for treatment, co payments, ambulance fees and prescriptions. Now that the Covid 19 vaccine is becoming available, our living expenses in Boston have become outrageous. Up until this point, we have been able to keep a small apartment near the hospital, but our landlord just informed us that our rent will be significantly higher beginning in April. Sadly, we are looking for a new place to stay with more reasonable rent. This is difficult, because Nick is recovering from his surgery. The doctors told us that Nick cannot have another procedure on his eye until he heals from the surgery, which will be at least thirty days. We're hoping they will be able to schedule the next surgery immediately after the thirty day recovery period. We did not expect the testing, imaging, doctor visits and prescriptions to be this expensive. We are raising the amount of our goal to cover the costs related to the second surgery. Please help by sharing this with your friends and family, every dollar counts. If you can find in your hearts to help us out, there are no words to express our gratitude.

During these times, we understand if you cannot donate, but we ask that you please share this story with your friends and family in hopes that somebody may be able to help Nick out.

Thank you!



(Beneficiary is listed as Issa Kharufeh - this is Nick’s father who will be making the payment to the hospital on Nick’s behalf with the generous donations)

He loves taking care of people, and continued doing so despite the risks he faced daily due to the pandemic. Unfortunately Seth fell prey to the dangers that healthcare workers face daily, and he tested positive for Covid on February 9. Within two days of being tested, he had to be admitted to the hospital and placed in ICU after he developed severe COVID pneumonia. After his 3rd day in ICU, Seth was still unable to fight the infection on his own, so he was placed on a ventilator in an effort to allow his body to rest and use all his energy towards helping his body fight the infection. The following day he qualified for possible treatment using an ECMO machine (which is a device that basically can do the job of the lungs, and is able to clean blood ridding it of Co2 and putting O2 back in, furthering his bodys ability to save even more energy in hopes that it will aid in fighting off the infection and eventually allow his lungs to hopefully start healing. Wednesday night Seth was life flighted to a facility that had an ECMO available, St. Vincent Hospital in Little Rock. He is currently still in ICU where he continues to be treated on a ventilator awaiting the doctors to determine if and when he will be placed on the ECMO. He has been in ICU since February 11. The doctors expect him to be there for quite some time due to the severity of his pneumonia , and his recovery will take months at best for him to fully heal his lungs. Seth is married to Jessie and they have three children. Without him, their small business cannot continue. His practice of 20 years is the only income source for the family, and with his absence it has been forced to “temporarily” shut down until he can return to work. That coupled with an undetermined amount of time it will take for him to recover, inevitably it will create a huge financial burden for his family. Seth is married to Jessie Garner, they have three children and have been lifelong residents of NW Arkansas. To help cover hospital bills, their loss of income, and travel expenses for the family to travel back and forth to Little Rock while he recovers please donate anything to get them through this time.Read more"

I am 23 years old and live in a small town just outside of Fresno, California. On January 18th, 2019 I shattered my t-12 vertebrae in a snowboarding accident. In result to this, my spinal cord was compressed by 50% leaving me completely paralyzed from the belly button down. During the time that I was in the hospital a dear friend of mine named Sheldon Sandstrom created a go fund me. As a result of many of your donations: I was able to pay for the portion of my medical bills insurance didn’t cover, it sustained my family for six weeks so my parents could spend that time helping me, it adapted my home along with paying for all the equipment I needed to help transition, and most importantly it helped me regain my independence. Words cannot describe how grateful I am for the donations and prayers I received during that time. I was also fortunate enough to attend physical therapy after I was discharged from the hospital. Among other things, I was able to begin walking with the assistance of braces and a walker/canes. Unfortunately, this has only gotten me so far in my pursuit of recovery and insurance had no choice but to eventually discharge me from therapy. I then began doing the exercises they taught me on my own, but have still been limited. My hopes for this go fund me is to raise enough money to pursue some form of outpatient stem cell therapy. After extensive research and consults I have narrowed it down to a single; the Bioxcellerator clinic in Medellin, Columbia. Bioxcellerator is a U.S based company in Phoenix, Arizona but work out of Columbia. They have multiple testimonials on their website from people with and without spinal cord injuries. Bioxcellerator also has interviews from athletes such as: Chuck Liddell, Matt Hughes, Frank Edgar, Ken Shamrock, Mike Tyson, Henry Cejudo, and many more on their YouTube channel. There is also numerous videos of people talking about stem cells from Bioxcellerator on Joe Rogans podcast. The only drawback to stem cells is the expenses. Due to insurance not covering these types of therapies the fees come straight out of your own pocket. Treatments at Bioxcellerator start at around 55,000 dollars. This includes: multiple rounds of stem cells, blood work, follow ups for a year, specialist to oversee treatments/follow ups, a vitamin program prior to stem cells, and more. Over seventy percent of their past patients with SCI regain some form of mobility. I truly believe that stem cells have promise in the pursuit of recovery for spinal cord injuries. Regardless of whether or not you decide to donate please continue to pray for me and follow along on this journey. I have posted links to a youtube video of my physical therapy progress over the past year, my social media, and links to Bioxcellerators website/ social media platforms.

He weighed in at 9 pounds 1 ounce and is 20 inches long. 

There were some complications during his birth, which cut off blood flow to his brain for 2 minutes. Soon after delivery he was sent to the NICU at Tufts Medical Center. His liver is weak and they have him on a cooling blanket for the next 48 hours to lower his body temperature. Lowering his body temperature, should relieve any pressure in his head reducing the risk of brain injury. In the upcoming days they will warm him up and send him for an MRI to check for any damage.
These are some words from Calvin:
    “He is a child of God and with every prayer he gets the strength he will need to fight to live a life that he has no idea exists yet. Thank you all for the continued prayers, love, and support. We are forever grateful to each and everyone of you.”

Christina and Calvin are at Tufts with their son. Christina’s insurance will only cover one more day for her to stay at the hospital. I’m reaching out on their behalf, asking for donations, so that they can focus on their son’s recovery. I would appreciate anything anyone could donate. The money donated will go towards the cost of travel back and forth from Salem to Boston, food, bills while they are out of work, and the remainder will go towards medical bills.

Thankfully, he wasn't hit by a vehicle and a passerby saw the accident and was able to call for help. Todd was life-flighted from Park City to the University of Utah where they spent the next 24 hours discovering his injuries. He has broken ribs on both sides, a broken neck, a broken sternum, and most devastating, his back is broken at T7 (below his diaphragm). Consequently, Todd is now a paraplegic. They still haven't been able to assess the damage to his pelvis or knees. As you can imagine, the family is absolutely devastated, afraid, and overwhelmed. This news comes just weeks after finding out they are expecting their 2nd baby, due in May 2021. Anyone who knows Todd knows he is the funniest, easy-going, honest guy who prides himself on providing and caring for his wife, Jessica, and 3-year-old son Nolan. They have the sweetest love with no lack of healthy banter. They are some of the hardest working people you will ever meet. Jessica is a health care worker for a local children's hospital and Todd a Project Manager for a construction company. He works a very physically demanding job, he loves to build things, is an avid cyclist, and loves doing anything outdoors. This year has been a long one. They purchased a home almost a year ago that needed a complete renovation. Todd worked a full-time job during the day and went to the new house after he got off work and worked late into the night and every weekend getting it liveable for his family, doing most of the work himself. During this time he saw his family very little. They were able to move into their home in June, but they still have several things that were left unfinished. If you know this family, you must also know that they are both fighters. Jess and Todd are both in long-term recovery, and both have more than 10 years sober.Jess is terrified about what their future holds, but she is holding it together for her family. Todd is currently in the surgical ICU with no clear idea of when he will be able to start rehabilitation. At this point, he has had two surgeries and will likely need more. He does have use of his arms, but the broken sternum is preventing him from bearing no more than 10 pounds. The University hospital is not in-network for their insurance and the hope is that once he is out of the ICU he can be moved to an in-network hospital to continue receiving care. The road to recovery is long and the financial strain is overwhelming. Everyone is asking what they can do to help, and right now, the most helpful thing would be for them to be able to focus on his rehabilitation, instead of how they are going to pay for it. Jess is currently taking unpaid time off because her PTO must be saved to have time off when their baby is born. This money will go directly to the family for medical bills, rehab, and equipment for him as well as equipment to make their home wheelchair accessible, and any other related expenses. Todd's spirits range from joking with the nurses to being absolutely crushed that he may never mow the lawn with his little buddy again. Jess feels the weight of the world on her shoulders right now and I am hoping, with the help of people who are as kind and generous as they are, we can help carry them through this. She never asks anyone for anything and reluctantly agreed to let me start this fund because she never wants to be a burden to anyone. I want to thank everyone who has taken the time to read this. If you can't donate, please share and say a prayer for their family. In an attempt to help alleviate the stress of keeping so many people updated, I will share updates directly from Jess to this page as often as they are available.Read more"

The next couple days his wife and 2 of his 3 kids also tested positive. By 12/28 he was being rushed to South Shore Hospital and by 1/11 he was intubated. He told his wife Laura he wasn't going to talk with his kids or the rest of the family, as he was just going to sleep for a bit and then wake up and get better. Unfortunately it hasn't been that easy. A week later he was taken by med flight to Brigham and Women's Hospital, where he's been since.Last week we were hopeful that he would receive a tracheostomy and then could start the long road back to recovery. Unfortunately on Super Bowl Sunday they discovered he'd lost an extremely large amount of blood. He had to have an emergency procedure that did not stop the bleeding so they then needed to perform full blown surgery in the middle of the night. Derek survived this and on Tuesday actually stabilized.Sadly, we discovered his lungs were suddenly developing severe fibrosis on Wednesday and Thursday. Laura and the kids were allowed to go in and see him. He remains on very high ventilator support and they're treating him with dozens of medicines. But the doctors have told us that the next couple days will be critical in telling us how all this will turn out. We're praying for a miracle.Meanwhile, vast medical expenses are piling up, Laura and her children have finally recovered from their Covid illness, but there's been very little income over the past several weeks. I'm hoping you all can help us to help them. Please consider donating so we can lift some of the burden from their shoulders.

It dealt many of us significant challenges and hardships in different ways.Unfortunately, one of those hardships for my mother, Jackie, was her diagnosis of breast cancer. 2020 decided to leave us with one final parting gift. Early on it appeared that the cancer had been caught at a point where a lumpectomy would be able to be performed to remove the tumor and proceed on the road to recovery. What followed in the next several months consisted of many tests, scans, and consults on how best to proceed forward. On February 8, 2021, Jackie underwent a double mastectomy to remove the cancerous tissue and hopefully leave this horrible part of her life behind her.Well, as the saying goes, sometimes you get kicked when you’re down. During Jackie’s surgery, a special radioactive dye was injected into the breast tissue that travels through the lymphatic system to help identify the sentinel lymph nodes. These sentinel nodes are then removed and tested to see if the cancer has spread beyond a localized zone to determine the state of how far the cancer has spread and progressed. Unfortunately there are some rare cases where the dye does not travel through the lymphatic system as expected and the sentinel node(s) cannot be identified. This is what occurred for Jackie. As such, we continue to live in a state of unknowns which has caused a great deal of stress and anxiety for all of us, none so much as Jackie. As my mother’s care team at Gundersen continues next steps in prepping for more follow-up surgeries and treatments, my parents decided to seek a second opinion at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. They had a consultation earlier this week and the team at Mayo started several additional tests and are looking at additional treatment options. It’s hard to put a price on life, but as it turns out, with the American health care system you can, and it’s not cheap. In the process of seeking out other care options at Mayo, my parents now find themselves in a situation where their insurance will not cover any of the costs related to treatment that is already beginning to tally in the tens of thousands after only a couple of visits for initial testing and consultation. This, sadly, is not such a unique story—and is one that many other people have experienced firsthand as they navigate the morbid reality of draining their savings, retirement, and potentially jeopardizing their future financial outlook as a means to keep themselves alive.If you know my mother Jackie, then you know she has spent the past several decades making a career in fundraising. The irony is not lost on me that someone who has spent her life organizing fundraising initiatives for different organizations, non-profits, and other charitable initiatives would never ask for any help for herself. Enter me. Her son.Now, I’d like to pause here to give a bit of context, clarity, and some brief levity. First, I must admit that—while rare—we non-doctor/nurse Utz’s do exist. As Jackie’s son, I am one of those such people. There’s not many of us, and we’re all considered great failures in the eyes of our ancestors, but alas we slog on through our mediocrity. I disclose this for two reasons. One, I’d like give myself some leeway in describing complex medical procedures for which I have no knowledge of (I had to Google quite a few of those things you just read to make sure I got the all the spelling correct. Again, apologies to my forefathers). And two, things were getting a bit heavy there and I thought I’d pump the brakes and throw in some frivolity for a second. Levity aside, my parents are hardworking people who will do whatever it takes to get by. Like many people they’ve experience their fair share of ups and downs over the years and this is not something that anyone plans for. I double-checked and, as it turns out, I am not an heir to the Utz Pretzel empire and am unable to tap into that pretzel money (although I do enjoy their products – seriously that Pub Mix is no joke). So, while I am not a professional fundraiser like my Mom, I ask that you look into your hearts and offer some help to a great woman as she continues her battle in kicking cancer’s ass.Forever and always her favorite son,- CharlieRead more"

Yesterday we received the dreadful news that our sweet Border Collie, Sonny is in immediate need of a life savingoperation. He has been diagnosed with a tumour in his abdomen, which, if left untreated will kill him. He’s been the most loving and faithful friend since we rescued him 12 years ago from Ferne Animal Sanctuary, and he is still very fit andfull of life, The Vet says it is operable, and if successfully removed there’s a good chance of him making a full recovery. We have insurance but nothing like the costs incurred by the various scans, tests and the operation itself. Unbelievably this comes to £6,000! We can raise some of this but with the impact of Covid on my live work as a singer songwriter – normally my main income - we are seriously strapped. So we are asking if you could possibly contribute to this fund to raise as much as we can to help our beautiful boy. We will be so grateful for any donations, no matter how small.Thank You so much!

He was immediately identified as a trauma alert patient and was rushed to Halifax Health Medical Center. Seth remains in critical condition - with multiple surgeries still to come to repair his broken legs, pelvis, wrists and jaw. As we are still in the critical stages of recovery, more injuries may be discovered as the days go on.What about spinal cord damage, you ask? None so far! He has even shown early signs of reflexes in his toes reinforcing this -- thank goodness for helmets!Seth is a father, a son, a husband, a brother, a cousin, a nephew, a grandchild, and he is so very loved by us all. We know that his first priority would be to ensure his children and his wife are provided for, and with the significant injuries he has endured, it is unlikely he will be cleared to return to work for many, many months‘What is broken can be mended, what hurts can be healed, and no matter how dark it gets, the sun is going to rise again.’ Today feels dark, but we know Seth is strong. He will continue to overcome whatever is thrown at him.Our family has had an outpouring of support from our friends and family asking how they can support financially, or otherwise, and we are so touched by this thought.While he has medical benefits through the VA from his time served in the Army, he does not have short term disability or accident coverage to help with the expenses outside of medical. Since the full extent of his injuries are unknown still and the path to recovery will be long, this will be the largest financial burden to his young family.All money will be used to lessen the stress on Seth’s wife while she manages the day to day expenses of a family of four on her own in the coming months.Anything raised over and above this will be placed in an education fund specifically for Seth’s two young children.From our family to yours, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your love, support and positive thoughts during this stormy time.Prefer Venmo? @JWhitmer61419Read more"

The ambulance was called & she was rushed to the hospital, her condition unknown. She was almost immediately intubated, put on a breathing machine & taken into the ICU. After days of testing, doctors discovered a spinal infarction, which is a stroke within the spinal cord. She was also diagnosed with pneumonia caused by her aspirating vomit into her right lung. Frank & Dina have 3 other kids, two of them in the home also have autism & developmental delays. Dina is a stay at home mom & takes care of her 3 special needs kids, while Frank works to financially support the family. Because of healthcare regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic Dina has been the only one allowed, for the most part, to be by her daughter's side. Which leaves Frank to care for their 2 other special needs kids & also try to make a living to support his family. Frank works at a call center that has him working from home right now, but currently he cannot find time to work & also care for his 2 special needs kids. Thank goodness most of their daughter's medical & rehab bills will be covered by medicaid, but help is needed with other financial responsibilities from food & gas to take their kids to their appointments, to running errands, to rent & utilities to keep a roof over their heads. Their daughter has been slowly showing signs of some improvement, but she still needs assistance breathing. On Aug 25th doctors performed a tracheotomy & on the 28th she'll be transported from the ICU to a rehab hospital. Doctors say recovery could be 3 months to a year depending on her rate of recovery. They're optimistic she'll make a full recovery with enough care and rehab. The rehab hospital has the same regulations as the hospital, no visitors but only one parent will be allowed. So mom will stay at the hospital & dad will be responsible for their 2 other special needs kids, running the household & try to work as often & as best he can. Their oldest daughter was able to get some time off of work to help out & she & their extended family has also done what they can to help out as best as they can.

We always pushed it off as seasonal allergies but as the symptoms persisted, they got progressively worse over the years. Fast forward to early 2020. She was unable to fully breathe out of her nose and as the year progressed the pain and restlessness also increased. As soon as she was able to apply for government-assisted healthcare we decided to take her to the ER because by that point the pain was near constant and spreading through her head. The hospital discovered a large bone tumor growing inside of her sinus and nasal passages, completely blocking the sinuses on the right side of her face and starting to overtake the left side as well, completely obscuring her septum. To compensate, her sinuses were trying to reshape themselves around the growth, to no avail.In late July Jes ultimately had to stop work completely (she tried to resume multiple times but was too drained both physically and mentally). After numerous follow up appointments, tests, MRI’s, and CT scans, Jessica’s surgery was set for September 4th. On September 4th Jessica was administered to the O.R. for an endoscopic nasal surgery that would last approximately 16 hours. Once the operation had begun the surgeons and doctors noticed more complications than the imaging scans were able to initially show. The tumor was solid bone, as dense as her skull, and proved difficult to remove, but was thankfully benign. It was very large for a tumor of its type (an ostemoa) and had developed spikes that jutted outward from its original position. The team said they hadn’t seen anything like it before. They successfully removed all the tumor and admitted Jes into the ICU, however they didn’t realize that since the tumor spikes had pushed up against her dura (a layer of flesh matter that incases the brain and spinal regions) for so long, the pressure from the tumor had caused it to become very fragile and unknowingly rip, causing a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak in multiple spots. This was discovered roughly 14 hours after surgery when they were about ready to release her. The doctors then informed her family and I that if left alone this could cause meningitis, which could possibly be fatal if left ignored.A few days after her first surgery, she was brought back into the O.R. again to try and find and seal those leaks. This second surgery lasted for about 6 hours, but the surgeons were still unsure if they had addressed every issue. During this time Jes was dealing with the most severe level of pain to date because of the high amounts of CSF that had left her brain.She was on strict bed rest, constant painkillers, and couldn’t even lay her head above 30 degrees without getting level 5-8 pain headaches and blurry vision. Jes was admitted to the O.R. again on September 9th for her third and final surgery. This time they had an entire team of doctors there for more assistance and were able to dye the color of her CSF fluid through a lumbar drain to better identify the holes remaining in the dura. The dye wasn’t used the first time because it carries risks of inducing seizures in some patients and is only used in a last ditch effort. Thankfully, this did not happen, and after 6-8 long hours of surgery, the doctors were highly optimistic about the resulting dura graft and that she would make a full recovery. They unfortunately had to sacrifice her sense of smell (and taste) in order to reach and seal the dura by shaving down some of her nerves. During this procedure, they also accidentally cut a hole in the roof of her mouth and left her with an ulcer, as the area is extremely delicate.After everything, Jes finally got to come home on September 13th. She is still extremely exhausted and in some lingering pain from the surgeries. Although she is very happy to be alive and home in her own bed, she is very depressed about the potentially permanent loss of her smell and taste. The doctors ordered she take CSF leak precautions for the next month, meaning she can’t strain her muscles at all: she can’t bend down, get up on her own, carry anything heavier than a gallon of milk, use her arms to support herself, cough, sneeze (though with her mouth open is possible), bare down, etc. It’s going to be a challenge, but we’re all so grateful that she’s home.2020 has been a very hard year for so many of us, but if anyone can spare a donation to this GoFundMe, please know that any and all funds will help with Jessica's recovery. She hasn’t been able to work since late July and that has heavily affected both of our incomes since I work along side her and she is in charge of completing our costumes. Our emergency funds are now dry and this would greatly help us as she eases back into everyday life. These recovery funds would help with bills, rent, food and moving (did I forget to mention we’re also moving next month!?) while she recovers and finds a level of normality again. Taking care of her through this recovery period is a full time job as she needs help with everyday tasks and getting up. She needs me to be around her constantly for help and to monitor as she regains her strength.Thank you for taking the time to read Jessica’s story. While we continue to heal we will keep moving forward with your support.Read more"

Each leg costing 4.5k and requiring 6 x weeks intense care after, the surgery’s need to be completed separately. Make the road to recovery for him a long one.We hate asking for help but this is an unexpected cost and after losing our income due to Covid (travel, events and fitness industries) we are struggling to find money for the high cost involved. Without this surgery he will not heal and the only other option is to be euthanised.

Winston is part of our family, if you know us you know how much we care and adore for our boy. He is very much loved amongst our family and friends.

I can’t stress how hard it is for us to ask for donations but if there is anyway you can spare some money to help him receive this surgery we will be forever grateful and appreciative.

This is causing a myriad of complex symptoms such as neuropathy nerve pain (Loss of balance, weakness, numbness, headaches and seizures). When I went to the Mayo Clinic on February 6th, I was told that because of the cancer’s location and blood supply to the brain it is inoperable and that they will watch it and make me as comfortable as possible until I die. I refused the idea that that was my only option, so I searched the country for a doctor who could help me. I finally found one in Hawaii who is giving me hope. She has a treatment that may shrink my tumor. This is my only chance at life.My goal is to raise $20,000. This will be used to cover the cost of my medical treatment/medication not covered by insurance, transportation and other necessary living expenses, such as food.Please, I am asking for donations no matter how small the amount you can give because it all adds up and means so much to me! I have established care with naturopathic doctors, physical therapists, acupuncturists and a neurosurgeon in Hawaii. They have offered me treatments that Mayo could not. My hope is that these treatments will shrink my tumor & relieve my symptoms. Most of this has not been covered by insurance.

Jenna and David Lutz went in for their 31 Week appointment with their soon to be little girl and they noticed Jenna's blood pressure kept rising as well as platelets and white blood cells being very low.After seeing a high risk specialist, Jenna was admitted into the hospital. Doctors ran a variety of tests and even started considering that she was ""pancytopenic"".After more blood tests and even a bone marrow biopsy with no anesthesia (due to keeping baby Haley safe) Jenna finally got to go home.

She was given strict rules including taking her temperature multiple times a day, checking for baby kick counts, wearing a mask if anyone visits, no driving, and seeing her OB twice a week for blood work.

All of these things include David taking on a major role with their toddler, Liam, whom Jenna stays home with. Groceries, driving around, etc.Once the results came in, David, Jenna and Liam learned that Jenna is being diagnosed with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia.Jenna will be in the hospital for a minimum of 2 weeks but most likely closer to 4-6 to treat her and keep baby Haley safe and sound in the womb.Having to explain to a 3 year old that his mommy cannot come home for a while is heartbreaking.We are hoping to raise money for very unexpected medical bills, possible child care expenses on top of David working less, and more.Family and friends of Jenna (and David & Liam) are praying for a full recovery and a healthy delivery of baby Haley.

If you can, please help the Lutz family today.

Carleigh and Ryan had returned home after celebrating a friend's wedding. It was getting late and Carliegh was ready to leave, but Ryan wanted to continue in the festivities. After arguing over leaving, they returned home and Carleigh went to bed. Ryan invited three friends over and began desparaging Carleigh to his friends. An argument between Ryan and his friends ensued and Ryan left the room. He went into the bedroom where Carleigh was sleeping, locked the door and began strangling her. Ryan's friends heard Carleigh call out and broke the bedroom door to get to her. Ryan began fighting his friends and pushed them out of the house and locked them out. The friends called the police and began trying to break through the front door. In the meantime, Carleigh had gone into the bathroom. Ryan followed her into the bathroom and began brutally beating Carleigh, slamming her head into the tub, biting wherever he could reach. He attempted to bite off her finger and the tip of her ear. He also attempted to rip her tongue out of her mouth. He dragged her through the house, leaving a quarter sized opening on her forehead. At some point during the beating, Carleigh lost consciousness, eventually awakening with a female officer standing over her, calling for an ambulance.Beyond the injuries already described, there were over 20 bite marks throughout her body. The severe beating also resulted in swelling and blood on her brain. Carleigh has an extremely long road to recovery ahead of her. It will be at least three weeks before she can eat solid foods due to the severe damage to her tongue.

Last week Kiara was involved in a life changing accident. She fell from a set of stairs, about 6ft high head first onto concrete. She sustained a multitude of injuries including a fracture to her C1 vertabrae, multiple skull fractures, a broken rib, flesh wounds and so on. Her injuries are severe and dehibilitating. She is very lucky to be alive and even more lucky to have function of her arms and legs. Those of you who know Kiara know how compassionate she is. She would do anything for anyone without hesitation hence why she chose a career caring for people in the nursing field. I see this as our chance to repay the favour...For approximately the last year she has spent her time travel nursing, which essentially makes her a free bird aligning with her free spirit. Unfortunatley in this circumstance this means she did not have a permanent position nursing or in otherwords has no benefits. She had accepted a contract on Vancouver island and was meant to start 5 days from her accident. Needless to say she wont be returning to work in the near future. This leaves her bearing her mortgage and other financial obligations while out of work. It is undetermined how long she will be off work but its apparent she has a long recovery ahead of her. My goal is to alleviate the financial stress to some degree so that she can focus on healing. She is a strong determined woman and she will get through this. Help us give her the love and support she deserves.

On February 28th, Kianna was mauled by her best friends dog. Kianna was lucky to survive the attack. Unfortunately she is suffering from major facial lacerations, muscle and tissue loss in her face, and a broken arm. Tissue was recovered at the scene that has been reattached as a skin graft, hoping it will take. Due to the muscle loss in her face, she has suffered facial paralysis that can hopefully be reversed through additional surgeries.

Kianna requires constant care and will need future surgeries that will be considered cosmetic surgeries, even though they are crucial to her recovery, insurance will not deem them necessary. These follow-up surgeries will be important for her to regain some normalcy and feel like herself again.

All funds raised will be going towards medical supplies and other medical costs for Kianna’s long road to recovery.

As many of you know, my youngest brother, Brian Gerhauser, has suffered a debilitating stroke at the young age of 47. Brian is an amazing man. He works for the county in the grounds department. He is the father of two amazing adult children and grandfather to two adorable girls.

  Anyone who meets Brian is immediately in love with his comical personality. Brian makes everyone in his presence feel happy and comfortable, from family members to friends to Freeholders.

  The stroke has left Brian fighting to do everyday activities we all take for granted from walking to holding a pencil and all self care. His wife Denise and family are working hard to support his recovery, however, the bills are starting to pile up. while insurance is helping there are many copays and balance bills to be dealt with. with that said Brian and his wife are in needof some help.

Roger has been the life and soul of our family ever since we got him when he was just a puppy, nearly two years ago. On the 22nd of August, I will be running a marathon (26.2 miles) while wearing a 10kg weighted vest to try and raise any funds I can to help my parents with the financial burden that the cost of treatment has placed on them.When Roger was struck, his harness got caught up in the bumper of the car. Despite the driver braking, Roger was pulled some distance across the tarmac before the car came to a stop. Whilst he was very lucky to survive the ordeal, he came out of it with some serious injuries - totally losing most skin on his left side, exposing the muscle tissue and his knee and hip joints. Due to the extent of his wounds our local vet had to place him on fluids and refer him to a specialist vet clinic. Roger was treated over the next two weeks at the specialist clinic in Swindon, undergoing multiple scans and surgeries to treat the soft tissue damage that had occurred. He had to receive constant nursing care, CT scans, X-rays, stitches, and a tubed pedicle skin graft (to cover his exposed hip and knee joints). Even though the vets were able to cover most of his injury with the skin graft, they were not able to cover it all and Roger is left with a sizeable open wound, that could easily become infected. Despite all this, day by day Roger's prognosis began to improve, but the expense of the costly treatments began to pile up for my parents.After a very stressful two weeks for my parents, Roger was discharged and was able to come home. However, this was a bittersweet moment, as my parents were hit with a vet bill for £8,500; with Roger still requiring ongoing check ups and maintenance, resulting in further costs.In order to assist my parents with the huge financial burden of these treatments, I have decided to raise money by running 26.2 miles around Bristol while wearing a 10kg weighted vest. I will be taking on this challenge on Saturday, 22nd of August.I know these are currently very uncertain and difficult times, but even a small contribution would go a long way to helping my parents and Roger with these costs. However, if for whatever reason you are unable to donate, it would mean a lot to us if you could simply share this fundraiser.Thank you so much,Dmitry & Roger.Read more"

Within minutes, all our efforts to keep the flames at bay were becoming frivolous. Anthony stayed by with the hose until the fire department arrived, and the whole family came out in a frantic to help grab the animals from the flames. We were lucky enough to get out there in time to rescue all our animal residents, but they didn't go unscathed. Primarily our pig Scarlett, who alerted us to the fire, has suffered severe burns to her nose and feet and our little hero will be needing extensive care and many vet visits. Our ducks were grabbed just in the knick of time before their coop caught fire, but are currently residing in our bathtub to recover from trauma while we raise the money to re-build their beautiful little safe haven. The cats were taken out of the barn right away, but are also currently without a place to call their own since their room took the most damage and is unsalvageable.The fire department has restricted access to the entire area, so not a single square foot of our animal's homes will be salvageable. As much as we would all love to just get right back to work building them a safe space, this was so unexpected that financially it's going to be a struggle and a journey before we can have them all out again.We hate having to ask for help, but this is something that we unfortunately just can't do alone, and any small amount donated will go straight back to the animals, whether it be to the vet bills, or the duck bills. Many people know that we had created that barn area as a rescue area for abandoned animals, like our sweet Goose, who passed in December, and Scarlett the pig. It would break our hearts to have to retire our efforts due to this tragic incident, and we thank you in advance for anything you can do to help. To follow the progress of getting the ranch back to safety, feel free to follow mymoon.ranch on instagram so you can see what all the proceeds are used for and know that the money isn't being pocketed.If you're not in a financial position to donate money directly, please contact Maia via facebook with any physical donations you may have. Duck food, pig food, cat litter, blankets, bedding, or anything you happen to have that could make this all go a little smoother for our beloved pets will be welcome in a heartbeat and greatly appreciated. Anything truly helps at this point.With much gratitude,       ~The Langevin FarmRead more"

Her Husband, George Ignacio and her Father, Lamberto Palmares are both admitted in the hospital due to their worsening Covid19 symptoms. Tatay Lamberto has developed pneumonia and had suffered heart attack few days ago. He is currently in the ICU on life support. He is in critical condition and fighting for his life. Tatay Lamberto came to Edmonton as a visitor and was suppose to return home to the Philippines last year but his flights were cancelled due to pandemic situation. He was granted an extension to stay, however, his health insurance coverage has expired. And with this, he has to pay for all the medical services out of pocket. His bill is starting to build up. ICU rate is $8,932.50 per day and he's been in the ICU since February 7th.We are asking to help us pray for kuya George and Tatay Lamberto's recovery. Please include Cecilia and her 2 daughters as well as they are also fighting Covid19 at home.We recognize how difficult life is right now with COVID-19 and all the challenges that accompany it. With this fundraiser, we are hoping to help offset some of the cost associated with Tatay Lamberto's treatment/ medical care, as well as to be able to give Tatay Lamberto a chance to go back home to his wife and be with her in the Philippines when he recovers. If you are able, please consider donating. We would greatly appreciate any help you are able to provide. This will help relieve some of the stress that the family is going through right now.Thank you very much for your support and generosity. God bless and stay safe everyone.Read more"

Most of all, however, Lily loves spending time with her parents, Ramela and Jimmy, and her two sisters, Grace (13) and Ella (8).On April 15th, Lily was rushed to Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles with an unrelenting high fever and abdominal pains. Sadly, doctors found a 7 inch mass on her right kidney, with masses in her lungs and lymph nodes. Shortly thereafter, Lily was diagnosed withEwing’s Sarcoma, an extremely rare and aggressive cancer requiring immediate and intense chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.Unfortunately, cancer is a word that Lily is very familiar with.In 2011, Lily's maternal grandfather died of breast cancer (sadly, breast cancer occurs in men too). Two years later, Lily's mother, Ramela, courageouslyfought her own breast cancer battle at the age of 37, while caring for her three young daughters. And only 3 months after Ramela's last chemo treatment, Lily's grandmother (Ramela's mother) was diagnosed with breast cancer. There truly are no words to describe how much Lily's family has endured and now this...Lily’s parents are college sweethearts and were married shortly after Jimmy returned from his tour of duty in Iraq. Ramela teaches Art History at Pierce College and Jimmy is a high-school teacher at Holy Martyrs Ferrahian High School. As you can imagine, this catastrophic event has turned their world upside down. The family is now faced with additional financial burdens and medical treatments not covered by insurance. As Lily embarks on the fight of her life, her road to recovery will be long. Unable to attend school, Lily will be spending much of the upcoming year in and out of the hospital. This fundraiser has been established to help ease the burden on Lily's parents, so that the family can focus all their efforts on Lily’s treatment, healing and spending precious time together. Anyone who knows Ramela and Jimmy can attest to the fact that they are incredibly giving when it comes to their time, love, and energy for anyone in need. As the Abbamontians face the unthinkable and do all they can to help Lily beat cancer, if we can help alleviate some of the day to day financial pressures that will mount during this time of critical care, we too will have done our part to support them in a time of sincere need.#HelpLilyBeatCancerWith much gratitude,

She was admitted to Children's hospital in Minneapolis on Sunday (11/1) and moved to the ICU the next morning, all due to major complications with COVID. Ella arrived at the hospital with the following symptoms; severe cough, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhea, full body rash, chest pain, and a temperature of 104.5. It was soon determined that Ella had kidney failure, dangerously low blood pressure, a UTI, and bacteria infection. After day 5 in the ICU, Ella's mom Sarah, found out that her insurance does not cover hospitalizations. This was devastating news. Sarah is a loving and caring, SINGLE mom, and sole financial and physical provider for her three beautiful children (Jada, Ella, and Owen). She is hard working, loyal, ambitious, and currently living in her daughter's ICU hospital room praying for her recovery. There is no WAY most people, including Sarah, can afford this kind of care out of pocket. The bills will start coming and Sarah needs help.Sarah is an amazing human. She is proud, strong, determined, and of course HATES asking for help. However, in the same breath, she is the one of the most generous people I know, and is always the first person to jump in and go an extra 1000 miles to help ANYONE she knows that is in need. It is time for us to help Sarah (whether she likes it or not).I think the best way to give a clear picture of what Ella has been going through is to post all of the updates Sarah has been texting her family and close friends. Her updates paint a good picture of the HUGE capacity of medical care Ella is needing and receiving right now and how incredibly expensive it will be.Update from Sarah 11/2:Last night at 12am Ella was put under to get a central line in so they can administer stronger blood pressure meds. Her BP was just too low from the infections (Covid and UTI) and they wanted to get it under control better because all the bags of fluids and bolus bags (IV push) weren’t working. Last night they also put in a catheter because she wasn’t able to get rid of her urine on her own, now that she’s producing some.Her BP has gone up and temp has gone down...both good news. She’s really out of it still from being put under last night and is trying to rest. A through pelvic exam has been ordered for more cultures. Unfortunately, the UTI, bacterial infection, is just another sign of being extremely dehydrated with covid and being so sick.Thank you for your support. Sorry it’s been trying to give timely updates, as there’s a lot going on and changes happen minute by minute. We appreciate the love, prayers, and support. ♥️Update from Sarah, on 11/3:1:00pm Ella was sedated for further examination. Yesterday’s culture has shown she also has a bacterial staph infection: MSSA. So they are starting Ancef (antibiotic) which should treat the staph infection. Continuing the antibiotic clindamycin (and discontinued 2 other antibiotics). So this poor girl is dealing with Covid, a UTI and a Staph infection. (Not crazy uncommon as one would think because she was so severely dehydrated and her kidney failure caused her not to be able to get rid of her own waste/urine.)Update from Sarah on 11/4:Ella’s still in the ICU. She’s been on oxygen all day yesterday and still today. Her oxygenation percent drops into the mid 80s without it. (Normal is 95-100%.) She was throwing up last night and this morning still. Temp is down and BP is stable...so that’s good. She’s still on 2 antibiotics for the bacterial infection and UTI, which seem to be in better control...her overall body rash is much better. She’s expelling a lot more fluid with Lasix (diuretic), so she’s a lot less puffy as well. Temp is still low grade and that’s with contestant Tylenol. Throat pain and mouth pain are still extremely painful for her, so she was administered Oxycodone this morning for the pain, on top of the Fentanyl and Tylenol.She’s quite miserable with the coughing, sore throat and chest pain. (She just had another chest X-ray at 11:15am, yesterday’s showed some fluid buildup.) Her respiration rate keeps dropping as well, so they want to check on her chest pain. It’s so hard to see my sweet girl be hurting so bad and be so sad. With all of that...what does my sweet girl say to me while I’m rubbing her back and stroking her hair...while SHE’S throwing up and then goes into violently coughing up mucus?!? When she finally catches her breath, she says in her soft little raspy voice that’s barely remaining...‘thank you for comforting me mommy.’♥️She’s really just that sweet. It made me cry. Which I haven’t let her see all the times I’ve been so worried, scared and have cried. I’m trying to stay so strong for her because I know she’s very scared, she’s told me so. I just keep reassuring her she has an army praying for her. Thank you to each and everyone of you for your prayers and offering to help. We feel the love. xoRight before she was put under yesterday...this happened...Ella said she laid her head back onto the bed and God laid right next to her. She said a prayer and right when she said, ‘Amen’, she got a little squeeze on her arm and right then she said she knew it was going to be ok (she pointed to her blood pressure cuff regarding the squeeze on her arm). Update from Sarah later in the day 11/4:12:30pm The infectious disease team saw Ella again and said the chest X-ray showed fluid still in her lungs. Most likely from the Viral infection- Covid, which has turned to pneumonia.Remdesivir was started today at 3:45pm to try and treat the virus.A steroid (decadron) has now been started for inflammation concerns and also is a treatment for covid. They also started back up lasix (diuretic) to try to clear more fluid from her lungs.Aspirin’s been started too, along with the heparin, to avoid blood clots.4:00pm Arrhythmia showed up on the EKG that was taken today and then the echo cardio gram that was done showed some decreased heart function. She will see the cardiologist tomorrow.6:30pm Milrinone is being administered now to try to lessen the work of the heart and help it function better.Still her worse pain is her sore throat, mouth pain and violent cough and chest pain when coughing.#CovidSucks #wearyourmask Our God is mighty! but PLEASE #stayhomeifyouaresickThank you again for your prayers. ♥️ Goodnight. xoUpdate from Sarah on 11/5:5th day at Children’s - ICU9:00 Dr Zier (ICU) came in again this morning and noted that while some things are improving (body temperature and BP), unfortunately Covid has turned on Ella. Which is causing more serious problems for her than they normally see in children. Which has caused the pneumonia, kidney failure, liver distress, and heart failure. It’s a lot. On top of all that the bacterial staph infection has caused havoc on her poor body.4:00pm the cardiologist Dr Schneider came in....The EKG yesterday showed a 1st degree heart block. But, today it’s looking normal. She has a heart telemetry monitor hooked up on her 24 hours now to monitor her heart more closely. So they are still keeping a close eye on it.Yesterday, the Echo cardiogram showed her heart function was at 40% of her bottom chambers (normal is 50-60%). So they will repeat an echo cardiogram tomorrow on her.Ella’s been a bit more alert and awake this evening which has been nice to see. She even FaceTimed some friends tonight which felt normal, even though she’s in the ICU. Thank you again for all the love and support. xo ♥️Update from Sarah on 11/6:Still hanging out in the ICU. It’s very humbling when the room across from us has had 5 patients come and go and Ella is still here. It’s just another reminder of how sick she is.8:30am EKG performed.9:30am echo-cardio gram performed.Cardiologist - Dr Schneider stopped by and said today’s echo was improved from 2 days ago. EKG still showed 1st degree block, but less than 2 days ago.Heart Meds are being cut in half this afternoon and ending tonight to see how her heart functions without them.Crappy news is that she has Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart).Lovenox shots have been started (blood thinner) to avoid blood clots. Heparin has been stopped via her IV. She’s still on lasix (diuretic) to reduce the fluid from her lungs and Remdesivir to treat the viral infection Covid. She still has a catheter, telemetry heart monitor, and oxogen monitor. Coughing, sore throat, and breathing/chest pain are her biggest complaints today.In other crappy news, I discovered today that my health insurance has ZERO coverage for hospitalizations. At this point there’s nothing I can do. We’re here and my baby girl needs to be treated. I’m very thankful she is here and that she’s getting such great care. I’ll deal with finance issues later. #covidsucks #2020sucksAgain, thank you for all the love, prayers, support, offerings and friendship. xo ♥️This is now where we come in...friends, family, and people out there with BIG hearts and the financial means to help Sarah with what is soon to be an ABUNDANCE of medical bills for Ella's medical treatment. Unfortunately, this is not even close to over, and the bills will keep coming. Sarah's focus right now is on Ella and her recovery. The last thing she needs on top of everything else is to worry about how she will be able to continue to support herself and her three beautiful children.PLEASE consider making a donation, and PLEASE pray for Ella as she has a long road to recovery ahead of her ❤️ THANK YOU!Read more"

After making a late night food run, they were struck by an oncoming motor cyclist when pulling-out onto Fourth St.Sadly, our beloved Isha did not survive the crash and leaves two children behind in her passing. Our dear Carrie Sue is still in critical condition and we are continually praying for her to regain consciousness and survive her serious injuries. Thankfully, our sweet Jessica did not sustain life threatening injuries but clearly needs all the support she can get after enduring this traumatic accident.The purpose of this Go Fund Me is to help raise money for all three ladies. We are not sure exactly what their needs are at this time or how the funds will be divided but we will be consulting with them (their children [in Isha's case])once we're able in order to discover how great their needs are and allocate the funds accordingly.For Isha, it will likely be in the form of funeral funds or funds to help sort her outstanding affairs, and go to her children. For Carrie, we speculate that she will likely have some hefty medical bills as well as ongoing bills she is unable to handle in her current state. For Jessica we are not sure what her needs are yet but she also needed medical attention and may need some time away from work to process the trauma she has just been through which will require compensation to handle her affairs in the interim.Whatever you are able to contribute is greatly needed and appreciated as three women's lives have been severely upset and in one case, ended, due to this awful tragedy! Please share this as much as you can and give whatever you are comfortable giving as it will strictly be allocated to these three very treasured and very deserving young women and/or their children [in Isha's case]. Thank you.Update: On March 7th, 2021 a new Go Fund Me has been created just for Carrie Lindley and her growing medical needs. Please feel to donate separately to this other crowd fund as Carrie's needs are coming to light as the true depth of her injuries continue to be discovered: https://gofund.me/3b84970cUpdate: On March 7th, 2021 a new Go Fund Me was started just for Isha Clark and her children/estate. If you are at all able to donate in the coming weeks, please do so as her children have lost one of the most irreplaceable people in their lives. The trauma from this and the care needed to help them figure-out how to continue living with this loss are insurmountable. Anything helps and all donations are tremendously appreciated:https://gofund.me/0960fb2ePlease note: This does not mean that Carrie will not receive funds from this Go Fund Me, it just means she will receive additional funds dedicated to her individual recovery from the other fund started by Tina Pankow and managed by Carrie's family. As the needs of all 3 women continued to unveil themselves, I am working directly with point people representing each camp to ensure that all of them receive what they need. Additionally, all processing fees applied by Go Fund Me are being covered in effort to make sure that the recipients receive the full dollar amount intended from all donators.Fund Allocation Info: As of March 19th, 2021 per the requirements of Go Fund Me, the following information must be disclosed to all contributors to ensure transparency of how the funds will arrive in the hands of the victims it has been raised for. I, Gwendolyn Dailey, am a friend of Isha Clark, Carrie Lindley and Jessica Smith and per an agreement I have with each of their representatives, I will be withdrawing the funds directly into my personal bank account and dispersing it among the three via their direct bank accounts; in Isha's case, her daughter has had an account established for her, an account has been specifically established for Carrie for Go Fund Me funds and Jessica will have the money wired directly to her. The reason for withdrawing the funds in this manner is because the funds traditionally have to be withdrawn to one account and it must be by someone who the fund is for. Since Isha has passed and Carrie is not in a condition to handle this task, that would leave the burden on Jessica. After discussing it with their representatives it was decided not to leave this responsibility with Jessica who is handling enough, and that it would be easiest for me to handle the administrative task of withdraw and disbursement of funds.Read more"

But in the last 10 months she has undergone 5 surgeries, 4 of which were emergent and I know this has put her under a lot of emotional and physical duress. Most of it revolved around the financial burden of having had so many doctors appointments, tests, surgeries, hospital stays and procedures. Even when she is going through her roughest of times, she puts herself out there for her friends and community, never asking for anything in return. Although she would never ask for help, I know Pamela needs it and that’s where I’m hoping our efforts can come into play. I hope we can band together to ease the burden on such a beautiful soul.BackgroundIn early 2016, my really good friend Pamela Horton was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome. Lynch Syndrome, also known as Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (HNPCC) is a genetic mutation that she was born with that predisposes her to many types of cancer. Lynch Syndrome has a few different mutations and hers is one of the rarer ones. With this genetic disorder, she has a higher chance than the general population to develop colon, ovarian and endometrial cancer among a long list of others. In January 2018 she underwent a prophylactic total hysterectomy and salpingectomy to reduce her chances of getting endometrial cancer. The decision was made due to a personal history of cancer and unsolved issues with her endometrium. After this surgery, Pam continued to have complications with pain and a “pulling sensation” whenever she stood up or went to the bathroom. Tests showed no scar tissue and no attachments to the bladder, where the pain was centered.In late March, while travelling abroad for a convention, she suddenly began bleeding and was rushed to the emergency room. It was there she discovered her hysterectomy scar had not only healed to her colon, but her vault incision suffered from dehiscence. Because of this she had to have an emergency surgery at a hospital in Amsterdam. While coming off the heels of her second surgery, on July 3rd, she started feeling intense pains in her lower right abdomen. Fearing appendicitis, Pamela went to the ER where it was discovered she had a large mass originating from her right ovary. Due to her Lynch Syndrome diagnosis, she was told it was potentially cancerous and that all that could be done was pain management until she could see an oncologist after the 4th of July. For two days she sat in intense pain in a hospital with a 9cm cyst that had caused her ovary to twist, cutting off blood flow. Because doctors at the hospital requested no additional tests be done to confirm her diagnosis, Pamela transferred hospitals to a trusted doctor where she was taken in for another immediate emergency surgery. Unfortunately, the ovarian torsion had gone untreated for too long. Due to a misdiagnosis, Pam lost her right ovary. Fortunately, the mass that had caused the torsion was not cancerous, but the damage had been done. For the months following she endured a lot of hormonal changes in addition to the recovery process of a surgery. But, she finally felt she was in the clear.Since Pamela is only 30 years old, her doctor felt it was important that she keep her remaining ovary and that they keep an intense look out for any future signs of cysts that could potentially cause torsion or eventually become cancerous.In early September, Pam began to feel the exact same pain she felt before her last surgery, this time on the left side. She was immediately brought into the emergency room where she was given an ultrasound to find another very large 9cm+ cyst on her left ovary. She was wheeled in for another emergency surgery. Her left ovary had also twisted, but the doctor was able to remove the cyst and save the ovary and attempt to prevent future torsion by suturing the ovary in place. To prevent anymore cysts, Pamela was put on birth control and felt confidently that was the end of her rollercoaster of a medical journey.Unfortunately, life doesn’t always like to work that way. In the middle of October, Pamela began to feel the same pain again. She was rushed to the ER where they discovered she had another cyst, but it was too small to cause the pain, had not caused any torsion. To figure out why she was in pain, she spent a week in the hospital where she had episodes of intense pain. With all the invasive surgeries and complications, Pamela’s pelvic floor muscles were spasming and seizing almost constantly. Without being able to do physical therapy (due to pelvic rest after her many surgeries), she has been in constant pain since her first surgery in January. To help alleviate the pain until she could be treated in physical therapy, Pamela had another minor surgery to block the nerves to her pelvic floor.She has had 5 surgeries in the past 10 months and it has taken a toll on her emotionally and financially. Due to her medical issues, she has been unable to work, but still uses her time to inspire her followers and raise awareness on self care and advocate for genetic testing for things like Lynch Syndrome. If you were to meet Pamela you would know that she is one of the kindest and sweetest people in the world. She is the type of person who loves to make people smile and works hard to be there for her friends and followers. She is always the first person to offer help to those that need it and would never ask for help herself. But, I know the medical bills are piling up for her and cause her a lot of stress, especially because her recovery has made it hard to work. You would hardly know it with how she makes an effort to make others smile and feel appreciated so that why I’m asking on her behalf. Any contributions to help reduce the burden of her medical stresses would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.Read more"

He may have served in the Marine Corps with you, made sure you got home safe, jammed with you, provided a shoulder for you to cry on, handled off-the-wall customer requests with you, bought you in on a round of shots, spent hours discussing philosophy, science, or religion with you, or, at the very least, acknowledged your humanity and reminded you that you are valued, loved, and worthy; quite probably some combination of any of the above.On Monday, September 28th, Mike set out once again from Ames for a long series of days working to help homeowners and their insurance companies identify and understand the damages to their property as a result of the Derecho on August 10th. While far from home on his first inspection of the day, he fell from the second story of a house.Miraculously, Mike did not land on his head. He did not have a concussion.He did not break his hips. He did not break any of the bones in his feet or legs which helped to break his fall. The only major injury he sustained was a burst T12 vertebra. Which, admittedly, isn’t great - the vertebra was shattered. That, coupled with some bruising of the spinal cord and irritated nerves caused him a tremendous amount of pain. The cover photo for this campaign is that brilliant smiling face we know and love - over four hours after the fall and with zero pain mitigation whatsoever. Mike's first action upon falling, after being assured that the homeowner was calling 911, was to call me at work and tell me he ""had a little accident."" He managed to convey that the fall was bad without completely sending me into a panic. Within minutes, I left work, arranged care for our dogs, and started the 1.5 hour journey to the emergency room Mike was initially taken to. When I arrived, Mike was receiving the diagnostic imaging which confirmed that he would need specialty care beyond what the team there could handle.After being transferred via ambulance to Iowa Methodist in Des Moines (pictured above), he was met by the best neurosurgeon Iowa has to offer. With the confidence that only experience can bring, we were assured that his broken spine, while acute, was perfectly manageable. Recovery not only seemed possible, but perfectly likely!One of our greatest challenges during this time was our separation: Iowa Methodist is not allowing guests or visitors due to the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic. With the exception of a few precious moments before and after surgery, Mike navigated the challenges of recovery in a hospital without his support network physically by his side. I am grateful for the advantages of modern technology which made the distance seem not quite so vast, but being unable to be his support in person was excruciating.The surgeon devised a plan to address the shattered vertebra and the entire trauma team operated on Mike on Friday, October 2nd. Surgery was quick and smooth, lasting just under an hour. We learned that Mike has a particularly strong reaction to a certain anesthetic which caused an extreme bout of terror as he came to from the surgery. Even with that surprise, he soon was back to his normal ineffable sense of optimism, reassuring his entire family that everything was going to be fine. I’ve been told the nurses loved him for the kindness he showed them and the silly jokes he cracked!He took his first steps in the hospital after the accident on Saturday morning, barely 24 hours after being on the operating table.After a long weekend of recovery, and just over a week after the fall, Mike came home the night of Monday, October 5th. He arrived a little worse for wear and with a little “extra baggage” in tow. But, by that time, he was already able to walk with assistance and could even manage stairs for a short duration of time! His pain is intense but he is consistently working through it and improving every day. Using a walker, he is able to navigate the ground floor of our home. We are both sleeping on the couches downstairs, scheduling our sleeping and waking hours around pain management.We have follow up appointments to help determine just how well Mike’s recovery process is going. It seems reasonably likely that he will recover to a majority of his previous functionality. He is growing stronger by the day and continues to make vast strides towards establishing mobility and improving his chances of a fuller recovery. We know that Mike is extremely fortunate to have made it through this accident as well as he has! He is able to be home and we are mostly able to manage his home care ourselves. I am not sure who was more excited when Mike finally returned home: him or the dogs!This accident, as most do, came at an inopportune time. Mike has grappled with health problems for the majority of 2020, which led to him leaving his bartending job at Cafe Beaudelaire in February. Wrestling with unemployment and his sense of self-worth during the spring and summer months made it feel so much more of a victory when Mike returned to insurance adjusting in August. One of the downfalls of being an independent insurance adjustor, however, is that there is no employer to provide health insurance. Mike is uninsured.Even before Mike went into surgery, we received medical bills for his care. We are expecting his medical bills alone to total more than $50,000. In addition to the mounting bills, I, his wife, have had to take time off of work to care for him. The costs for supplies for home care have been mounting as well. There is also the question of when -- or, realistically, if -- Mike can return to work. A minimum of four months is necessary for rehabilitation from this surgery. It is quite possible that he will never return to climbing around roofs again. (I would much prefer that he never set foot on a roof or ladder again!)We never anticipated finding ourselves joining the chorus of uninsured people asking for help. We would usually never ask for help. Bills continue to arrive every day and the ongoing care Mike will need over the course of the next year as he recovers from this accident will be costly. The ever increasing debt is suffocating but we know we can recover from this horrible accident with a little help from our friends.One of my favorite moments from this all is Mike settling in on the couch, doing his best to find the most comfortable position his body would allow him. He asked me to hand him my little parlor guitar and, though he hasn’t played in months, began to play “Hallelujah.” I have never heard a sweeter tune in my entire life.Thank you for taking the time to read our story. We hope love and light find you in these uncertain times.Read more"

Just a few short months ago, our beautiful friend Jayde received some devastating, and very unexpected news.

We were all shattered to hear that this beautiful soul had been diagnosed with breast cancer 



Since that time, Jayde has undergone intense, regular chemo sessions, attended appointment after appointment with her surgical and breast care teams all whilst still working, going to the gym 5 times a week and always putting her family first ‍‍‍, determined to make sure her precious children don't miss out on anything 



For anyone who knows Jayde, she is a mother of two beautiful girls, wife to her rock Ben, loyal daughter and sister, professional business woman who has always excelled in her industry, an esteemed sports woman and fierce competitor, a valued member of so very many communities and a friend to everyone who meets her.



Jayde has determination like no other, she is a role model to all those around her, one of the most generous people you will ever meet, a shoulder to cry on and wise beyond her years.



Jayde has almost finished her chemotherapy treatments and will soon need to undergo surgery to remove a lump in her breast, a double mastectomy and then a breast reconstruction. This is not only a quite complex procedure, the recovery period is extensive and very expensive.



Jayde has touched so many of our lives, so we ask from the bottom of our hearts to please help us by donating to support Jayde and her family in post operative care.

No matter how big or small, every cent counts and will mean the world to our Wonder Woman as she bravely embarks on the next step of her journey.

I've been told I'm funny, sassy, good-natured, caring, empathetic, quick-witted, open-minded, carefree, loving and very appreciative of life. At the beginning of 2016, I was living a normal, productive life and so excited for the year ahead of me. I was celebrating such things like finishing my education, my nephew Marshall's 1st Birthday, and my Dad's offical retirement. These memorable occasions were definitely the finer moments in life. Little did I know that my life, my health, and my world were about to be flipped upside down.Many people ask me, how did this whole situation all begin? In January of this past year, I was having some digestive issues. At first, I thought it was just the typical growing pains, eating the wrong foods, or a stomach bug. After taking some over the counter medications that did not work, I decided to visit my Primary Care Physician who was concerned. He ordered a CT scan of my abdomen and the results had shown some sort of mass or tumor in my recto-sigmoid colon. I was then referred to a Gastro-intestinal Doctor who had ordered a colonscopy. During the colonscopy, the GI doctor biopsied a part of the tumor. I will never forget those words ""You have stage 4 colorectal cancer"" on March 3rd, 2016. I was at my follow up appointment with the GI doctor with my Dad when I had heard those life-changing words. My Dad of all people. Let me explain...he had lost his Father, his Brother, and his Mom all within the past 2 years. He hid it well, but I'm sure this was the last thing he ever wanted to hear: now his oldest Son was sick.From this point forward, I began the most difficult journey I have ever been on. I got to know my Oncologist, his staff, and Nurses very well. He said ""the next year of your life will be the most difficult., but we'll get through it."" I have had multiple CT Scans, multiple MRIs, mulitple PET scans, and many other procedures that aren't exactly comfortable. I also had a chemotherapy port installed under my right clavicle so that I wouldn't have to have my chemo injections done through my arm veins (for fear of collasping). My treatment plan since last March consisted of the following:1- Chemotherapy2- Radiation3- Surgeries (There will be 2)4- Final ChemotherapyI am currently at step 3, and my first surgery is Friday, 12/2. This will be the most difficult and challenging of all the steps, both physically AND mentally. After I am healed from the surgeries, I will then begin my last rounds of chemotherapy. Hopefully, when that is completed, I can be pronounced ""Cancer free"".My purpose of starting this GoFundMe account was to create awareness about my health through updates on my treatments and progress. Regretfully, I will not be able to work for at least 2 months due to the nature of the first surgery and the recovery time involved. I am hoping by starting this account, it will help ease the financial burden by missing so much work. My goal is set to raise money that will assist me with my health and medical bills. We all know that even with insurance, healthcare costs can accumulate over time, especially with someone battling Cancer.After reading my GoFundMe page and you are considering donating, please remember that no donation is too small and anything is very much appreciated.I want to thank everyone in my life for their kindness, love and phenomenal support throughout my Cancer journey. The good in people really shines in someones' time of need. I am so blessed to have such amazing family, friends, and coworkers by my side. I especially want to thank my Partner Angelo, my Parents David and Janice, my Brother Matt and his wife Kayla, my niece Lexie and nephews Marshall and Graysen for being the best support system anyone could ask for! YOU ALL are the reason to keep fighting! Thank you everyone for taking the time to read my page. #SIMYAKSTRONGRead more"

His father, Chris Ralph, rushed him to the Sunshine Coast University Hospital (SCUH) Emergency Ward, worried that Preston had an appendicitis or similar illness. Nothing could have prepared him for what the next 72 hours would hold…By 10.00am that morning, Doctors at SCUH advised Chris that lesions had been found on Preston’s liver, and possibly represented a symptom of some form of cancer. Preston required immediate, further investigation at Brisbane’s Queensland Children’s Hospital (QCH). By noon on the same day, Preston was in an ambulance being transported to QCH in Brisbane and was taken directly to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) to provide specialised care, and to monitor his function under the strain of his illness, prepared to be put on Dialysis if needed. While still in ICU on Monday 1 February, Doctor’s at QCH confirmed what everybody had feared – Preston had cancer, though they remained unsure of the exact diagnosis. Preston continued to have blood tests every two hours and numerous lumber punctures and a bone marrow test to not only monitor his health, but to determine the type of cancer that plagued him.Tuesday 2 February, Chris and Preston finally had an answer – Preston was formally diagnosed with B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, and treatment needed to be started immediately.So, what is the prognosis? While he has now been transferred from ICU to the Oncology Ward at QCH, Preston requires at least six months treatment. He started Grade 8 at Coolum State High School on Wednesday 27 January, and only seven days later he finds himself lying in a hospital bed, suffering through the many side effects of chemotherapy.During the first treatment cycle Preston told his Dad that he didn’t think he could do it (the treatment). His family knows he can. But there is one thing for certain – he needs his Father’s love and support throughout the entire journey.Chris is a single Dad, who naturally has given up work to be Preston’s full-time carer throughout his treatment and recovery. Although Chris and Preston live on the Sunshine Coast, Chris is determined to remain in Brisbane by his son’s side. While he may not be required to remain in hospital for the full six months, Preston is required to stay within 30 minutes of the hospital throughout his journey, meaning that Chris will also stay in Brisbane for however long it takes.This page has been set up to help Chris with everyday living expenses while he is not working throughout Preston’s treatment.

Because of the severity of his condition Ross has been placed on oxygen 24 hours a day which has left him unable to work until after a successful transplant and recovery. When Ross was a baby he was in and out of multiple hospitals,locally as well as in the Atlanta area. The diagnosis was interstitial lung disease, which is a disorder that causes scarring of the lungs. This lung disease has caused Pulmonary Hypertension which is the reason for the double lung transplant. Ross is currently in the process of being placed on the lung transplant list. Ross, his mother Joy Echols, his father Frank Echols, brothers Greer and Jacob Echols, girlfriend Kasey Barnes and other close relatives have been traveling to Atlanta for pre-transplant appointments, multiple tests, and treatments. Ross and Joy are required by the physicians to relocate to the Atlanta area for the year-long double lung transplant surgery and recovery.

The Blood Service plays an important role in the healthcare system by ensuring that patients in Australian hospitals receive life-saving blood products, delivering world-class research and provide expertise in diagnostic, transplantation and other clinical services. The Blood Service spent $576m in 2016, collecting and supplying 1.3m blood donations, with supplies remaining in inventory sufficiency bands for 339 days of the year. In 2015, Humanitarian Services spent $197.5m in delivery of humanitarian programs, emergency and disaster response. Most of our disaster and emergency work was carried out supporting the recovery from cyclone Winston in Fiji and the devastating earthquake in Nepal, the humanitarian crisis in Syria and the cyclone Pam in Vanuatu. We spent $180.8m on our everyday work to address disadvantage across Australia and overseas. Our program spend decreased from last year as a result driven by the down-sizing of our migrant support services. Our program activities within humanitarian services are defined according to our priority areas - Disaster and Emergency services, Locational disadvantage, Social Inclusion, International Aid and Development, International Humanitarian Law, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs and Migrant Support Services. Despite reduced government funds our spending on locational disadvantage and social inclusion increased this year.Read more"

It’s so rare that it only occurs in 1 in 3,000,000 babies. Despite the struggles, Caroline continues to exude joy and happiness on a daily basis.Caroline is about to have her 6th brain surgery (embolization) on April 28th in 2 years in New York. Caroline was an extremely late diagnosis, and thus, has had many complications. Brian and Megan have used up all of their sick days to care for Caroline--pre and post surgery, therapies, and travel.Caroline’s first surgery resulted in an ischemic stroke of her thalamus. This led to a cerebral palsy diagnosis as well, and having to go to intensive neuro-rehabilitation which continues to this day to recover and do her best to keep up with her peers.On April 28th Caroline has her 6th brain surgery. Caroline’s team of doctors, nurses, social workers, and therapists have been incredible--truly heroes--watching Caroline endure multiple procedures and rounds of recovery has taken much strength and faith. To make the situation even more heartbreaking in this trying time, due to COVID-19 restrictions only one parent can stay with Caroline in the hospital.  COVID-19 also made Ronald McDonald House not an option for the Gross family in New York.On top of that, Dr. Bernstein is one of a few doctors to treat Vein of Galen Malformation. This world renowned surgeon is out of their insurance network and does not accept the insurance through Brian and Megan’s schools. Insurance has denied each of the previous surgeries and doesn’t pay the $103,000 doctor bill each surgery.  Brian and Megan have spent two years appealing the first surgery to only lose all of the appeals.The donations will go towards Caroline’s 6th surgery hotel stay, travel, ubers to the hospital, and food. Also future items, further surgeries or yearly checkups. As well as hospital, doctor, anesthesia bills, therapies and adaptive equipment to support Caroline.A true warrior, Caroline has been through so much in her young years.  There is something about her that makes this world a better place.  When you hear Caroline’s story it's heartbreaking but when you meet Caroline it's heartwarming. This girl will love you with her whole heart.  She’ll be the one to comfort you when you're sad.  She’ll be the one to make you laugh when you need it the most.  Instead of thinking about her tough challenges she faces, she's thinking about how she can help you.  I truly think if everyone could meet Caroline and spend the day with her, their heart would be filled with little more love and kindness.  Please help us to support Caroline in her fight for her life.https://www.mountsinai.org/care/neurosurgery/services/pediatric-cerebrovascular-disorders/vein-galen-malformationsPlease help the Gross family with as much as you can.Love,The family of Brian and MeganRead more"

On March 1, 2021 around 8:30 pm, my brother Elijah experienced a house explosion in his home in Frederick, MD. He was 5 feet away when the explosion occurred in his basement. He suffered 2nd degree burns on his arms, chest, legs, feet and face equaling to 23% skin loss. He was transported immediately to John Hopkins Bayview Burn Center. He underwent lots of treatment and one surgery. After a 2 week stay at thehospital, he was discharged and has a long recovery ahead of him. He still has a hard time walking and much healing ahead of him . Unfortunately, his home is vacated so he currently cannot go back to his house.

I’ve created this GoFundMe account to help with meals, medical bills and unexpected expenses for him and his girlfriend Evelyn. If you can help or donate any amount. We are very appreciative. Everyone’s thoughts and prayers have truly helped him push through this. Thank you everyone.

Marty is suffering from severe disability due to the long-term effects of a brain aneurysm and from the excruciating pain associated with Trigeminal Neuralgia (AKA the ""suicide disease""). Marty’s medical conditions forced him into an unexpected, early retirement, without Long-Term Disability Payments. We are asking for your help to fulfill two immediate needs: (1) Financial Assistance in order to immediately make his home handicap accessible.(2) Guidance and Advice on how Marty can successfully reinstate his Long-Term Disability Insurance.Background: Marty suffered an undiagnosed deep brain aneurysm that left him in a coma for 5 months. Upon waking from his coma, the aneurysm initially left him completely paralyzed on his right side and without the ability to speak. Doctors stated that he would never speak or walk again and that he would require a long-term care facility for the rest of his life. Through the same grit and determination Marty exhibited during his 4 years at The Citadel, Marty exceeded all expectations during a tough recovery and regained the ability to speak. After months of painful rehabilitation, Marty restored a small portion of his mobility. Marty even returned to work for a short period of time, but continued to face difficulties due to his debilitating condition. Despite his valiant efforts, Marty never achieved the level of recovery required to live a normal life. He is still severely disabled by his condition and may never return to the quality of life that he once enjoyed prior to the brain aneurysm.Marty has come a long way, but he still suffers from severe pain and has major mobility issues. His muscles involuntarily become so tight that his fingernails cut into his palms and his arms and legs swell to abnormal sizes. He is undergoing experimental treatment at a cost of $3,000 every three months. Marty was slowly progressing as planned until he faced another unforeseen medical challenge. As he regained the feeling in the right side of his face, Marty began suffering from acute facial pain – “It’s like having a knife buried in your cheek and brain with a feeling of fire on your nose and ear.” The pain in the face is followed by waves of electrical shock. Marty was eventually diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia, regarded as one of the most painful disorders known to the medical community. Concurrently, due to brain damage, Marty suffers from a locked ankle and hammer toes, resulting in foot infections, and the tear ducts in his eyes have ceased normal functioning.Given Marty’s long-term health conditions, he is in the process of fitting his home to accommodate his handicaps. But, he is unable to finish the projects due to the recent loss of his Long-Term Disability Insurance. The insurance company claims that his condition is ""pre-existing"". Marty now faces the uphill battle of fighting for his disability insurance, fighting for the means to receive crucial medical treatment, and fighting for needed surgery.Marty is not one to ask for help, but rather the first to help others.

Hey guys!! This is a picture of my cousins 4 year old puppy Pokey. 3 years ago my younger cousin rescued him from an abusive home and has turned his life around for the better. He is now 4 years old and has been living an energetic healthy and full life until this past Friday. He unfortunately fell sick after swallowing too large of a bone that has now blocked and has stopped his intestines from allowing the break down process in order for pokey to pass the bone. He hasn’t eaten for days, he has become very dehydrated,distant, is not himself at all and is unable to even keep water down. He is currently in a Toronto animal hospital on IVs and is receiving multiple diagnostic testing daily. As of right now they have been keeping an eye on the bone and hoping the medication helps in order to help begin to start to even break down but, if this doesn’t work...in order to keep him alive and to recover from this, surgery will be needed to remove it. My cousin Chris is a 21 year old student who is working hard in the middle of his electrician apprenticeship and would appreciate any amount of help. We all know how expensive vet bills are so I’ve started this gofundme in hopes of helping settle the ease of some bills along Pokeys recovery!

Every little bit counts and if you knew Chris, you would know how much Pokey means tohim and our entire family.

thank you!!!!

As many of you know, Christa was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer in June 2020. So far in her battle she has underwent two lumpectomy surgeries (neither successfully took out all the cancer), two fertility retrieval procedures (freezing 34 eggs!) and is now receiving chemotherapy treatments. Her next surgeries will take place once her chemo treatments are over. A double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery are scheduled for 2021.Christa has been in and out of work since she was first diagnosed in June and has now been on an unpaid leave from work since the end of November. Unfortunately expenses of monthly bills, insurance, food and other necessities do not stop when you are hit with an illness like this. The loss of income and the extra medical expenses incurred will be an added stress factor we are looking to avoid. It is our goal to raise enough funds to cover these expenses to help relieve the stress and worry associated with the financial aspects of this disease, this way Christa and her family can focus on the task at hand - beating this cancer and getting Christa healthy!Read more"

After undergoing multiple corrective surgeries secondary to the fracture, infections, and anything else that could go wrong, about 9 months later that baby finally was cast and cone free! Now fast forward to last Monday when she began limping and crying throughout the day. After taking her to the vet to get X-rays completed, we were informed that Reese's femoral head detached from the hip due to the atrophy of the bone/leg. The femur has since rotated behind her pelvis and now is in need of another surgery. After a consultation with a veterinary orthopedic surgeon and doing research, Lisa and I have decided that the best option for Reese is amputation as opposed to a femoral head osteotomy (FHO). With amputation she will have to learn to live life as a ""tripod"" but will be able to get back to her normal self pretty quickly. The FHO will be a lengthy recovery and not a guarantee solution in the long run which would result in an amputation.We have never done a ""Gofundme"" before as we have never wanted to ask people for money or burden anyone else with the financial obligation of Reese's surgeries; however, this surgery is extremely expensive and we need the help. Unfortunately, the cost of her amputation is appx. $2600.00 and since Reese has no money because she refuses to get a job, her mommmies are responsible for the bill on the day of surgery which is tomorrow (9-25-17).Lisa and I are asking for help in this unfortunate situation.

Shortly after, he fainted and was immediately rushed to the hospital. It was discovered that Aaron has a condition in his brain known as Arterial Venus Malformation (AVM). AVM is a tangle of abnormal blood vessels connecting arteries and veins in the brain.The arteries are responsible for taking oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the brain. Veins carry the oxygen-depleted blood back to the lungs and heart. A brain AVM disrupts this vital process.Right now Aaron is in stable condition and has very limited use of body functions. He currently has a drainage tube from his head. The doctors at Nicklaus Children's Hospital have removed the tubes from his mouth, and will conduct an angiogram to determine the severity of the damage done to his brain.Aaron has undergone brain surgery to stabilize his injury, and is awaiting the next step for the best course of treatment. This can include radiation, injection of a glue, and/or another surgery. While there is no question in our minds that Aaron will beat this with great strength. It is anticipated that he will be subject to possible brain surgery along with other treatment plans.During this time, Aaron and his supporting family will be spending a lot of time at the hospital. The Atesiano family will likely be facing high medical expenses. With great urgency, we have created this page for the Atesiano family to allow them to focus on what's most important at this time, which is supporting Aaron and being together as a family.

Here is our story, so far...Addison (Addi) Jane Sammons was born February 28th, 2021 to Parker and Alanna Sammons 4 weeks early. Alanna left work early Friday (2/26) to go to her OB because she noticed her blood pressure was higher than normal. She had been expressing concerns about her blood pressure and swelling to her doctor for several weeks at this point, but he convinced her she did not have pre-eclampsia. He put her off work until delivery to relieve stress but not strict bed rest.On Saturday (2/27) Parker and Alanna drove to Bristol for one last visit with family before travel restrictions set in for the last month of pregnancy. Around midnight Saturday night, Alanna woke up, as she described it, in the worst pain of her life. She was experiencing the right upper quadrant pain that they warn you about with Pre-E. She did everything she knew possible to relieve the pain but nothing was helping. She checked her blood pressure and it was 212/114. She called her doctor in Chattanooga, and they told her to go to the nearest emergency room.They went to Bristol Regional around 6 am on Sunday (2/28). Within an hour of arriving at the hospital, they were told Addi Jane would be coming that day. Alanna's blood pressure was dangerously high, her blood work was all over the place, and she was finally diagnosed with Pre-eclampsia with severe features. They moved her to a room, started magnesium, antibiotics, and Pitocin. Thankfully, her labor was quick, given the circumstances, and she delivered their precious girl, Addi, at 10:51pm. She weighed 3lbs 14oz and was 17 1/4 inches long.Once Addi was here, they realized she was small for gestational age, and Alanna's placenta was also smaller than to be expected. Addi stayed in the nursery the first night at the hospital because of being in a special bed to keep her warm.On Monday morning (3/1) the doctors came in Alanna's room and told her they made the decision to transfer Addi to Niswonger Children’s Hospital in Johnson City, Tennessee because she didn’t quite weigh enough for a car seat. They were told she would stay for one week max to gain weight and then come home. That night Parker stayed at the hospital with Addi until Alanna could be discharged the next morning.Tuesday morning (3/2) Addi’s heart unexpectedly stopped and she coded while feeding. Addi was placed on a ventilator and remained in critical yet stable condition while the doctors searched for the cause. The doctors began running multiple test to try and understand why this had occurred. Later that day they learned that Addi had a disease called Necrotizing Enterocolitis. She was very very sick.The doctors pulled Alanna and Parker in a room that night and told them if Addi’s bowel perforated during the night, she would need emergency surgery. Surgery that she probably wouldn’t survive because she was so unstable. Alanna said, ""My entire body broke in that moment. No mother should ever be told their new baby might die."" Addi made it through the night, and the doctors were able to get her more stabilized before the bowel perforated the next day. On Wednesday (3/3) afternoon, Addi went to surgery where they removed approximately 2/3 of the small intestines. Because of this, she now has 3 stomas on her belly. In 6-8 weeks the surgeons will take her back to surgery with the goal of reconnecting the intestines and placing them back inside.Each day Addi is improving and getting stronger. She is truly their little miracle baby, but they still have a long road ahead of them. The doctors estimate they will be in the NICU about 12 weeks. Addi is currently on TPN for IV nutrition. Two days ago (3/12) they began also feeding her a very small amount (1mL/hr) of breastmilk continuously through a feeding tube. As Addi tolerates the milk, they increase the feeding amount. Their prayer is that Addi will tolerate the feeds up to our goal and is able to go home just consuming milk by mouth. There is a possibility however that Addi could come home on TPN / tube feeds. If that is the case, they will have a home health nurse that comes to the house to help with these things. Addi will have a GI doctor follow her for the rest of her life.Parker and Alanna ask that everyone join them and continue praying for their sweet girl, for the doctors/surgeons, as well as for mom and dad. This is not an easy road and no parent should ever have to see their child go through this. Alanna said, and I quote: ""My arms ache to have my baby home with me.""Thankfully, Addi is now on a long road to recovery. This recovery process normally requires 2 - 3 additional surgeries with 3-4 months in NIC Unit at Children’s Hospital. With this kind of diagnosis and ongoing surgeries comes the reality of unforeseen medicals bills. Parker and Alanna will also have travel and food costs as Addi is at an out of town hospital not local to them. Also, time away from work for the care of the baby will create a huge financial hardship for this new little family.Will you be Addi's lifeline and help with expenses? Our goal is $25,000.I adapted this information from a post made by Parker and Alanna as it best captures the details:Thank you in advance for helping offset this expense for this new family and their first child in their first year of marriage.Read more"

This is less that one weekend of fun, but will give Rowdy a healthy, pain free life for many years to come. Due to Blue Cross denying his claim, after this surgery was deemed the only option for Rowdy by the Mayo Clinic and University of Minnesota. Blue Cross has stated that he needs to pursue other options, we have explored all options available and the Mayo clinic has tested him intensively.  All the specialists from the Mayo Clinic and University of Minnesota were in agreement that this is his only option.  He has suffered with this genetic condition since he was 12 and is affecting his quality of life. He is only 20 years old and has lived a life of pain for way to long.  He lives in constant pain, stress and anxiety of when the next attack will happen. His abdominal walls have already been destroyed from all the attacks he has suffered. His pancreas creates to much lipase, the enzyme that breaks down protein. It floods his system and eats away at his muscles.  The nerve endings have been left bare, therefore causing the nerves to constantly fire and causes great pain.  If this is not dealt with it will progress into pancreatic cancer at a rapid rate. We have been to multiple doctors and specialists and this is the first time he has had any hope for a pain free life. The recovery will be long, but will give him relief from the pain. He is scheduled for this procedure on March 5th, but if he does not have the funds available before then, the surgery will be canceled. I am trying to help Rowdy Joe Piva raise money for a total Pancreatomy and islet transplant. Rowdy was diagnosed with genetic pancreatitis in November of 2019 and has spent multiple weeks in the hospital and countless trips to the emergency room since then. He goes to the emergency room 1-2 times a month to help him with the severity of the pain and the rapid advancement of the attacks. With increasing severity of the attacks, his trips to the ER are becoming more frequent. The ducts in the pancreas are becoming torqued and causing the the pain to increase. In November of 2020 he went to the Mayo clinic, after several days of intensive testing this procedure was recommended as the only option for Rowdy to get any relief from the pain he has been dealing with since he was in junior high. After the surgery he will remain in ICU for 7-10 days, then the hospital for 10 days then must stay in Minneapolis for 4-6 weeks for continual monitoring. He will have to be on enzymes for the rest of his life and will eventually become diabetic, but this is still a much better option than pancreatic cancer, that has no cure. He is one of the youngest candidates for this procedure and doctors all feel that his youth and willingness to take care of this problem make him a prime candidate for the surgery. He has been very proactive in dealing with his condition, has done all of the things that doctors have asked of him and wants nothing more than relief of constant pain and suffering.I Jace Abatti will start this with a $1000 donation of my own money, lets get this rolling and get him get the help he needs.Read more"

On Saturday July 20, 2019 the Wisconsin Rapids area was hit with severe storms that caused major damage throughout town. My husband Brian Ortner is a lineman for the local telephone company and was called out to work. As I understand it, he was clearing debris off of telephone lines when the limb swung and hit him in the back. Luckily the line he was trying to cut it off of kept the tree from completely pinning him to the ground or we most likely would have lost him. He immediately could not feel his legs. He was rushed to Marshfield by ambulance where we learned of his devastating injuries. He has an unstable T8 (thoracic) burst fracture that severed his spinal cord. He has a left femoral neck (hip) fracture, C6 (cervical) spinous process fracture, T9 & T10 transverse process fractures, left rib fractures 6-10, and the 7th right rib. Currently he feels nothing from the chest down and that will not change. The neurosurgeon told us that we are lucky that he is even alive. People with that severe of injury usually do not make it to the hospital, which is what makes Brian's surgery so risky. The bone of his spine is pressing on his aorta (the major blood vessel off your heart). He went into surgery this morning around 10am to stabilize his spine. We are told the surgery will take 8-10hrs. With that surgery comes the risk of his paralysis moving up to affect his diaphragm. If that is the case he will likely be sedated with a breathing tube for the next few days with the hope that the swelling would go down and he will be able to breath on his own again. He will also have an NG tube in his nose. The good news is they told us it is VERY unlikely that he would lose the use of his arms after this surgery. I am so greatful for that! It sounds like we will be here for the next 2-3 weeks and after that I need to try and get into a spinal cord injury rehab center. So far we have been told Denver is the best one. The reality of our situation is that our lives are forever changed from this moment on. The home that we have lived in for the past 15yrs, where we brought our babies home to will no longer be a home we can have. It is an old home that has 3 levels and too narrow of doorways for his wheelchair. And the icing on the cake is that today (surgery day) is our son Bennett's 8th birthday. This is not at all where we imagined we would be, but here we are. And I am sure there are many things in the future we can not foresee. Please pray for Brian today for him to make it out of this risky surgery safely, and pray for us all in the future as we learn to deal with this tragedy. Thank you for all of the thoughts, prayers, and offers to help. I don't like to ask for it, but we will need it. -Amy

At the end of January, Bill was diagnosed with colon cancer– or “cancer of the pooper” as he described it to his niece. His body is fighting, and some days are worse than others. Throughout this, he has fought to stay in the classroom, changing the lives of students through music, but with his surgery approaching on March 9, he will need anywhere from 4-6 weeks away from school to recover. 



In addition, he will need to receive chemotherapy in the months following the surgery. Time off from work will be a necessity for scheduling chemo treatments and recovery days. Mr. Guthrie is tough, a fighter, and we are ready to support him in this battle.



He is anticipating the cost of all pre-op, surgery, 2-4 days in the hospital, and 4-6 weeks out of work. Since many of us are teachers, we understand that financial savings are almost non-existent. This will be a monumental undertaking. Your donation, any donation,will help Bill and Michelle (his girlfriend who has been by his side through it all) take the time off from work needed for recovery and allow them the chance to breathe without the stress of bills.

Brian is a father, a singer and a career music educator, now in his 33rd year in the classroom. His music-making has touched the lives of countless students over the years. Mr. Vaughn loves to tell stories of his former students in order to inspire the ones who are in his classroom today. It’s amazing how he remembers so much about them to share!

Brian’s Cancer Story--

Mr. Vaughn's cancer was found through regular checkups and testing during his annual physical. When there was an alarming jump in the PSA level from one checkup to the next, he went for more rigorous testing. Those tests (DRE, TRUS, biopsy, MRI, bone scan) revealed a highly-aggressive form of prostate cancer; most prostate cancers are very slow-growing. In May of 2019, Brian had a robotic radical prostatectomy in order to get the cancer out and retain his personal functions through nerve-sparing techniques. The doctors did a great job with the surgery, and after three months, Mr. Vaughn was on the road to recovery and the cancer was undetectable. Unfortunately, the six months' post-op showed that the cancer had returned. There was a l-in-3 chance of recurrence within 5 years, but no one expected the crushing news that it was back so soon. Brian is now undergoing Androgen Deprivation Therapy to slow the growth of the cancer, leading up to 35 sessions of targeted radiation therapy later this Spring. The radiation oncologist has indicated an 80% chance of curing the cancer through these treatments.





Why Help Is Needed--

Employer-based insurance simply is not enough for catastrophic illnesses. Mr. Vaughn has a high-deductible plan with a Health Savings Account for himself and his two teenaged children, Erik and Marissa. Brian has exhausted the funds in two HSA accounts (he had one from a previous employer), and has depleted his modest savings, as well. It's time to face the music and admit that he can't do it alone.



How You Can Help--

Even the smallest donation of money will help pay those bills and dig the family out of the financial hole in which they find themselves. If you are personally connected with Mr. Vaughn, please share a story that will let others know what he has meant to you through making music together and the life lessons he has shared. Please help spread his story on social media to get the word out. If we all pull together, we can make this very difficult time easier on him and his family.

If you know Drew Current, then you've got at least one hilarious story to tell. More likely, you have more than you can count. He's one of those very rare people in this world who lives life in the present, enjoying every moment it has to offer.Unfortunately, on Oct. 27th, 2020 Drew Current experienced a massive stroke. Luckily, he was rushed to ER rapidly after the incident, but was unable to speak or move, and was only partially responsive to speech.As it is for all families when unexpected tragedy happens, things get overwhelming fast. In order to help him, his wife Amy, and his family, we are setting up fund raising to help cover the costs of not only medical bills, but also family travel, hotel, and general expenses that accrue during these difficult times.We will give you updates on this GoFundMe page as often as possible through the course of Drew's progress. Currently, it has been approximately 48 hours since Drew had his stroke. He had a surgery on Wed. Oct. 28th to alleviate edema of the brain. Unfortunately, it is a waiting game from surgery to 72 hours. The doctors will be watching for changes so that they can move forward with whatever therapy and rehabilitation he will need. What we do know, however, is that whatever rehab is needed, it will have its ass kicked by Drew, until the rehab itself needs rehab.Because of Covid-19, the family has not been able to be with Drew in person, but is face-timing with him to let him know that they are there.We cannot thank you enough for any donations you can spare, and please continue to send warm thoughts, prayers and healing vibes for a full, speedy recovery.

Feathers has been a staple of the LGBTQ+ community for 42 years. We have been home to thousands of people both patrons and entertainers, but times have changed. Feathers is now in danger of closing permanently. We have been closed for 4 months with no income due to the pandemic. We have struggled to stay afloat through this terrible time. As time goes on and with all the restrictions placed on us by the government for the safety and health of all of us, it has become clear that without everyone’s help we may have to close the doors forever.

Feathers opened its doors on June 21st,1978 when being gay was not widely accepted. We opened so that our community could have a safe place to call our own, we have championed for social acceptance and equality. We are the longest-running gay club still in existence in NJ today and only one of a few left. In good times and bad, Feathers has been the place to go. We have all laughed, danced, partied, and cried together as a community in this place we call home.



The Covid-19 global pandemic has taken so much from all of us. We now live in a changed reality and the future is hard to imagine without Feathers. Today, we are asking you to help save Feathers from closing its doors forever. We are facing an uncertain future and the road to recovery will be long and tough. Without your support, we will face a very bleak future.

Kim took him to the doctor several times, where he received a diagnosis of slipped discs and pneumonia, and was warned of the possible need for back surgery in the future. However, on Thanksgiving day, Justin's back pain intensified, and the two found themselves back in the ER for more testing. A chest X-ray revealed the heart-wrenching news: Justin has aggressive lung cancer that has already spread to his lymph nodes and bones. Justin started radiation on Thursday, and chemotherapy on Friday. His doctors are hopeful that these aggressive approaches will be successful in treating the cancer; however, Justin has a very long road to recovery ahead of him, regardless.Justin and Kim have three children, all under the age of five. Kim also recently discovered she is two months pregnant with their fourth baby. Justin is a loving father and an incredibly hard worker; he is also the main provider for the family. He has been out of work for over a month, due to back pain from what they now know is cancer. Kim recently left her job as an 8th grade teacher to be a stay at home mom to their three children. She taught for six years in the Woodland School District and was a favorite amongst many of her previous students and colleagues. Kim is an incredibly generous and loving person; she supported and encouraged many during her time in the WSD.Let’s rally around Kim and her family to show them how many people love and support them during this time of immense need. The holidays can be a challenging time for many -- anything, no matter how small, helps. Gift-cards to local restaurants would also be greatly appreciated, as Kim is currently driving to Sunnyside on a daily basis.

He is a typical 6 year old boy in that he loves his superheroes (Thor is his favourite) playing with LEGO , dressing up as all different superhero’s , enjoys playing with his friends and being social. Connor also happens to have cerebral palsy CP that he will live with the rest of his life.Cerebral palsy is the number one physical disability in children and is often a result of a brain injury around the time of birth. Connor was born 13 weeks premature at 27 weeks gestation, weighing only 2.7 lbs (1100g) and began his journey in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The very first few days were very scary as doctors were uncertain if he would survive the first 48 hrs. His lungs were so underdeveloped he was placed on an oscillator jet to help him breathe over the next couple of weeks. During this time Connor wasn’t able to be held and touching was to be at a minimum because of how sensitive his skin was. During this time doctors were keeping, a close eye on his head circumference as the size of his head was growing faster then it should have. After many head ultrasounds, it was discovered Connor had suffered bilateral grade 3&4 brain bleeds resulting in hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a condition in which an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid occurs within the brain. This typically causes increased pressure inside the skull. It was determined that Connor would need surgery to place a VP shunt to help with the draining of the fluid buildup due to the hydrocephalus. The the major concern was he was still too little and weak to undergo such a surgery and doctors decided it was best to continue to monitor his head circumference on Week to week basis until he was both strong and big enough to undergo the surgery. Just over a month, after he was born Connor was transferred to sick kids hospital where he was to have brain surgery to have a VP shunt placed but a week before his surgery date Connor got very sick and it was discovered he had developed necrotizing enterocolitis (“NEC”) which can be deadly for premature babies. “NEC” is a devastating disease that affects mostly the intestine of premature infants. Bacteria invade the wall of the intestine, which causes local infection and inflammation that can ultimately destroy the wall of the bowel. Luckily, the nurses and doctors at Sick Kids Hospital discovered this quick enough and it was able to be treated with just medication. Finally, after 120 days in the NICU Connor was finally well enough to be able to come home!Due to Connor born prematurely he was placed on waiting lists for early intervention as he was a much higher risk for having CP. when Connor was 8 months old he started physiotherapy and occupational therapy. At 12 months, he was diagnosed with right side Hemiplegia cerebral palsy meaning the right side of his body is effected by spasticity. Messages from damaged parts of his brain are causing his muscles to continuously contract, which is spasticity. He refers to his right hand and leg as his “weaker” ones. Every time he grows it’s a challenge to keep his tight spastic muscles stretched enough to keep up with his growing bones and hopefully prevent deformities and contracture for s long as possible.Over the last 6 years, Connor has had countless hours of physio/occupational therapy and other therapies, being fitted for AFOs (ankle foot orthotics) and painful Botox injections (to weaken the spastic muscles). Even with all these therapies and treatments Connor still needs assistance doing regular day today tasks, such going up and downstairs, walking on uneven surfaces, and his balance is also affected. Even at 6 years old, he is starting to notice the difference between himself and other kids his age. He is unable to run or jump like other kids his age and he gets very frustrated and often asks why he cannot do what they do. As he gets older these differences in abilities between him and other children his age will only get bigger.People with CP age early, live with chronic pain and develop joint deformities over time. Even children considered “mild” like Connor will see their mobility decline in the teens, 20s or 30s.As like any parent, our sons’ future and quality of life are always on our minds. Although it seems so far away grownup CP issues are a major concern for us as we want him to live the best possible pain free and independent life he can. As he gets older and the increasing limits to his mobility and his realization of his differences of them are daily reminders of the obstacles that still face him currently and in the future are a struggle.Connor has been accepted for a surgery called selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) which is performed by renowned neurosurgeon Dr. Park at St. Louis children’s hospital. This surgery will dramatically change Connors life in the best way possible. Connor has been beating the odds from the beginning and does so with a smile on his face, he is a fighter, warrior and he does not let anything stop him or get in his way. Miracles really do happen and Connor is one of those miracles.Item - Cost (CDN) Treatment in St. LouisSDR Surgery & in hospital recovery$ 65,000.00 PERCS (orthopedic surgery)*$ 16,000.00 Mobility equipment (braces, walkers, crutches etc.)$ 8,000.00 Travel Expenses and Accommodation in St. Louis$ 11,000.00 Pre/Post-Operative Therapy $ 35,000.00 TOTAL$ 135,000.00Read more"

Steve was known for his humor, gentle spirit and love of all sports.Steve was visiting in Bristol, TN in October 2016 when he noticed that he could not read the menu in a local restaurant.The words were recognizable but the order in the sentence was not. Par for the course, Steve ordered a hamburger and kept his confusion of words to himself. The following morning, he had a severe episode of vertigo which sent him to the local emergency room in Bristol. Originally thought to be a stroke, Steve was admitted that day for further stroke evaluation.Following an MRI and brain biopsy, Steve was told he had a very aggressive and lethal brain cancer known as glioblastoma multi forme. Glioblastoma requires immediate treatment and Steve was advised to go toThe Preston Robert TischBrain TumorCenter at Duke in Durham, North Carolina. HisRadiationoncologist andNeuro oncologist told Steve the battle against glioblastoma is an ""uphill climb."" He began a regimen of 33 brainradiation treatments along with 42 days of chemotherapy at Duke and has just finished a second round of chemotherapy. Following future MRI results, Duke willl detemine what next steps are necessary to fight this deadly brain cancer. Duke Cancer Center has a variety of clinical trials and treatments for glioblastoma as well as an individualized approach for the patient.

To fight this cancer and to give Steve a chance of recovery is going to be expensive and ongoing. His future medical care willcontinue at Duke. It is difficult to determine what he will need financially at this time, but it is assumed it willbe a financial and heavy burden on him. Steve has always known this storm he is in, is in God's hands. He continues to praise God for his faithfulness and intimate care which has been witnessed so many times since his diagnosis. He believes in a miraculous healing and is entrusting God with that request. Steve also knows that God may choose to heal him on earth or heal him eternally. In the meantime, the battle is on!Steve has many friends. If you are one of those friends, please consider a small donation to assist with thestaggering costs of this disease and treatment.

My name is Lou Montgomery. I am Tina's nephew. I figured the best way I can help this situation, is to helplessen her financial burden, other than prayer of course.
As you may know, Tina has been diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). While I believe her prognosis remains good, she obviously cannot work while she is hospitalized in Ruby Memorial. Travel expenses andfood for her husband Tom and son Trent are adding up very quickly. Tom has to travel back and forth to work and has been stayingwith Tina on the weekend.My goal is to help provide money so they can concentrate on healing during the rough chemo-therapy and recovery. 
The funds raised will be used for medical bills, food, travel and whatever elseTina, Tom and Trentneed during the fight. They need the money now, so I hope you can find, even a dollar, to help out. 
The fact that perfect strangers often give money to different causes is notlost on me. I have contributed to things that don't have the levity of what I am asking you to do. Just know that my family and I will be forever grateful for your donation and prayers for Tina.

We found out that my heart had 3 blocked arteries.1st- 100%2nd- 95%3rd- 75%Always listen to your body.I then underwent CABG surgery aka Triple Bypass surgery.Recovery was touch and go. I was on a ventilator almost 3 days fighting for my life.Now I'm on the long road to recovery. No health insurance. They've told me that I will be out of work for 1 to 3 months. Limited duty. I'll need ramps, medical supplies and devices. My diet will change.I'll need many follow ups and in home care. I'm about 1 hour away from my cardiac team.Lot's of therapy.Meds, meds and more meds.All of this with lost income doesn't mix and will make recovery tougher. With no medical coverage, we will rely on Medicaid but my bills will exceed over $500,000.I'm happy to be here on earth breathing.Thank each one of you.Read more"

Crashing onto cement, she sustained a serious brain injury and was in a coma, intubated for five days. She spoke her first words yesterday to our mom, “Love you”. She has difficulty with body movement, and is now in desperate need of acute neurological rehabilitation. Christina is currently in a hospital without the rehabilitation services she needs.

She proved this when she came out in total remission from her battle with breast cancer. She was diagnosed in late 2014, and was just getting back to normal life as a physical therapist, a compassionate caregiver of many on their paths to better health. Now she is back to fighting.

During her recovery after giving birth and not quite feeling right, she went in to see her doctor. During some follow-up imaging appointments, her doctors found a mass on her pancreas and lesions on her liver. Needless to say, Tiffany has been diagnosed with Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer, which has metastasized to her liver. Tiffany has a medical team together, and they have decided that aggressive chemotherapy is required two days on and twelve days off continuously.Tiffany and Dean have a tough road ahead. One way we can all help is by letting them deal with this tough journey without the financial stress this is bringing them in every component of their lives - not just the burden of the medical expense, especially as they seek further guidance outside the realm of their insurance.

This is Rob Lauer addressing all of Carey Whitley’s friends and loved ones. Carey recently suffered a severe stroke while alone in his home late in the evening of Tuesday, March 2nd. Unable to lift himself and get to his phone, he laid on the floor fully conscious until, thankfully, concerned neighbors and police entered the house and found him nearly 20 hours later, around 10:00 pm the next night. Carey was rushed to Riverside Hospital in Newport News, VA., where he is being treated for what was an extremely serious stroke. His mind is good; no mental impairments, but his speech is slurred, and he has minimal mobility on his left side. He will next be transferred to Riverside’s Rehabilitation hospital, where he will undergo extensive rehabilitation. Carey is in desperate need of funds to cover medical bills and expenses. Any donations will be greatly appreciated.I know that thousands of people throughout Hampton Roads have been touched and positively impacted by Carey’s 30-year career as a funeral director. Carey always described his work as a funeral director as “a ministry,” helping people through one of the most difficult things in life—the loss of a loved one. It should come as no surprise to anyone that working so closely with death and daily tending to those grieving could be very depressing work. But despite the personal emotional toll that this work has on funeral directors, Carey always believed that he was doing God’s work. If Carey has helped you with the death of a loved one, please consider making a donation.Anyone who knows Carey also knows what a brilliant pianist and singer he is. Throughout his life, when he wasn’t at the funeral home, he could be found in church, where he served for decades as a minister of music, organist/pianist, choir director, handbell choir director, and vocalist. In addition, hundreds of people across Hampton Roads have requested Carey to sing at weddings, funerals, baptisms, dinners, and other social events. Since he was a child in rural Georgia, playing the piano and singing have been essential parts of Carey’s soul! His prayer—and the prayer of all those who love him—is that through rehabilitation, Carey will return to playing the piano and singing. If Carey’s music has ever touched you, please consider making a donation.

In closing, here is a link to a music video that Carey made last summer when most of us were homebound because of COVID. Wanting to put his music out in the world for people to enjoy, he made several trips to the empty sanctuary of Trinity United Methodist Church in Newport News, VA, and was videotaped playing some of his favorite hymns and inspirational songs, which were then edited into one video. Please enjoy Carey's music and if you are able, please make a donation so that this gifted and caring man can recover and return to making music that touches people.

I have been extremely ill since the beginning of February. It is typically really hard for me to ask for help because I am such a strong and independent spirit, but now it's time for me to ask for help. It's hard to explain what is happening to me and my body because I have yet to find a medical explanation. In January, I was finally completing my healing journey, which took about 3 years to heal from various health issues. I had done it and I was so, so proud. Because of severe digestive issues and food intolerances, I had only been eating about eight hundred to maybe twelve hundred calories per day. It caused my period to fizzle out and my breasts to shrink. Now that I had healed my digestive system and food intolerances I was so excited to start eating the proper amount of calories and finally move into abundant, radiant health!! I didn't know that it was very bad to increase your calories significantly after being restricted for so long. I jumped up to 2000 a day overnight and sustained it for a few days. In those few days, I had an episode where my entire body went numb, I almost blacked out, my hearing and vision went out. I thought I was about to drop dead. This is when I found out about ""refeeding syndrome"". It's an electrolyte imbalance that happens to people who restrict their eating and then increase their food rapidly and it can be fatal. It's a very, very serious condition. I immediately went to the dr. She checked my levels and said I was fine and to keep doing what I was doing. I thought that was odd, and I KNEW in my soul, something was up with the increase in food, but instead of listening to myself, I relied on the dr's advice. I dropped my calories down to about fourteen to fifteen hundred per day and kept going. Soon after, I became more ill. Feeling like I was going to faint or blackout all day long. Then, very weirdly, over a week, my breasts shrunk half the size. I knew something not right was happening but I kept going, thinking that this would pass at some point and that my body was just readjusting. During this time, I had started the Sex Coach Headquarters Virtual Office and even some of the girls Andrea and Marianne were keeping an eye on me incase I were to pass out. Then, I started having increasingly scary things happening, like episodes of what seemed like hypoglycemia - tongue, lips, arms and legs going numb, the room spinning, slurring my speech. I decided to start working with a registered dietician. I wanted to move beyond this. She suggested I stop counting calories and start just eating 3 balanced meals per day. I stopped counting and just did what she told me to do and without knowing I had shot up from 1400 calories a day to 2200. I sustained that for 2 days and on the second day was when all hell broke loose. It was like something literally broke in my endocrine system. My body was literally SCREAMING for me to stop eating. My legs and face were on fire. I had rashes and the most intense panic attack of all time. I didn't know what was happening to me. My heart was beating so fast that I thought it was going to give out. It was like being on a runaway car. Most panic attacks last 10 min. This panic attack lasted 2 straight weeks. It was the most horrific, terrifying experience of my entire life. My body wouldn't accept food, but I was still trying to feed it. I could not stand, I could not get up. I was so extremely weak and shaky. After a few days, the panic was so bad I had to get up and take a walk or run about 7x per day. ALL I could do ALL DAY was try to manage the constant, never ending experience of panic. I was eating less than 700 calories per day. I went to stay with my partner's parents because his mom was a nurse and I needed constant monitoring and help. She started feeding me 6x per day, trying her best to even out what was happening to my body. Hell broke loose again and this is where the neurological stuff really kicked in. More episodes of ""hypoglycemia"" without any change in blood sugar. My blood pressure, which is normally in the 90's was 140. I felt like I constantly couldn't breathe, I was being choked, my heart rate was 120 at resting. My metabolism was so out of control, I lost 7lbs in a couple of days. At this point, I am getting really, really fucking scared. I go back to the dr and I BEG. I am HYSTERICAL. I am a month into what was happening to me and I was screaming at her that I was going to DIE. I was completely sure that I was going to drop fucking dead and no one was listening! Everyone kept telling me, ""you're having panic attacks."" NO SHIT. But what they couldn't get through their minds was that A. I am not prone to panic and B. The panic is an effect of what was happening to me metabolically/hormonally. The dr gave me xanax, which obviously did nothing. I had to take matters into my own hands and stop listening to everyone else. I normally eat 2x per day and I decided to stop eating almost completely to slow my metabolism down. The first day I ate 200 calories. The next day 300. It started settling. My heart rate, blood pressure, and panic episodes were calming down a tiny bit. I needed to listen to my body. Only eat when I was genuinely hungry. It was helping, but I couldn't get beyond 500 calories without having a full blown panic attack. I made the decision to leave Ireland, where I was living to be close to my partner and his family, and go back to the US to get medical care. Hard enough to be separated during a pandemic, but then leaving for medical reasons and not knowing when we will be reunited.An international flight alone while experiencing all of this is very hard. I made it through, got to my moms and went straight to the emergency room. They were unable to find anything ""life threatening"" wrong with me, but I was now down 9 lbs. Staying at my mom's the last 2 weeks, I was able to make some small improvements by listening to my body and allowing my appetite to come back naturally. Between that and constant meditation, my appetite started to regulate. Then, my partner bailed on me. A week after I was home, he called to break up with me. I am able to increase my food a little bit, but when I do, I start having neurological issues and panic attacks. They started up again yesterday after about 2 days with no neurological stuff. It's beyond terrifying to feel like you have no control over your nervous system and to feel like you could just pass out and die any moment of the day. Needless to say, between the most terrifying experience of my life, facing the genuine feeling of death and now heartbreak piled on - it's too much. The pain is beyond. The fear is beyond. I haven't worked in 6 weeks. I have no savings left and the dr bills are piling up. I am now down 13lbs. I have never been afraid for my life. It is a very, very scary feeling. Sometimes I think this is it - I am going to die. Other times I think, I can't experience this another day and I need to end it. Other times I think, I can do this. I can get beyond this and back to the light that is within me. It's going to be a long road to recovery and I am not sure how long I will be out of work. I am asking for help with personal and dr bills. It is a very hard ask for me, but I am just at such a low and scary point that I really need some support. The dr. visit today, without any bloodwork is $400 alone and I have no idea if he will be able to provide me with any understanding, plan or solutions. My life is in pieces and I am so ashamed.Anything you could offer me, from words of support, to dr recommendations, to even 5$ would be the most incredible help. Thank you friends.Read more"
