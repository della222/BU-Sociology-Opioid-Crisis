  Thank you for taking the time to visit our page. Desmon Silva needs our love and support. On July 16, Desmon stopped breathing. He is currently in the ICU on a ventilator, fighting to recover from a condition the doctors believe occurred as a result of his recent battles with both Covid19 and influenza that has left him (we pray temporarily) unable to move on his own. Desmon has always been a lover, but now also a fighter. He is 22 years young, and will likely celebrate his 23rd birthday inthehospital. Despite his condition, Desmon remains full of life.

  Desmon’s smile could light up the skyway. His giggle could make waves ripple through oceans worldwide. His zest for life could move mountains. He will fight the fight to come back, but he has a long road ahead. Desmon is a devoted and loving son,brother,grandson, nephew, cousin, friend, partner, and recent RN working in a hospital on the front lines - always willing to go the extra mile for his family and friends, and his patients. Let us come together to go the extra mile for him. Desmon needs to return to breathing and walking on his own, so that he is able to continue helping and healing people, living the big and the small moments of his young life, catching sunsets, seeking adventure, celebrating his accomplishments, and growing old with those he loves. Des – we all are rooting for you.  This GoFundMe will help ease the financial burden that Desmon will be left with, including costs associated with his current treatment, as well as the extensive rehab he faces in the road ahead. No amount is too small. He will be grateful for anything you can contribute- evenif it is prayers.PLEASE SHARE WITH ANYONE!

Most details we still don't know, but the incident left him intubated and in a coma for almost two weeks. After 12 excruciating long nights of uncertainty, Daniel woke up! Gradually he came of the ventilator and is re-learning how to eat, drink, and speak again. However there is obvious severe physical and mental damage for which he will need medical care for the unforeseeable future. Unfortunately he was living in Nevada by himself away from his family and friends in NJ. Medical air transport is the only way we can get him back to NJ, but the price is astronomically high. We need help from friends and family like you to bring Daniel back home.Daniel is 35 years old. He is a wonderful godfather and uncle. He would tirelessly play with his niece and nephew for hours. They love him dearly. Daniel's mother, Marilyn Guzio, has been out in Nevada watching over him in the hospital. She has been living out of a hotel while spending all her time focused on Daniel. He needs to come home to his family and friends so we can share the load of helping and supporting him in his recovery and extensive rehab.

Luna is 3.5 years old. We adopted her from a rescue when she was a couple of months old and we love her dearly. She is clever and funny and is a bonded companion to our other rescue dog Mikey. She loves life and is generally active and happy.She became lame at an agility lesson in July 2019 and X-rays showed that the groove for her patella (kneecap) on her rear right leg wasn’t deep enough and that the patella was moving. The vet said it was relatively minor and that she had been born with it. She had several physiotherapy/hydrotherapy sessions plus we changed her diet, exercise and added in supplements to help minimise the wear/tear.She had her front left leg amputated in June 2020 following a freak accident when out on a walk. 

I won’t lie, the last 9 months have been exhausting mentally, physically and financially as the surgery was exempt from insurance. We used our savings for the amputation and the rehab since. Adapting the home to fill the needs of a disabled dog goes past just meds and physio... we have gates on the stairs, extra steps in the garden, rugs taped to hard floors, special harness, vetbed bedding to prevent pressure sores, memory foam beds to ease pressure on her joints and 101 other ‘extras’ that we never knew we needed until her accident. She has daily massage and paw care. For the first 2 months after her amputation we slept in shifts so that someone was awake with her 24/7.

10 days ago she became lame again. We assumed it was tight muscle across her back/hips so took her to her physio for laser therapy/massage but the physio said it was her right knee again. There was heat, swelling, ‘clunky’ movement and reduced flexibility. Today she was sedated for X-rays and the vet found that the groove for the patella had reduced due to movement eroding the edges so her kneecap was now moving freely on the bone and not sitting where it was supposed to be. A second diagnosis was sought from an orthopaedic specialist who confirmed the only treatment option is surgery.Insurance doesn’t cover pre-existing conditions. The initial operation estimate is £1396.53. We don’t have that now, the amputation cleared out my savings.  The last 9 months of therapies/meds/adaptations/vets visits following her amputation continually use any spare money after bills so haven’t been able to replenish my savings. 





Luna is on enforced rest until we can find the money for the operation. Those of you that have followed her journey over the years know that for a dog that enjoys life as much as Luna this is hard.So I am asking for help. It’s not something that comes easily to me as I have been fiercely independent since a teenager and have always worked hard to support my family and any foster dogs that we have.Over the many years that I have done voluntary rescue work I have tirelessly helped out on transport runs/homechecks/training/walking/fostering/rehab/fundraising/website building and general support for others at my own expense and rarely asked for support but I need it now for Luna.The initial estimate is £1396.53. That’s just anestimate if everything goes to plan. If the amputation is anything to go by the actual cost on the day could be a couple of hundred pounds higher plus we will also have the added cost of vet checkups/physio etc. Covid has affected all of us financially and I accept that so anything that you can spare will be greatly appreciated. Please share if you can and help us get Luna up and about again.Thankyou so muchSally x

As some of you know we have Ruger, a beautiful English Mastiff who without a doubt is the sweetest dog I've ever had. He's only 5 1/2 years old and has a lot of life left in him. He recently incurred a partial ACL tear in his rear left leg. At the time it was believed that it could heal on its own with rest, exercise and meds. However, likely due to his weight (200lbs+), it tore completely and subsequently he incurred a partial tear in his rear right leg in the course of waiting until we could meet with an orthopedic specialist. They recommended surgery to repair the left leg and we may even be facing repair to the right leg but we're not 100% sure yet. Needless to say, I left their officedevastated because the anticipated cost of the surgery and rehab is honestly quite daunting and really more than we can afford.So, I was faced with having to place a value on Ruger's life and ultimately making that dreaded decision of taking that final journey to the Rainbow Bridge...all because of money which sickened me. In the course of preparing myself for losing him, my son Alex, who refuses to give up on him is convinced he still has life left in him and deservesachance to live. And at the end of the day, I had to agree we have to at least try. So we're rolling the dice and putting our money and faith in Ruger (and God) and the fact he's in good health otherwise. Those of you who have or have had pets know how deep your love is for them - you can't measure or quantify it. He has brought us so much joy, love and honestly, a lot of comfort for me through some difficult times. He's almost been more human than dog. I know that may sound strange but maybe it's his size, or the way he looks at me with his eyes and the way he talks to me. Yes, he actually talks and calls for me and it sounds like he's saying ""Mama""! Some of you have heard him so you know what I'm talking about. It's almost ridiculous but ridiculously sweet! He is already in the care of Quartet Veterinary Specialty & Emergency Hospital in Cary, NC. He has lost most of his mobility and even desire to eat or drink so they are taking care of him until surgery can be scheduled which I anticipate will be as early as tomorrow, Monday, August 13 so time is of the essence and the charges have already started coming in and subsequently sohave the panic attacks!I can't begin to tell you how much any amount is placed on your heart to give will mean to us. Much like I can't put a price on Ruger's life, I won't be able to express just how much this will mean to me, Alex and Ruger. Those of you who know me, know I don't like asking for help and as I mentioned, I never thought I'd find myself here. I much prefer to give but today I'm going against every fiber of my being and am asking for your mercy, generosity, kindness and your prayers.Andplease know, that if you can't or choose not to give, know that it is ok. I only ask that youkeep us in your prayers and share our story. Those prayersare invaluable to us as well.

Chris Hyland is one of my best mates whom I met when I joined the military back in 2009. He's one of the strongest blokes I've ever met both physically and mentally, finishing top of whatever he did. He has done multiple tours in Afghanistan as a sniper and I never thought anything bad could happen to this guy.

I was all set to go and meet up with him and his family on the 28th December, however on Christmas Day I got a phone call from his dad telling me it was all cancelled. On the 23rd December when everyone was getting ready for Christmas Eve, Chris was found lying facedown on the floor at home grabbing the back of his head screaming in pain. He was rushed to A&E where he had a head scan. It showed the worst thing you could've wished for; he'd had a severe bleed on the brain. It was an Arteriovenous Malformation which lead to him being taken to the national hospital for Neurology in Queen Square London where he had drains put into his skull and a number of operations. He was rushed up and down from the intensive care unit over a period of weeks; things were really not looking good for Chris. 

Now a few months on he is stable and awaiting a couple more operations to get his vision back and stabilise the artery in his head to reduce the chances of this happening again. He has completely lost his short term memory and struggles retaining information: he doesnt know who's been to see him from 1 hour to the next. Things are improving and he has been getting therapy trying to work on this but it's going to be a long slow process. However Coronavirus has set him back as he can no longer be in rehab and has had to move into his parents home in Liverpool, leaving his young family in London.

Chris is the sort of guy that would do anything to help anyone and never ask for anything in return. He has the biggest heart you could imagine and that's why I want to do what I can to tell his story and try to get some financial help for his family while he is unable to work. His partner Claire has done amazing with everything that she has been subject to over the past few months keeping their 2 children, Jake and Grace, as happy as they can be. I know it's taking its tole on them physically, mentally and financially, that's why I just want to ask if anyone can donate whatever they can afford and to share this post as far as you can. This family have never asked for anything off anyone in their lives, and have always done whatever they can to help everyone else, so please please please give what you can to help them. 

If you know Chris then please comment about him and try to reach out to as many people as you can. If you don't know him then please just add some well wishes for him as I know he will read and appreciate every one. 

Thanks for reading

Unfortunately, the same day he was diagnosed, my father got admitted into the hospital for emergency open heart surgery. Since then, my father has undergone 3 more major surgeries and rehab. Last month, my mother in law also unexpectedly passed away. Dealing with all these unfortunate setbacks has only been harder because we are expecting our first child any day now. Due to these circumstances, Gordo’s health was put on a back burner. Today (2/5/2021) we took him to the vet after noticing some alarming symptoms and were given two choices: emergency surgery to remove the blockages (his kidneys are failing due to the bladder stones now) or euthanize him. We went for the emergency surgery option so our son could grow up with his big brother.

In April, both of my parents contracted Covid-19 at the same time. My mom, Sue, recovered after a brutal couple of weeks, but my dad Greg was not as lucky. He’s had asthma all his life, so the virus hit him hard. He was intubated in early April and spent 6 long weeks on a ventilator alone, fighting for his life. He fought so hard to get back to his family and his dog for six weeks, where he endured too many complications to list. We received news many times that things were not looking good, to prepare for the worst. It was a terrifying and heartbreaking time for our family. In late May, his lungs finally had healed enough and the infection had subsided and he was able to be taken off the ventilator to start trying to breathe on his own. I will never forget the phone call from my mom - I was at a greenhouse distracting myself with flowers - “he’s off the vent?? OFF off??” Tears. From there, he spent weeks in the ICU and then many more weeks in acute rehab, re-learning how to do almost everything - walk, eat, dress himself- being on life support for six weeks had completely deconditioned him as the virus ravaged his poor body. He was determined and worked so hard in rehab to get back home to his family and his beloved dog, Bode. We are beyond proud of him. We recently welcomed him home, which was just an amazing blessing that I still have a hard time wrapping my head around. He’s home. We’re indescribably grateful. With his homecoming comes home care and therapies and prescriptions, medical bills and financial pressure and stress for my mom. She’s now the sole provider with the typical household expenses to take care of and could really use some help. My parents are pretty private and would never in a million years ask for help, so I am asking for them. I’m also not great at asking for help (just ask my husband) but I am willing to do just about anything to ensure they can reconnect and heal together with as little financial stress as possible. My dad is truly a miracle and we are so fortunate. Thank you for reading our story!

What some may not know, Billy is one of the best Country line dance instructors out there. Most of his line dancers know him as “DUDE” as he teaches dancing almost 6 days a week. Billy is known to also donate his time as a member and volunteer to a few different charities, such as the Knights of Columbus, the Elks, and the Jaycees. He also participates in the collection of aluminum cans for the blind with the Lyons club and just always being there for anyone, anytime. We had even come to find out, but are not surprised to hear, Bill spent a weekend down at a New York church during 9/11 donating his time to helping others. That’s Bill!! With a warm smile across his face, no matter what!With all that being said, now Bill needs our help. Last Saturday Bill took a fall and was rushed to the emergency room in severe pain. You hope for the best, but unfortunately, he has received a diagnosis that no one saw coming. Bill has been diagnosed with Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma, or Kidney Cancer. The mass they found is 10 cm and inoperable. It has spread to his Pelvic bone which has caused Bill to become somewhat immobile, and for the most part in extreme pain when he tries to walk. Thankfully, Bill has returned home, one week from his admittance to the hospital. Bill will have a very long road ahead. Between Immunotherapy treatments and rehab to learn to walk to the best of his ability again, the physical and mental stress will be a challenge, but the burden of his medical expenses will be extreme. To add to Bill’s story, his loving wife Diane of almost 29 years is dealing with MS on a daily bases, which has resulted in her becoming permanently disabled. Diane and Bill solely depend on Bill’s income to support their family and for obvious reasons, Bill will not be able to return to work any time soon. Our wish and hopes are to see our brother Bill in those cowboy boots and up on that dance floor, calling out the moves just like he has for many years along with that big-hearted smile he gives to everyone!!We ask you to consider supporting Bill and Diane during this very difficult time in their lives. These funds will help to defer medical expenses and the physical therapy he will need to make use of his leg again. Most of all we ask that you keep Bill and Diane in your prayers and we thank you for your consideration!Sincerely,Family, Friends and Cowboys & Sweethearts!Read more"

We recognize our tremendous power and reach as dynamic cultural resources in the Philadelphia region, receiving visitors and tourists from all over the world to our spaces to engage with our exhibitions, events, and programming. At the same time, we treasure our deep relationships with our close neighbors, serving as spaces for collective care, community forums, and political education. Our intentions have always been to offer ourselves as resource and sanctuary.TCGM and PRHM are small (and small is good.)community-oriented institutions situated in working-class residential neighborhoods serving largely Black communities which we know to be disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. The dramatic loss of life, rates of illness, historic unemployment, and health vulnerabilities experienced by essential workers in our neighborhoods ask that we be mindful of ensuring everyone has access to life necessities during this time, including that a stimulus for Black Philadelphiansis critical for our communities to recover and survive.The Colored Girls Museum is located in West Germantown and the Paul Robeson House & Museum is located in the Walnut Hill neighborhood of West Philadelphia. We make due on the very marginal overhead that we hold in our arts-based non-profits, cherishing our committed volunteers, primarily Black cultural workers, to whom we are always sincerely grateful for their offerings that allow us to fulfill our dedicated and spiritual mission to affirm Black memory and Black life. We have a high burden to meet in reopening our institutions---the cost associated with making the improvements to our spaces which will ensure the safety of already vulnerable communities is vital.Yet, we admittedly navigate a shared struggle existing within an inequitable philanthropic landscape where research has persistently foundthat “transformative community organizations led by women and girls of color have zero funding and are entirely dependent on volunteers.” This should not be the case, but it is. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the expected cuts we see coming (even as we FIGHT BACK!) in the Philadelphia cultural sector, we find it incredibly important that we invite our communities to join with us at this moment in this urgent call for support. To no surprise, we expect that the philanthropic climate for sustainable arts funding moving forward will do what it historically has done and ignore us. However, as beloved WPCA founder Fran Aulston let it be said “We never let having no money stop us!”This capital campaign, at minimum, focuses on making our institutions ready for a gradual, safe, and sustainable return in alignment with established physical distancing protocols. We created this fund to ensure that we create access to personal protective equipment, sanitizing materials, air purifiers, contactless fixtures, and to recover lost revenue in anticipation of reducing the number of visitors in our spaces. When our Black arts institutions are stable, we exist as critical infrastructure for our communities to withstand traumatizing, turbulent times and organize the fight so that the source(s) of these traumas may be eviscerated. Our organizations are models of grassroots innovation, responsiveness, and flexibility providing exactly the kind of resources that are necessary to push through difficult seasons such as now.Our Black mamas told us that when we ask for something, it's more than a notion to name what we truly desire and to that end, we provide these descriptions of what this fund, if/when it achieves its full proposed goal, will support:**We are also open to opportunities where these resources can be provided through in-kind services and other potential approaches. Please email us if you have offerings or insights around these goals.**Shared Costs between the Paul Robeson House & The Colored Girls MuseumAir Purifiers: $6,700Sanitizer Stations: $3,000Protective Equipment & Cleaning Supplies: $4,000Goals for The Colored Girls MuseumCleaning staff: $20,000—Contracting with a professional, high quality cleaning service to provide hygienic cleaning throughout TCGM in response to visitor tours for 2020-21.Stretch: The Colored Girls MuseumPorch renovations: $17,000—The porch has always been such a significant space in black culture --TCGM will upgrade the front porch of The Colored Girls Museum replacing porch floor boards, banisters, and railings to extend the exhibiting space of the museum for visitors.

My dad was diagnosed with a cancerous mass in his liver in November. Since then he has been in and out of the hospital and too weak to go to work. He has been receiving chemo treatments for the past month with an estimate of another 16 weeks remaining. As of last week dad was in the hospital and has recently been transferred to a local rehab facility until he can gain his strength back. There is no estimate of how long he will be in there at this time.

Mom has been working her full time job and comes home to take care of dad when he is there, on top of driving back and forth to treatments. Unfortunately all of the medical expenses are beginning to come in on top-of their current bills.

In efforts to assist with some of the financial burden during this difficult time we are trying to raise enough money to cover the cost of the additional cost my family is taking on to ensure my mom doesn’t have to worry and can focuson taking care of my dad to help him beat this. Thank you to all of our family and friends for all of your prayers and support. We appreciate you all.

Hi, my name is Brian. I am writing today asking for help for my wife, Heather. We met in 1994 and have been married for 20 years. We have two children, an 18 year old daughter who is starting college this spring and a 16 year old son, who is finishing his junior year of high school.Heather has always wanted to help children that struggled in school. She has been a teacher for as long as I've known her and wants nothing more than to help them succeed. She has taught in Ohio and North Carolina in grades 2-8. Heather has served in coaching roles too, to help other teachers succeed in the classroom. When Heather wanted to see if her coaching techniques were working, she went back into the classroom to see for herself. Most recently she has been working as a coach to a team of 3rd grade teachers in Greensboro.On Oct 10, 2020, Heather underwent a craniotomy to remove as much as they could of a lemon-sized brain tumor. She remained in ICU for two weeks and then a short hospital stay before going to rehab. During this time, we are still waiting for an official diagnosis. The photo I posted was taken the day before she went to rehab. We had just shaved her head. We both thought it looked great!After 4 days in rehab, Heather had a seizure that brought her back to the hospital on Oct 28th. On the 29th we received the official diagnosis of a class IV glioblastoma multiforme, which is a rare and aggressive brain tumor.Her team of doctors started her on chemo and 6 weeks of radiation. Heather has been in the hospital for over 50 days and completed 23 of the 30 radiation treatments. The radiation has completely wiped her out, making the stay in the hospital necessary to receive treatments. Heather was scheduled to receive her last radiation treatment on Dec 17th, but on Dec 8th, the team of doctors ordered an MRI to check progress. To everyones surprise and shock, the tumor was not responding to either the radiation or the chemo. It actually almost doubled in size. This was not expected. The doctors discontinued the treatment and increased the steroid to help the swelling come down. This was intended to help Heather regain some alertness and speech.Coivd has allowed us to visit one at a time. The three of us take turns spending as much time as we can with Heather. But it makes for a lonely journey because Heather struggles with her speech and we can’t visit as a family.We are asking for help with medical expenses relating to Heathers treatment. This includes the ER, imaging, transportation, medication, hospital stays, cancer research and any other related expenses.

The car crushed his body into a wall, and it is due only to what doctors are calling a “medical miracle” that he has so far survived.Yonkers EMS (Empress) was able to limit the bleeding on site, but he arrived at the Emergency Room in desperately critical condition. In the most chilling, heartbreaking moment of our ordeal, doctors told our mother that “he may not make it through the night."" Eight hours of surgery improved his condition to “sporadically stable.” We are eternally grateful to the trauma and orthopedic surgeons on call that night.Eddie had sustained a shattered pelvis, copious internal bleeding, large external wounds, spinal fractures, dislocated ribs, urethral and intestinal trauma, and irreversible nerve damage to his right leg. Several serious infection risks remain, including persistently unhealed wounds. A seemingly endless slate of surgeries, including blood transfusions and large skin grafts, have managed to correct some of these problems and keep him alive. However, more challenges await, and for those we are asking for your help. Eddie still requires multiple complex surgeries with out-of-network specialists. Even if all goes well, he will also need extensive physical therapy beyond his current regimen in acute rehab. Insurance will cover some of these and previous medical costs, but not all of them.
Perhaps not all potential donors know my brother personally. An alumnus of Yale, Northwestern Law, and Fordham Prep, Eddie aspires to help others through public service. During law school, he chose to forego corporate jobs in favor of internships in a NY District Attorney’s Office and an Illinois Court. He has aimed to use his drive and talent for the betterment of the community for as long as I can remember. For example, he organized a massive food drive during his teen years on the road to becoming an Eagle Scout. Eddie’s family and friends have always adored him for his honesty, wit, and unfailingly optimistic outlook. Incredibly, he has managed to keep his iconic smile throughout his three months in the hospital, including two months in the ICU. With his amazing strength of spirit, he is more often consoling and reassuring me and my parents than vice-versa. Eddie is and will forever be my hero.Eddie has been fortunate enough to benefit from an excellent support system. Our parents live for their children; his unflinchingly resilient girlfriend Kristen is essentially working a second job as Eddie’s nurse; there has been an outpour of love from his friends and from friends of the family. That said, my parents are distraught enough without potentially crippling financial burdens hanging over their heads. If you can help in any way, whether by donating or just by sharing this, we would be so very grateful.Thank you for your time and support,The Shaer family

Yatsen (my brother in law) and Anushka (my sister in law) are good people. Really good people. Kind people. Loving people. Hardworking people. Generous people. They value family, and love, and equality, and treating others with respect and dignity.This is them, when they found out that Yatsen's tumour is operable.

Here he is with my daughter - they're practically twins...I love those faces!Anushka is pregnant now too, and we're anxiously anticipating the arrival of a new little miracle in the fall.
They live a humble life, doing their best to get by in this world, as we all do.Little did they know, did we all know, that in one day their lives would be turned upside down. That's how this tends to go, right?
Yatsen had some drooping in his face on and off for a few weeks. They chocked it up to stress...Then, about 10 days ago, he had a few seizures...an ambulance ride to emergency, tests and an MRI later, and the brain tumour was discovered. Yatsen worked two jobs to support his family. Anushka worked three. In the best of times, it was a struggle to juggle the work with a toddler.
In one fell swoop, Yatsen was told that he cannot drive, and cannot work anymore. Effective immediately.
The tumour has to come out.We're talking brain surgery, chemo, radiation, and then rehab. This will take him out for a year.
And Anushka can't work now either, She has to assume the role of full-time caregiver to Xavi, and now Yatsen too.It's bad enough that they were dealt this horrible blow, but now they are going to need help getting by with a serious reduction in income. Suddenly, it'll be a year before they can work again.We're rallying.We're all trying to help them. We're doing our best. We need more help. Your generosity will help with groceries, cleaning, meal prep, diapers, alternative treatment options, cooking, gas, mortgage payments, maybe even daycare, and all the ""living"" that we all do every day....so that their ""living"" can focus on healing.  The smallest little bit will help. There is strength in numbers. Even if you cannot contribute monetarily, please send out good vibes into the universe for love and healing. His family needs themand needs him.It would mean so much to our family, to Yatsen and Anushka, and unbeknownst to them, even to Xavi and the new baby.Here we are, right after Xavi was born....Anushka, Yatsen and Xavi are in the middle. I remember that beautiful day when we did that photo shoot...We'll update you on the family's journey and Yatsen's progress. Through all of this, he remains positive, hopeful, and ready for the challenges ahead.Like a little kid, I close my eyes really really tightly, squeeze my hands together into fists, and make the biggest birthday wishes, and wishing upon star wishes....this will just be a road bump on a long and winding road.Love to all and thanks for your support,Keren

I have known them for almost 23 years and feel lucky to have them as neighbors. Due to the friendship we have developed over the years I am reaching out because I don’t know what else I can do to help them through their current situation.On September 13, 2020, while Louis and Renaé were vacationing in Myrtle Beach, SC, Louis was enjoying some time in the ocean when he was knocked down by a wave, hit his head on the sand and then another wave rolled him and slammed him on his back. Immediately after the incident Louis was still able to talk and move his hands but he was rushed to the hospital where this traumatic experience left him in an induced coma with severe spine and neck injuries as well as a broken hip. After 4 surgeries he is now back home in PA, out of the induced coma and at Kindred, an acute care facility in Havertown. It is not yet known how much he will recover but he has not been aware or coherent since immediately after the accident, he is not able to breathe without the aid of a ventilator and he is paralyzed from the chest down. While Louis is covered by Medicare, the medivac flight home was not, leaving Renaé to pay $14,000 out-of-pocket. Any additional money raised would go towards building a wheelchair ramp into their house, creating a bedroom for Louis on the first floor, purchasing a wheelchair accessible vehicle and future medical expenses not covered by Medicare. Louis is facing, at minimum, a month in acute care and then 1-2 years in a rehab center.Below is what their daughter, Rhea, sent out to friends and family 2 days after the accident:   There is much to be healed in the world and in ourselves during these times. I      know, but I ask you to consider my father, Louis John Cutillo. He is the most       humble, most gracious, most optimistic and most forgiving person I know.         They say little girls always think of their dads as heroes but then grow out of it.    I never have. He is the strongest, kindest, and smartest man that has been my     rock for 33 years. I would not be so bold without him, I would not have the        immense capacity to trust without him. I would not be the person I am today      without him. We have a small family. He means the world to my mother and I.   We need you.These last six months during COVID-19 have been trying on everybody, not just from a financial standpoint but mentally and emotionally as well. I cannot imagine what Rhea and Renaé are going through and I am helping them in any way that I am able.

Tabby Tails is a 501c3 government recognized specialty in home cat rescue. I focus my work mostly on cats who are considered high risk. High risk cats are ones who have a high chance of being euthinzed in kill shelters.I work a lot with disbaled cats. I care for several blind, paraplegic, deaf, and CH cats, along with cats who have incontinence issues and have to wear diapers.My rescue has always been fairly small. I care for around a dozen disbaled cats. But I also take on cats from bad situations, who are critically injured/ill and feral kittens. So currently the rescue houses 75 cats.Thats more than I had EVER thought I'd be caring for. But recently my rescue has exploded with love and support after a few viral videos. Those donations have allowed me to upgrade our set up and always have a stable medical fund. With that, I've been able to financially save more cats.Very quickly though we are out growing our current set up and our growth doesn't seem to be slowing down. I don't want it to either. I want to ride this wave that helps me save as many cats as possible.But not only is the current set up not big enough for the number of cats, but ot also lacks proper places for supplies and we have no trash outlet besides the weekly one can pick up. We're starting to burst at the seams, but like I said, i don't want to slow down.So I half heartily started looking for buildings that would continue to work as an in home rescue. And boy did I find some.Because of the nature of my rescue, I want it to continue being an in home rescue. For some lf the disabled cats, its important that I'm near by and can give them the midnight diaper changes, midnight seizure support and so on. Some of these cats have viable lives only because I'm always a couple feet away. They deserve that continued care. So I want that to be clear in this campaign, that I will be living in whatever building purchased for the cats. BUT that means we still won't have major operational costs. As I will still cover all utilities, taxes and so forth. I am also an unpaid worker and that will also continue. I never wanted to take any money from the cats and that will continue. I will continue working my second job to have the money to provide for the housing.I found a nearby apartment complex that I believe could fit the rescues needs perfectly. It is 7 units and only 10k, BUT with this purchase I have tl have funds to renovate it right away, or the purchase won't be approved. That is why the funding is set so high. The listing says it will need complete rehab. But it could make the best cat rescue. I could have one unit and then convert the rest for the rescue. With a set up like this major changes would come to the rescue.Like being able to have volunteers. As it stands I have never been ok with asking volunteers to come in and help with the rescue, because it is my house. So I, while working a 30 hour a week job, solely care for the cats. This has left me with over 70 hour work weeks and it's getting very difficult to keep up. Having stable volunteers could help me immensely.I would also be able to have the rescue open to the public. As it stands we are appointment only because again it's my home. But this way the doors can be open for adoptions, and donations. That should dramatically increase our adoptions and allow us to save more cats!I will also have a crap ton more space for things like fundraisers and adoption events!We would have space for a dumpster and parking.With this amount of space we could easily triple the amount of cats we can save. We can keep happy disbaled cats from being euthinzed. We can pull from more high kill shelters like we did for feather and her kittens. And we can take one more emergencies! We could even use one whole unit just for a MEDICAL WING! The chances of illness spreading would be reduced to almost zero!Saving cats is my life's passion. I believe I was placed on this earth for this purpose. This is something I need to do, and with your help, I want to make the best cat rescue in Ohio! Help me save more. They deserve so much more. stormy here has neurological issues and brain damage. She gets confused on where she is and tends to bite very hard. She came to us after her previous foster was told she would be euthinzed for these issues. She is happy and healthy living at the rescue. I understood her issues and gave her a chance. She can be difficult sometimes, but she is also full of life and love.Drizzle was born with nerve damage to her back end. She cannot move her tail, walks flat footed and cannot control her bowels. She has to wear a diaper. But she loves to play and cuddle. She only answers you the name baby!The black and white kitten in the front is Bracken. He doesn't know this but I drove 12 hours round trip to save him, his brother, a mom with her kitten, and another mom with 5 newborns. They a came from a high kill shelter. They would have been euthinzed if not pulled by us.Peaches is our paraplegic kitten. She cannot use her hind end. Her bladder must be expressed 3 times a day and she has to wear a diaper.I was able to save all of these cats because of the support I've gotten recently. If that support is continued and our space expended, imagine what I could do. I'm willing to put in all the work I need too, I just need some help.Read more"

Hello friends,
I am reaching out to you because I am starting a GofundMe page for my son, Billy, and his family.

On February 17th,my daughter-in-law, Mary Mash, fell very ill. She contracted the Flu types A and B which turned into pneumonia, filling her left lung completely. This caused her to go into complete respiratory failure which the local hospital couldn’t handle so they medivacked her to Emory University Hospital. When she got there, she was put on ECMO (which is a lung bypass machine) to keep her blood oxygenated in order to give her lungs time to heal. After she comes off of ECMO, she will begin rehab to get her strength back in her muscles; this will take months.

 My son, Billy Mash, is doing everything that he can to care for her in Atlanta which is 4 hours away from his home. He has two little girls that also require his attention and is driving back and forth every week to care for Mary and their girls. I am setting up this page to try to help Billy and the girls during this stressful time. My goal is to raise$5,000.00for them. I know that money can be tight, so please know that even$5.00will help.


Thank you for all the prayers and support you have given the family; it means the world to him and thank you in advance for sharing this page and your continued support. Let me know if you have any questions; I will be happy to answer them.Read more"

My nephew Isaiah has been through a lot in his 13 years - over 70 broken bones and 12 surgeries – in his fight against Osteogenesis Imperfecta (“Brittle Bones Disease”). OI is a rare genetic mutation that affects his body’s collagen, resulting in fragile bones, but also affecting his joints and ligaments and even his organs. Despite being in pain every day, “Zay” is a fighter, and has a great attitude. Doctors said he’d never walk, but he did – and he even ran! His courage in the face of lots of adversity inspires me. The Fight of His Life With Lots at StakeNow, he’s in the biggest fight of his life. His condition has led to a form of scoliosis that is rapidly progressing. In the last 4 months his spinal curve has progressed from 30° to 60°+. Much more and it can affect his breathing and heart. He’s had to withdraw from school due to the pain. Typically this would call for a spine fusion surgery, which carries with it a high % of complications, many of which are negatively life-changing. In Isaiah’s case, if he has spine fusion surgery now, he will almost certainly have to have another one after he finishes growing. All of this means that he will lose mobility and his pain will increase, and during his life the scoliosis may continue to progress and necessitate even more surgeries still. Ultimately, if he goes down that road, Isaiah may become wheelchair bound instead of being the active kid he is. And he was also just diagnosed with dilation of the arterial root – a potentially life-threatening heart condition - so a 6 to 8 hour surgery is just not what he needs right now if he can avoid it. There is a lot at stake.There’s Hope: A Non-surgical Treatment that Works!But my brother Lon and his wife Amanda have found a treatment for their son, and I want to help Isaiah get it. They’ve discovered a leading-edge treatment called the Schroth method and a high-tech brace called a SpineCor that have achieved tremendous results at treating the underlying causes of scoliosis (rather than just surgically patching up its affects), and even reversing the curve, even in kids with OI. It’s cutting edge, but it’s also the most studied and proven successful non-surgical method in the medical field and has been in use for decades in Europe, despite the fact that some in the orthopedic field seem oblivious to it in the US. And it works. The closest provider is Scoliosis Systems in Dallas, and Isaiah will travel there next week where Isaiah will undergo intensive training in how to self-align his own spine on a daily, even minute-by-minute basis, as well as perform certain exercises each day, all the while wearing a high-tech SpineCor brace 22 hrs a day that is engineered to rotate his spine back to its ccorrect position (or as closely as possible). Win-Win SituationEven if this treatment just slows down his scoliosis until he’s finished puberty, a spine fusion will be much more successful at that time. And this method and the brace (which can be worn comfortably and discreetly under his clothes) will help Isaiah throughout his lifetime maintain his spinal position and thus reduce the risk of re-surgery, increased back pain, and loss of mobility. That would be a huge win for Isaiah’s life, and I believe he’s the kind of person that is worth investing in. Cures are CostlyBut as with many medical advances, the financial costs are high, and my brother’s insurance will not cover it. Their years as missionaries didn’t make them rich, either. It is going to cost $4000 for the brace and $2,000 for the intensive 3-day training, plus doctor’s visits, x-rays and a litany of other tests that come to another $2500 (details below). There’s also the costs of travel and lodging and they have to purchase special exercise equipment for their home. This is all going to cost them around $9,000+ initially, and with quarterly follow-ups their out-of-pocket expenses will likely exceed $12,000, for the year. They’re willing to sell all they have to get Isaiah this critical brace and treatment. Urgent Appointment Next WeekWould you help them help their son? Due to the rapid progression of Isaiah’s scoliosis, they have booked the earliest appointment possible, March 31-April 2, which is just a week away, so yes, they could use it immediately. If you miss this week, they could still use the help at any time, as their expenses will continue to add up over the year. Thanks for your awesome generosity. Lon and Amanda and me will be forever grateful to you for standing withIsaiah in his battle against this awful disorder. Stay posted, because I will post updates as Isaiah battles scoliosis with his awesome new tools and techniques and continues to show us all what real courage looks like! Go Zay!

Thank you for joining in MiKaylas fight against brain cancer!We so appreciate YOU and your SUPPORT!If you’ve been following MiKayla’s story, you will know that this has been a constantly changing, evolving, and difficult journey. No beautiful, compassionate, kind hearted 26-year-old mother should ever have to take on a fight for her life; particularly amidst a global pandemic. Out of nowhere our lives were overturned when seemingly insignificantheadaches resulted in a trip to the ER, exposing multiple cancerous brain tumors in March of 2020.MiKayla started off being diagnosed with Oligodendroglioma a low grade cancer with a prognosis of 12 years to Aniplastic Astrocytoma a higher grade cancer with a prognosis of 5 years to Glioblastoma a high grade very aggressive cancer with a prognosis of 2 years. Within two weeks of that diagnosis her prognosis was changed again to only a few weeks... Most recently changed back to two years after a tumor resection and several treatments in San Francisco.Since the beginning we have sought to be as transparent as possible and provide you timely updates. Keeping our army of supporters closely in the loop.If you haven't been with us since the beginning, we strongly encourage you to look back on previous updates.

Kylie did a terrific job of helping our fundraising initiative; crushing our huge initial goal of $100,000! With the frequency of changes and desire to be as transparent as possible, we have changed organizers to MiKayla's husband. Austin has provided all updates and will continue to keep people informed and aware of their family's situation. Please note that the Original Story below is from March and many updates and changes have occurred. Original StoryMiKayla is an incredible 26-year-old woman. She is selfless, encouraging, hospitable, and servant hearted. She is a wife and a mom to two young boys (3 years old and 6 months old), and her family is her whole world. She passionately serves and loves her family, as well as she is a faithful and loyal friend. MiKayla radiates joy.On March 22, 2020 MiKayla was admitted to the hospital, after a month of experiencing debilitating migraines, nausea, and numbness in her limbs. She immediately underwent a CT scan and MRI which revealed two tumours the size of golf ballsin her brain. One of the tumours is on the front left side of her brain and the other is in the middle centre of her brain. A biopsy was done and the pathology report revealed that MiKayla has gradeII Oligodendroglioma. (UPDATE- MiKayla has Glioblastoma. Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive types of cancer that begins within the brain.)

MiKayla leads a very healthy lifestyle. She loves to be outside and can often be found playing with her sons in the backyard. She is a great cook and eats very well. She is also well-connected with her local church and has been active in serving and leading in her church. She has a deep and personal relationship with the Lord and seeks to do His will in her life. MiKayla is truly full of life! This diagnosis is very unexpected, and she has a long road ahead. Treatment planshave not yet been finalized, but at this time the doctors are planning to use radiation and/orchemotherapyto reduce the size of the tumours. MiKayla will likely undergo brain surgery to have the front tumour removed, as it is a “fairly easy” surgery. The tumour that is in the centre of her brain is much more difficult to get to. The doctors will decide at a later date if surgically removing it is viable. Due to the rarity and progression of MiKayla’s cancer, her family is looking into any and all treatment options, including ones not covered by insurance. We will do whatever it takes to beat her cancer.We do not know all the details, especially on costs. However, brain cancer in particular appears to be exceptionally expensive to treat because of the multitude of medical interventions needed as part of patients’ care. In fact, according to multiple studies, patients with malignantbrain tumors accrued health care costs that were 20-times greater than demographically matchedcontrol subjects without cancer.The costs cannot all be clearly articulated now, but we do know that they have an insurance deductible to meet, travel (driving, lodging) expenses, multiple treatments in and out of network, loss of at least one income and probably ancillary expenses like childcare, diet and medications etc. As more information becomes available, we will provide updates and possible financial adjustments to this fundraiser.MiKayla and her family are in need of your help during the most trying and difficult time of their lives. MiKayla is a fighter and although her world has just been turned upside down, she has been so brave throughout it all and she is ready to fight and beat this cancer. Please help MiKayla and her family as they battle this terrible disease. All funds raised will go directly to the Neufeld family. Any amount, large or small, will help and is greatly appreciated.We thank you for your donations, prayers, and support.If you are unable to donate, please help us by sharing this page with others.

The beavers both overcame severe pneumonia and had to fight for their lives to be survive and be where they are today.Almost a year later, BB and JJ, are thriving at the wildlife center! But as beavers grow, they need larger and larger enclosures and swim areas so they can learn their natural behaviors. The girls are currently in a 200 sq ft enclosure with a small pool for them to stretch those swimming legs, but this is far from what they need! We plan to enclose an area of 1.3 acres with a huge pond for them to have for their next 2 years of rehab before being released into the wild.We really want to give the girls a great space to grow and learn to be ""wild"" beavers, which is crucial to their future survival. The beavers REALLY need to get outside and we have a beautiful pond on property just 500 feet from the center that is just itching to be a beaver rehab habitat. Please help us to raise the funds to enclose our 3/4 acre pond and make a giant acre enclosure for the beavers to learn their natural behavior before being released back into the wild in late Summer 2022. These funds are for the 850 feet of 8ft fencing necessary to enclose the pond and be secure for the safety of the beavers. Being a non-profit organization, we are funded SOLELY from donations to take care of our rescued wildlife; we don't receive any state or federal funding. We survive day to day on the generosity of fellow animal lovers. The faster the beavers can get their enclosure outside, the more space will be freed up inside for us to save more and more orphaned wild animals in need of help.

When we were notified that there were 3 young Cane Corso’s abandoned on a mountain, we couldn’t NOT HELP. We did not hesitate. Not knowing what to expect as far as health and behavior issues, we stepped right up.We now know that these three dogs are going to need a lot of rehab and we are asking you, our village for help.Better together, we have combined forces along with Deity Animal Rescue and Paws For Life K9 Rescue to help these dogs heal and go on to live a beautiful life.PLEASE HELP by making a donation today.Every dollar counts. We need your help.Read more about this incredible rescue, we hope you can see in them what we did, and not turn away.Abandoned twenty miles into the Montrose forest on a very steep and remote mountainside, these three puppies have been doing their best to survive hunger, thirst and harsh weather conditions.

They were first spotted in late March by hikers. Dog Days Search and Rescue along with Montrose Search and Rescue were then notified and sprung into action to help save the trio. Various other individuals and rescue groups had also been traveling deep into the forest to feed and water the dangerously emaciated and dehydrated dogs, who could not survive the harsh conditions in the forest alone & had to be trapped.



Soon traps were set, finally all three dogs were brought to safety. On April 27th, after an entire month of planning and preparation, Gracie, George and Steve were rescued off of the mountain. And that’s when our work began.

We teamed up with Deity Animal Rescue and Paws For Life K9 Rescue & together we vowed to do whatever it takes to set them up to be happy and successful in life. Their future is now in our hands and we will not fail them.Gracie, George and Stevie are spending a few weeks with the amazing trainer Cheri Wulff Lucas. They are being allowed to decompress, and to be shown that they no longer need to exist in fear of surviving. They will be taught that they can trust humans and how to feel safe and confident. They are receiving 24 hour care and are already showing great signs of progress.



It took a village to save these dogs and bring them off of the mountain. It will now take a village to get them to a place where they can be totally rehabilitated from the trauma of being abandoned with no way to survive on their own.

To make certain they can finally get a chance at the life they deserve, we have created this GoFundMe so that together, as a collective, we can do what is right for these dogs.Humans have failed them miserably, but now we have been given the chance to change their destinies and give them hope for a safe life, a home and family. We are asking our animal loving community for their support to make this dream come true. Gracie, George and Stevie are still so young, with many years ahead of them. Let’s take what was wrong and make it right. Let’s do this. Together we can.Anything helps. And we are so grateful.

He was found unconscious and was taken to The University of Arizona Medical Center, where he remained unconscious until the next morning. As he regained consciousness, hospital staff monitored for progress and became concerned when motor movement of the arms and legs did not return. An MRI done on Tuesday night found a massive stroke in the pons portion of the brainstem. There was also damage in the back portion of the cerebellum. The stroke was caused by an infarct in the basilar artery. Surgery to remove the blood clot was discussed; however, it was considered too risky due to the amount of time that had passed since the onset of the stroke. Hemorrhaging in the brain was very likely if surgery was attempted and sudden blood flow was restored to the damaged portion of the brain. The damage in the pons portion of the brainstem has resulted in symptoms that are collectively called “Locked In Syndrome.” This is a very rare syndrome that affects 1% of stroke victims. Due to the low incidence of this type of stroke, there is limited research; however, classic symptoms of this type of stroke include paralysis of the arms and legs, as well as the inability to speak. Cognition or thinking ability stays intact, as does vertical eye movement. This means that my husband is aware of everything going on around him, but is unable to speak, eat, breathe on his own, or move. He can answer yes/no questions by moving his eyes up and down. The prognosis is not positive, with the biggest hope at this point being that my husband will hopefully regain lateral eye movement. Lateral eye movement will open a door to better communication options. There are computerized systems available that use cameras on the eyes to track eye movement in order for the person to make selections from a communication board. My husband has been in the intensive care unit for two weeks now. During these two weeks, he has struggled with pneumonia, staph infection, and strep infection in the lungs. He has been on a ventilator and has a nasal feeding tube for nourishment. This has been a very trying time for my family and my heart breaks especially for our two children, ten-year-old Tayven and ten-month-old Paysen. We are not certain what the future holds, but we do know that our lives will never be the same. There is no longer any sense of normalcy. It tears me apart to hear our ten-year-old say he is depressed and sad because there are so many things he still wanted to do with his dad that he won’t be able to do now. It also breaks my heart when our son asks questions like, “Who will ride bikes with me?” or makes statements such as, “Dad will miss Paysen’s first Christmas.” We miss Todd in even the simplest of things – from driving Tayven to school, to keeping Paysen calm in church, to cutting Tayven’s toe nails. We do know that our struggles emotionally and financially will be ongoing, as Todd will most likely never return to work. If rehab is an option, it will possibly require air transport to an out of state facility that can handle a patient with his needs. A long-term residential care facility is also a likely prospect. The chances of my husband ever returning home are very slim. This situation at hand results in major financial changes for my family. We want to provide whatever treatment options are available for Todd, but at the same time, we need to be able to provide for our kids. The outpouring of support from friends, family, co-workers, church members, and even strangers has been humbling. It is what keeps me going day after day. I truly feel as if I have an army behind me. The generosity of others has been absolutely amazing and something I will always cherish. So many have asked what they can do to help. At this point, the biggest area of concern is the long-term financial effects of the situation. We are establishing fundraising efforts through gofundme.com, as well as through our local bank. If you find it in your heart to donate to my family, please know that your donation will be used to keep my family afloat, whether it is in paying Todd’s medical bills, paying our mortgage, covering utilities, or putting food on the table. Thank you for taking the time to read our story. May God bless you and your family. Remember to always take the time to let your family members know how much you care about them.

As we post this, Ethan is currently at Wesley ICU with a Trumatic brain injury and multiple skull fractures. He is stable but critical.  This is the beginning of a long road to recovery and where we would appreciate your support.  First and foremost he needs your prayers.

  All donations collected will go towards the expenses that will occur during Ethan‘s road to recovery . This will include at minimum a $9,500 insurance deductible, transportation to a specialized rehab facility (that will be out of state and must be paid upfront), along with other related expenses.  Your prayers and support will be gratefully appreciated.  Thank you to all who have already been keeping Ethan, his family and friends in their thoughts and prayers.

All of you may or may not know Ken Kirchhofer, but he is a friend to many. He has helped countless veterans over the years with his fundraising efforts giving his heart and soul to the cause. Now it’s time to return the favor and show him how much we love and appreciate him.Ken was recently injured at home due to a fall. It was presumed he may have broken his neck and was rushed to the hospital where he underwent surgery on his C-Spine to relieve pressure on his spinal cord.This was a terribly freak accident leaving him without mobility to his lower extremities. 

Ken needs our support through rehab and physical therapy let alone emergency room and hospital bills. As a golf pro, Ken does not have health insurance. The Atascocita golf club do not supply health insurance for its employees which is pretty typical in the golf industry.



Ken is a fighter, but will need the support of family and friends while he works to overcome this event. We have all been praying for his full recovery and now it’s time to show him the support he has always given to the community.The funds we raise here to help Ken’s recovery will go directly to Ken and his wife Ruth Kirchhofer. Let’s show Ken how much he means to us all. Give what you can and give often. This is a long road ahead.

Within those 13 days, he was in afib too many times to count, had an infection that led to a six day fever, had fluid in his lungs, had multiple blood clots, was unresponsive when sedation was decreased and those are just the major problems that I can recall off the top of my head...On March 1st the doctors were able to take him off the ventilator and he could breathe on his own (with some help from oxygen). We were concerned about possible damage to his brain but were VERY happy to hear his sarcasm soon after the sedation wore off. Dad spent a few more days in the ICU with continuing complications. But thanks to the doctors and nurses, dad was finally on the mend.

On March 5th, dad was transferred into inpatient rehab facility as he was very weak after being sedated and ventilated for 13 days.

On March 10th, I picked my daddy up to take him home! Mom, Caitlin, Bear, Wrigley and I were all happy to have dad home and Beau was happy to have his granddad back 

Dad will start outpatient rehab next week. He is just starting his extensive recovery. He will be out of work for a long time, but working hard to get himself better. With one income and lots of medical bills, I ask you to consider donating to my wonderful parents. Those who know them know they are giving, loving, caring and too proud to ask for help, so I am asking for them.

Thank you for reading and thank you all for your support throughout this crazy month!

This is for the son of my dear friend Tracy Sheridan and family. This is their story...Our loving son, Corporal Kyle Mallory, A United States Marine Veteran, was involved in a horrific motorcycle accident on Tuesday, July 7thin Tucson, Arizona. Kyle is in a coma, on a respirator, and is in for the fight of his life right now…and due to the surge of COVID-19 in Arizona, I have not been allowed to enter the hospital to see my son. Not being able to see my son, touch him and tell him to be strong, tell him we love him and to FIGHT LIKE HELL, is tearing my heart apart. This has been truly devastating for myself, our family, and his brother Matt, also a Marine Veteran. We have tried desperately to plead with the administration, but they won’t let any of us see him. I am trying to get Kyle home, to be treated with his family around him, and need help.Kyle was on his way home from work, driving at a normal rate of speed and wearing his helmet when someone suddenly pulled out of a shopping plaza…they just didn’t see him coming. Kyle’s helmet does not have a scratch on it, but he is unresponsive, and on a ventilator due to severe head trauma. He suffered other injuries which were able to be surgically repaired, and will heal, but it’s too soon to know what his long-term prognosis will be. We are in the process of trying to have him transferred home to Westchester County for treatment. He has to fight to wake up and we have to be there to help him, encourage him and with anything that he may need.Unfortunately Kyle had just started his new job, and had a 3-month period without benefits. Wehad to apply for Arizona ""Emergency"" Medicaid. He does not have Tricare through the military because he separated before his second contract was completed. The Air Ambulance Flight from Arizona to New York will be an out of pocket expense for our family.Kyle is also a volunteer firefighter in his hometown in New York. He is also a Hendrick Hudson High School Graduate. He had recently moved to Tucson, found a job that he really enjoyed, great friends and a new found love of Strongman Competitions, which he excelled at. His brother and I will need to bring all of his belongings back to New York for him. Kyle will most likely be out of work for the foreseeable future.All donations will be used to get Kyle home, help with medical bills, and any rehab he will need. Because of his condition he needs to be transported on a medical air ambulance. Any little bit will help. If you are not in a position to help out, prayers for him are welcome. Any donations leftover will be donated to the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation, which benefits the families of fallen firefighters. Donations or cards can be sent to his mom, Tracy Sheridan, 613 Depew Street, Peekskill, NY 10566.Thank you with all of my heart,Angela Outhouse on behalf of Kyle Mallory and family#HopeforKyle #BringKyleHomeRead more"

Our family needs your financial supportHow we got here...On April 9th, 2018 my daughter, Mikala would receive a phone call that Karter @ 3months was found unresponsive. He would be ambulated over to Loyola Medical Center where in the ambulance bay he’d go into full cardiac arrest, after 7 rounds of atropine his body finally responds & he’s moved to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit where they’d work on him for another 6 hrs. After waiting 6 grueling hrs we were finally allowed to see him. This was not at all what we expected. Karter was hooked up to a ventilator. Life support.The Waiting Game....The next 72hrs would be very intense. Within that time Karter would begin to have seizures with swelling on the brain, now we werepresented with a very grim prognosis that he would not survive the weekend. But GOD had other plans.....Karter would spend the next 2 weeks on life supportheavily sedated surrounded by a heavy presence of family & friends. Karter is still unresponsive, EEG shows zero brain activity, no reflexes, no gag reflex, no reaction to light, he’s unable to breathe above the ventilator. They discuss withdrawing life support. Karters other grandmother (Yolanda) suggests weaning him off of the sedation meds, they agreed. As sedation meds are slowly decreased, he began to respond! His eyes were no longer locked & fixed in one direction, the swelling on his brain subsided, all his vitals were stable, only obstacle now was the ventilator. Meeting With His Medical Team...We were scheduled to meet with his medicalteam, which consisted of about 20 doctors, nurses & specialists, where they encourage us to remove him from the ventilator as caring for him would be a burden & his quality of life would be poor. But God had other plans....Withdrawal From Ventilator....On Thursday @ 8:30 am, a respiratory tech was scheduled to come around & remove Karter from his support to see if he could breath independently. Karter would immediately start breathing on his own @ 90%! They were shocked! Over the next couple days we stepped down from PICU. The next couple weeks we would see obvious signs of severe brain damage, Karter would be inconsolable, his eyes wouldn’t track, he was unable to latch on to a bottle, his muscles were weak & he had no head or neck control. Rehab....After fighting with the hospitals & having a feeding tube surgically placed, we were finally transferred to rehab. Because of poor insurance & their unwillingness to provide Karter with the therapy he deserved, rehab really didn’t benefit him. Where are we today?Karter is now 3. He’s nonverbal, non-mobile,visually impaired, feeding tube dependent, epileptic, cerebral palsy & struggles with hypothermia. He ages out of Early Intervention which are services provided by each state to individuals under 3. They include Physical, Vision, Feeding, Occupational Therapy & Infant Development, which brings us here....After 3 years of age there are no programs provided to individuals with disabilities other than preschool.

Go figure...Where we’re headed.....HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY (HBOT)Why it's done???Your body's tissues need an adequate supply of oxygen to function. When tissue is injured, it requires even more oxygen to survive. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy increases the amount of oxygen your blood can carry. With repeated scheduled treatments, the temporary extrahigh oxygen levels encourage normal tissue oxygen levels, even after the therapy is completed.Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used to treat several medical conditions. And medical institutions use it in different ways. Your doctor may suggest hyperbaric oxygen therapy if you have one of the following conditions:Severe anemiaBrain abscessBubbles of air in your blood vessels (arterial gas embolism)BurnsCarbon monoxide poisoningCrushing injuryDeafness, suddenDecompression sicknessGangreneInfection of skin or bone that causes tissue deathNonhealing wounds, such as a diabetic foot ulcerRadiation injurySkin graft or skin flap at risk of tissue deathTraumatic brain injuryVision loss, sudden and painlessSports injuriesHow YOU can help Baby Karter☺️These treatments are unfortunately not covered by our insurance & they don’t make them affordable for the average person. However,Through research & networking with other patients & hearing their testimonials this treatment has helped SO MANY babies & kids toimprove their lives after a traumatic brain injury. Karter would need 100 treatments, each treatment is $250.So we’d need to raise a total of $25,000! Will you join us in helping make this possible for Karter?? He so deserves it! I know this was a lot. Thank you for sticking in there. Thank you for reading our journey. Thank you for any help you can give! #KARTERSTRONG

It’s with great sadness we have lost Willow this morning 

At 2:30am we had to make the most difficult decision to say goodbye, unfortunately too many complications had set in and so quickly.

As of 6 pm yesterday her bloods were ok and she seemed stable, however by early evening sadly things had rapidly deteriorated.

The vet was called back in at 11pm, as the night staff who were watching her constantly were really worried. 

We received a call at 2 am after the vet had spent 3 hours with her.

Sepsis peritonitis had set in. They think she had developed a possible ulcer which had burst. She had been sick twice, a raised temperature and heart rate. 

Sadly they also confirmed earlier that day that the replacement tendons in her left paw had failed partly due to a different infection that was also eating away bits of her skin. This would result in her having to have the the twine removed and she would have had to face both legs being fused on Monday, but first they were really battling with the infections and needed to get that under control first.

The specialists confirmed they couldn’t just fuse one leg and they would have to do both as albeit the right was better than the left, there was too much flex in it, and with the other leg being fused it would put too much pressure on the joints on her right leg and it didn’t stand a chance. The right would have to over compensate and it would never heal. 

They would have had to carry out more emergency surgery at 7am today to find out what had burst and her lungs were also filling up, they think from the impact from the fall although all tests and scans to that point were and had been clear. 

There would have been a few more ops also plus her snapped lower K9 tooth to sort plus months of rehab.

The vet explained Willow she now had only a 1 in 10 chance of survival of the emergency surgery and was critically ill. 

Sadly as we all do we always put our fur babies needs above our own, we took guidance from the amazing vet specialist and had to let her run free. We couldn’t put her through anymore as we all felt she had been through enough. 

To say we are totally heartbroken is an understatement. We wouldn’t wish this on anybody. 

The vet cried when calling us as they had also fallen in love with her in such a short amount of time and couldn’t believe how amazing she had been with all that she had gone through. She still wanted her tummy rubbing and they gave her lots of cuddles and kisses .

We can’t put into words how devastated we are. 

Since we froze donations to the page last Saturday news has spread and we have received literally hundreds of messages from around the world asking us to open the page back up again so donations could be made. In light of the latest heartbreaking development we have decided to open the page again from the £16,135 that had aleady been raised so that donations can be collected on behalf of 'Beardies In Need' a charity who have been a huge support to us over the past 10 days. As we have always communicated any funds donated and surplus after Willow's treatments would be split to help other beardie collies who need help and a donation will also be made to The Guide Dogs To The Blind to support all the amazing work they do.

Donations can also be made direct to The Beardies In Need via PayPal to:

Thank you for all your kindness and support for Willow and ourselves over the past 10 days we have been left humbled and forever grateful. It's been totally impossible to reply to every message and everyone in person, but please be assured that we have taken the time to read them all. We now need to take this time to regroup as a family XXXRead more"

We were on the beach when Derek went into the water to do what he loves - body surf. Derek took on a big wave, that unfortunately pushed his head into the ground and paralyzed him from the neck down. Once we were able to get him out of the water and onto the beach there was an ER doctor who happened to be near us on the beach waiting to help. Derek went into cardiac arrest on the beach and as Fire and Rescue arrived they quickly took him to an ambulance and were able to revive him. Once in the ambulance paramedics were able to intubate him and made the decision to take him to the trauma center in Atlantic City (AtlantiCare Medical) due to concerns about his neck. Upon arrival a full body CT scan was done and revealed that Derek had broken his C4, C5, and C6 vertebrae. These bones were crushed and putting pressure on his spinal cord, so the decision was made to operate on him immediately that evening. The surgery went as well as could be expected with the doctor noting that he suffered an incomplete spinal injury (meaning the cord is not severed or cut). Due to COVID-19 procedures at this time, only Derek's mother is able to visit him for the duration of his stay here in Atlantic City from 11am-1pm and 5pm-7pm. Since that first night, we have experienced many ups and downs already with Derek. Derek has had another surgery to stabilize his back and a tracheotomy procedure as he works to get off of the ventilator. We were all elated to find that he was awake that first morning and able to answer questions after there were many concerns about possible brain injury. Over time we have found through Krista's visits that Derek is still very much himself, despite the trauma he has been through and is still experiencing. He has gained back feeling in his arms and hands, but still unable to move his hands or anything below his chest. His spinal cord is still swollen, and as the swelling decreases over time we will have a better idea of his limitations. At this time we don't know for sure what Derek's recovery will look like, but we know that he is strong, stubborn, and when he puts his mind to something he is determined to get it. All of these things, along with the fact that his injury was an ""incomplete"" one give us hope that Derek can work towards a great recovery. This will be a very long road to recovery for him and many have asked how they can help us. All donations made on Derek's behalf will go directly towards his hospital bills, transportation, and any rehab/equipment related needs Derek will have going forward. If it is not within your means to give financially, we ask that you please continue to pray for Derek, his family, and myself as we navigate the many challenges ahead during this recovery.

I never expected to be one to request help.When Covid-19 started to go around my wife and I took it very seriously. We hardly ever left the house, when we did we always wore a mask, and more likely then not we had groceries and food delivered. We knew if either one of us contracted Covid-19 it would be bad for both of us. We also wanted to protect our family and in home business. Despite all of our efforts we failed and allowed a family member to bring the Virus into the house.There is no worse feeling in the world then the inability to protect your loved ones. Delta and I have been married for over 23 years and throughout that time there have been our share of ups and downs. I have not always been the perfect husband nor the person Delta deserves, but each and every day she has been the perfect mother, the best friend and always the supportive wife. She found special joy in our kids and grandchildren and would do anything to make them happy. She always put friends and family first and her needs were always second. Her personal joys in life were gardening year around in our greenhouse until our HOA made us take it down and being able to ride her 3 wheeled Can Am Spyder.Delta contracted Covid-19 on November 14th and tested positive on November 16th. I tested positive on the 17th and 6 other members of our family in the following days. We tried to keep out of the hospital but by the 23rd Delta was starting to become seriously ill. We tried to support each other because everything you hear is people die from Covid-19 at the hospital. By the 27th we were both in very bad shape. I drove myself to my Doctor and was asked if I wanted to live or die. I told them I wanted to save my wife. I was taken to the Hospital via ambulance as I made arrangements to get Delta to the Emergency Room. This is the last time I have seen her. I was lucky enough to respond well to treatment and was released on Dec 2nd the day that Delta's lungs couldn't continue to hold out and the Doctors were forced to intubate her. There is nothing worse then knowing that you failed to protect the one person that makes you smile, that you are completely powerless to change the course of action, and that it's possible that you could never say ""I Love You"" again. I don't come to you lightly to ask for help. I believe most of Delta's medical and hopefully rehab bills will be covered, but you never realize other expenses that pile up especially when the two people supposed to be taken care of everything fall sick. I do believe in paying it forward and any funds that might be left over will go towards the next family in need.I thank you for your time and wish what ever god or entity that guides your life blesses you.Read more"

This occured June 19th and on June 29th Lyla went into surgery to freeze the tumor (cryoblation) which is shown to be more effective and safer treatment than just surgically removing it.  After 6 hours of surgery, Lyla didn't wake in the expected amount of time and began having trouble breathing. They had to intabate her again and rushed her into a MRI and found that her spinal cord had been damaged by the freezing temperature extending to the spinal cord.  This has never been a complication from this type of procedure before. The injury to her spinal cord caused her to not be able to breath on her own and be paralyzed from her neck down. On July 14th Lyla made a big step towards moving out of ICU with a tracheostomy. She still requires a ventilator attached to her trach as well as a GI tube for nourishment. She should soon graduate from PICU (Pediatric Intensive Care Unit) and move upstairs to inpatient rehab where she is expected to stay approximately 4-6 weeks, possibly longer. When we visited Michigan last week, we were able to go to the arboretum near the children’s hospital. From the little hill we could see her room but she couldn’t see us yet. Maybe when she gets to rehab she can look at us through a window. We were able to visit separately with her parents who have been staying at the hospital.Her parents have accrued and will continue to incur medical bills. They will need to have a handicap van which will be an additional cost. Also, they need to modify their home making a bedroom and a handicap bathroom on the main floor. These costs are above what their insurance will cover and what they can financially handle. We are asking for your help and seeking donations to help cover some of these out of pocket expenses. We are starting our fundraising goal of $75,000.Some days are harder than others for Lyla. She has anxiety and this is a whole new area which she needs to work through in life. As she put it, “I’m tired of this paralyzation.”With a little help, we can make this burden lighter. Your help will help her parents focus on her needs and getting the home and transportation ready for her.Read more"

Prayers are also requested and welcomed.https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2021/02/19/houstonian-fighting-for-his-life-after-being-burned-trying-to-help-friend-light-fireplace/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=snd&utm_content=kprc2Read more"

In 2014, about a week after finding out that we were pregnant with our son, a howitzer backed over his right foot/ankle and broke 27 bones. He had 7 surgeries to repair his foot/ankle but still lives in constant pain every day and has limited range of motion. He developed a condition called RSD. The key symptom is, chronic, intense pain that gets worse over time rather than better. This condition is labeled online as the suicide disease because of how miserable it makes people. Doctors wanted to amputate but were afraid that the RSD would make him swell too much to be able to fit a prosthetic. Friday, March 5th, Tyler was in a bad car accident on his way to work. He broke his left femur and tore muscles in his right knee. He had to have surgery on his leg and shortly afterwards he started coughing up blood, experiencing chest pain and was very short of breath. He had to be on oxygen and moved to the ICU for ""intubation watch"". The doctors suspected a blood clot in his lungs but after tests ruled that out. They now think that he aspirated during his surgery and damaged his lungs. Because of his condition with already having one very bad leg/foot and now a new bad leg, they are most likely going to have to send him to a rehab facility instead of straight home when he is able to get out of the hospital.Medical bills are piling up and we will need to make lots of accommodations for him once he is able to return home. Basic things are going to be very difficult for a while and he will need lots of help. Neither of us are getting to work and family members have been taking off work to help us as well. Tyler is such an amazing husband, dad, person, and very hard worker. He is the strongest person I know, but after nearly 7 years of chronic pain, he is very tired. He is tired of hurting and now he has much more pain and a long road ahead of him. The last thing I want is for him to have to worry about our finances during this already troublesome time. Anything will help, even if all you can do is share our story.Read more"

After a few days with increasing breathing difficulties they moved her to the ICU. After 5 days of trying various medications unsuccessfully, she was intubated, put on the ventilator, and heavily sedated. In under a week, COVID had seized control of her body very quickly. Typical of so many COVID patients, she was unable to see her family and they were unable to see her. At one point, Ken was told she had around a 5% chance of survival. It has been gut-wrenching watching our brother Ken and his 3 kids (Kelsey, Brandon, and Josh) dealing with the fear of losing her.After 14 days, things seemed to be progressing for what appeared the better as Becky was no longer contagious, and the family was finally allowed to see her. Ken, a devoted and loving husband wasted no time and has now been living every night in the hospital to be close to her talking incessantly to her. When friends sent a little gas and meal money, Ken, being incredibly selfless, instead used the money to feed dinner to two different shifts of hospital workers who have tirelessly kept her alive. During the day, he stays for the doctor updates and then leaves to do some work and then to return to catch doctors in the early evening.Becky, has been heavily sedated, actually medically paralyzed for much of the last 5 weeks. She developed a serious case of ARDS from the COVID virus. She is hooked up to life support, has a feeding tube and an enormous volume of medications and monitors. During the last few weeks, it has been up and down with good days and bad days. She has opened her eyes a few times bringing much hope to her despairing family and friends. Unfortunately, both lungs collapsed in separate events requiring chest tubes to be surgically implanted to drain air/fluids from her chest. She also caught an infection which needed to be treated with antibiotics. Her blood pressure has some crazy swings requiring interventions. At one point, they feared a stroke and did CT scans of the brain and chest. Then the latest punch to our fighting warrior, is the doctors discovered that they had inadvertently ruptured her silicone breast implant when inserting the chest tube (a week before). The implant had been inserted after her double mastectomy years ago during her Breast Cancer battle.As you might imagine, her children are struggling to cope with the situation and missing Becky tremendously. Becky and Ken’s dogs (Max and Zeke) are incredibly sad not having mom and dad to cuddle and are constantly looking for Becky to walk through the door.The plan of action, once she is stable enough, is to do a tracheotomy which will allow her to move to a long-term acute care facility where they will work on weaning her off the vent and hopefully reversing Trach and PEG (feeding tube), etc. assuming her lungs are not too damaged. She has not moved in almost 6 weeks. The road to recovery will be tremendously hard, painful, emotional and financially draining. She will require pulmonary rehab, physical therapy, occupational therapy, cognitive therapy, speech therapy and probably significant emotional support.Becky has worked hard to beat the odds to stay alive. Her warrior strength battled and defeated breast cancer 8 years ago and she will beat this as well, but she needs our help. Please continue to pray and consider to help fund her medical bills. - 6+ weeks in ICU ($4,000 minimum plus unknown amount of any doctors or services that were considered out of network)-   Anticipated therapy costs above what insurance will cover. It is anticipated that recovery will take months starting in a long-term acute facility graduating to a rehab/skilled nursing facility and then hopefully home with some degree of home care/out-patient therapy. Insurance limits number of therapy sessions to 20 in a given calendar year. She will exceed that amount very quickly as she tries to learn how to breathe on her own and walk and talk after weeks of not doing either. Preliminary estimates of therapy services not covered by insurance will easily exceed $36,000.-    Missing income - Becky will be unable to work for quite a long time. She will be eligible for unemployment pay but this will not cover her full income as a hard-working server, which is highly tip based. This missing income is estimated at $10,000+. - It is also very likely she will require several medications for a long time that will probably exceed insurance coverage. - We also hope and pray (and are assuming for now) that she does not need inpatient facility care beyond what her insurance coverage allows. We will not know about this for awhile.Please consider helping support Becky, our courageous COVID warrior and loving mother of 3! Any small amount would be helpful and much appreciated. And, if you cannot afford to donate, no worries please just help by praying for her recovery.Read more"

I'm asking for help because I'm in a worse-case scenario. I have recently become homeless after losing my housing in the middle of this pandemic and have had ongoing trouble finding work because of my employment barriers. I am non-binary and have c-PTSD and do not feel safe staying at any shelters, so I've been couch surfing (yes I know this is risky during this time), sleeping in my car, and camping in forests since Mid-June. I have family in Iowa I can stay with for a while, and close friends/a partner in Rochester I can live with - but I need help funding the move. This means either shipping my belongings, paying for gas, and servicing my car for a long trip - or renting a Uhaul truck, paying for gas, and towing my car behind. Both options will cost upwards of $1500.UPDATE! Because I was told towing my car was a bad idea due to my inexperience, I chose the option of shipping my mailable belongings/servicing my car/road tripping it, and I chose VERY wrong. After spending most of the gofundme money on doing this (including getting my car serviced) I'm now having transmission trouble RIGHT before I'm ready set off. I do not have enough money left to fix my transmission ($1500-$2500) or rent a Uhaul now. I am VERY scared my car is going to break down on my way to Rochester, even though my transmission is only in the beginning stages of failure. At the very bottom below are the costs of everything I've done thus far, for those keeping tabs.Before June, I was living with my mother since August 2019 after having surgery, but she sold the house and moved to Vermont, leaving me here. She had told me this was her plan since before I moved in and the expectation was that I would be able to get on my feet and land a job and my own housing before her move date. This, obviously, did not happen. I am sitting on OVER A HUNDRED job applications currently. In October I got the ball rolling by working with Vocational Rehab and the employment department about the options for my skillset and ability, and decided to pursue phlebotomy (and ideally lab technician specifically). I was able to get a scholarship to take a phlebotomy technician course and obtain my CPT certificate. I graduated with a 97.5 and loved the work.Then the pandemic hit. I can't even land temp work. I have 3 caseworers (2 at voc rehab and 1 at Worksource) who know all of this and have been trying to help me find work and they are at their wit's end, just as frustrated as I am.A little more background - I have mutiple employment barriers, including a very specific skillset. I excel at detailed-oriented work, solitary work, using my hands, being creative, good with animals, one-on-one client interaction where there is mutual respect, and following specific protocols. I have autism, which I was diagnosed with at 4, that I've had support for since childhood but still struggle with many sensory and interpersonal issues in typical work environments. I'm also non-binary and have notorious issues fitting in and have faced harassment and discrimination. I have c-PTSD, anxiety, attention span/short term memory issues, and situational depression that has gotten steadily worse and impacts my energy levels badly. I've worked a variety of jobs (dishwasher, cashier, factory, warehouse, customer service/sales, janitorial, to name a few), mostly temp, and because of my difficulties I also end up getting fired or getting my hours cut severely. I would excel at the right kind of job, but can not seem to get hired. So here we are.Once I get to Rochester I plan on securing income, but even if it takes me years to do so I will not be homeless. Being homeless as added another barrier to obtaining income here and my only real otion is to leave. Anything you can spare to help me do so, would be infintely appreciated.Thank you.Expenses so far:-Servicing my car: $300-Diagnostics for transmission issue: $125-Phone bill: $205-Storage unit for July: $70-Trips to/from Salem Gas: $150 (Had to empty my storage unit in Salem, an hour away from where I'm couch surfing. Belongings are currently in a friend's spare room) Trips took roughly $20 each trip and it took a week to empty the unit because I have a car and not a truck.-Gas, other: $150-UPS: $200-USPS: $400-Amtrakshipping: $115-Foods: $60 ( I ran out of foodstamps early because road-friendly foods tend to be more expensive and I am avoiding grocery stores as much as possible)-Medication, Hygeine supplies, random needs such as new charger cord: $50*Special thank you to Troy for taking my mattress (and tying it up like a sub), Harvest for letting me safely store my moped, my dad for taking care of my insurance, Grandma C and Uncle Ben for the support, River for letting me hoard up your spare room, and Shelby, River, Rowan B., and Kaeleo for letting me sleep on your couches during a literal pandemic, and last but not least Xanthe, Rowan J, Seran, and Vaal for giving me a way out of this situation.

He had emergency surgery on December 18th to remove the tumor that was bleeding in his brain. Since then Vince has bravely been battling the cancer with chemo and radiation therapy. Unfortunately it is progressing rapidly and he has also suffered a stroke causing him to lose most mobility, independent function, and vision. Vince's three children Jon, Gaetano, and Alexandra have been by his side supporting him through this all. Because of Covid they were not able to visit him in the long term rehab facility he was placed. They worked hard to set up a hospital bed, home modifications, and home health visits so that Vince could be comfortable at home and feel the love and support of his family. All of this has caused not only a heavy emotional strain, but financial as well. Vince lost his job due to his declining health prior to his surgery and was not insured at the time. Jon, Guy, and Alex have taken over financial responsibility for Vince's health and home expenses and have needed to take multiple leaves from workin order to take turns being home with him as he needs 24 hour care at this time. We can't take away the pain this has caused Vince and his family but I am hoping to help alleviate some stress in any way that I can. Please consider donating any amount you can to keep Vince comfortable and surrounded by loved ones (and holding his first grandchild soon as Alex is due to have a baby girl any day now! <3)Thank you thank you to all who have reached out in support and prayers for Vince and his family!Read more"

The amount of time that had elapsed between the stroke occurring, then getting airlifted to Melbourne and receiving medical assistance meant that the news was not good. Through extensive testing it revealed that the stroke was caused by carotid webbing that affects normal blood flow to the brain, accompanied by an irregular and periodic heartbeat. Something that he never knew was a ticking time bomb. Steve’s brain was very swollen, which is expected following a clot that was left unattended to for so long. The stroke was large and located on the right side of his brain, meaning the areas around the stroke are needing to take on what the lost brain tissue used to do… success of this is unpredictable. Once stabilized and transferred to Wangaratta Hospital, he needed supported overhead tracking and four people to help him transfer from a hospital bed to a wheelchair. To watch such a capable man unable to look after himself on any level, including having to be fed has been heartbreaking to say the least. He was disoriented, unsure of what was happening and with paralysis down his left side it has left his family extremely worried and unsure of what his future holds. He still has no movement down the left side of his body, and a strong deficit which means his brain has forgotten to be aware of the left side of his world entirely. Steve’s working memory and cognitive function have been affected, with his orientation to time and place fluctuating, often thinking he is on the slopes, surfing or somewhere he’d much rather be. Now months later, the reality of Steve’s condition has set in. The rehab team have confirmed that Steve will need 24/7 care for the rest of his life. Whilst we hold hope for recovery, we are planning for the harsh reality that Steve will need much more support than we could ever have imagined. Further from the extensive medical costs that will follow him through his life, he will need modified living arrangements, disability vehicles, ongoing occupational therapy and many more things that our beloved Steve most definitely never budgeted for. Steve currently requires physical assistance or supervision for all daily living activities and will require a lot of support through the rest of his healing journey.Whilst the government, through The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) are covering basics, they can’t help him regain any semblance of the life he once lead. Steve has always been self-motivated, hence his incredible feats as an athlete. We can be confident knowing that he will push himself to his absolute limit and beyond. His drive for life and health have not been altered, but now we’re appealing to you to join in and help Steve get back some of the life he built for himself and one he would still be proud of leading, for this he really needs our help.For more information & regular weekly updates, please refer to the Facebook page Steve Lee's Support Tribe -https://www.facebook.com/Steve-Lees-Support-Tribe-104025528126738& @skiingwithstevelee on Instagramhttps://www.instagram.com/skiingwithstevelee/All donations are tax deductible.#steveleefightbackSteve Lee’s Support Tribe ❄️Read more"

As my world crumbled around me, the doctor explained that my wife had suffered an Intraventricular Hemorrhage (IVH) in her brain. When asked whether it was a stroke, the doctor said “This event is significantly worse than a stroke and is very likely not survivable. Tremendous intracranial pressure has developed that is crushing her brain. Without intervention, your wife will die.” Confused and terrified, I looked down at my comatose, intubated wife who was completely nonresponsive. To think, that night (September 25th) we had gone to bed, our three children slumbering with not a care in the world, and now everything was in complete disarray - our plans and dreams shattered to pieces in a few short hours. Overcoming the Odds  • Mother of 3 beautiful children  • Friend and mentor to the community  • Kind, loving, and caring partner  • Active church member  • Determined and fierce Mama BearThose are just a few ways to describe Jane. She is also an incredible woman who never backs down from a challenge. Over the next few weeks, the medical staff was able to relieve and regulate the incredibly high intracranial pressures that her entire brain and brain stem were experiencing. After two weeks of very skilled care and countless prayers, Jane had survived the Intraventricular Hemorrhage! While we now had a renewed sense of hope, we learned that the IVH had caused a massive stroke (technically, a Deep Nuclei Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury - HIBI) while the blood vessels in Jane’s brain were squeezed shut by high intracranial pressure. Jane’s doctors became more pessimistic with time and said they couldn’t provide a medical prediction until Jane woke. Eventually, one individual went as far as to inform us that we should expect Jane never to wake and to spend the rest of her days in a nursing home.However, there is another word to describe my wife… she is a fighter! On November 25th, nearly 2 months after the initial event, her physician noted that Jane was becoming aware and responding to her environment…Jane was awake! Now, we had an attainable goal… to get our “Mama Bear” back to her cubs!What’s Next for Jane?Since Jane’s waking, our journey to recovery has been riddled with bumps, bruises, and curveballs. From the insurance company fighting us on every decision to our three elementary-aged children’s ongoing care, the only thing certain was that my wife would not give up, and we were not yet defeated! Twice, Jane needed to be transferred to another program to receive the care her doctors prescribed, and twice the insurance company denied that care and tried to send her to a nursing home because her treatment did not meet their criteria for “Medical Necessity.” We were granted miracles each time. Jane fought hard and improved just enough at the 11th hour that an appeal from her doctors was successful, and the insurance company reversed their decision. Another miracle was on December 8th, when Jane was admitted to Craig Hospital in Colorado – one of the best Neuro Rehab Hospitals for brain injury anywhere. Jane was transported from Raleigh, NC to Colorado on December 14th (12 years to the day of when we flew to Colorado for our honeymoon), and we are currently participating in intense in-patient neuro rehab. Jane has been working with multiple therapists every day trying to relearn how to speak and move her body the way she wants. The medical staff has noted that she comprehends, but she just can’t make herself heard. For the last 3 months, I’ve spoken for her and I can’t wait to hear our Mama Bear Roar!Cost FactorsWhile Jane continues to improve, our family has a long road ahead of us regardless of how much function Jane is able to recover. After completing the Inpatient Neuro Rehab program in Colorado, there is Outpatient Neuro Rehab. Then, stroke recovery continues slowly due to the natural healing that occurs as someone works to overcome the challenges of daily living. At Craig Hospital, I’m required to participate in Jane’s therapy while she heals and relearns. It’s a full-time job, and I’m learning how to support and care for her when she returns home. With caring for our three children, I’m not able to return to my normal job. Needless to say, our family’s needs are mounting.Specific Costs:  • Living Costs – house payments, utilities, and everything else associated with keeping our household running in North Carolina  • Housing Costs in Colorado (1600 miles from our home) while in Neuro Rehab   • Child Care – There are times when I’m caring for Jane that I cannot be physically present to care for our children   • Uncovered Medical Costs – Some tests and procedures associated with Jane’s care are not covered by our insurance. From insurance loopholes that deny claims to be necessary and quickly performed procedures that occur without preauthorization, the bills are piling up  • Home Modifications/ Moving Costs – Our home is not accessible. We will need to either remodel it or move to a different home that will accommodate Jane’s needs  • Accessible Vehicle – Jane will need to be able to get into and out of our vehicle. It is unlikely that she will get that far in 2 months  • Continual Insurance Appeal Costs – Brain injury rehabilitation is a slow process. Jane’s doctors have warned me to expect ups and downs, good weeks and bad weeks. Medical Necessity is reassessed weekly, so insurance has the opportunity to deny Jane’s care every week moving forward. We hope our insurance company will be fair, but because of the pattern so far, I’ve engaged a law firm to help with the anticipated ongoing appeals  • Rehabilitation Costs After a Future Neurosurgery to Repair the Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM) that bled to cause the Intraventricular Hemorrhage (IVH) that caused the Deep Nuclei Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury (HIBI). Jane survived the IVH and is fighting to overcome the HIBI, but the AVM is still there and cannot be addressed right now without putting an end to Jane’s recovery from the strokeJane is and will continue to fight and reclaim every inch possible on her road to recovery. Family is incredibly important to her... she is the epitome of a “Mama Bear” and will do anything to return home to our children. (In fact, Jane is one of the fiercest mama bears I've known.) While we don’t know the future of Jane’s recovery, each donation on this page will help her and our family with the ever-mounting needs as we face this challenge.

This is a short story about my beautiful niece Zahli Habel who has just been diagnosed with Ewing’s Sarcoma in her left leg. She is a vibrant, happy go lucky, gorgeous 10-year-old girl who deserves a happy and healthy life. This very rare type of cancerous tumor grows in your bones or soft tissue around your bones such as cartilage or the nerves. She has recently started chemotherapy in Adelaide which will take up to 6 or 7 months. This treatment will shrink the tumor, as well as an operation that will consist of removing part of her infected tibia and replacing it with a titanium rod. She will then need more chemotherapy, physiotherapy, and rehab to get her back on her feet again. As a result of this, her beautiful family will have to spend extended time away from Streaky Bay while she has her treatment. Zahli will be away from her family and friends and will not be able to attend school in Streaky Bay. This being the toughest battle the family has yet to fight.Jason, Steph and brothers Connor and Kai are a massive part of our small community. Her parents have done so much for this township and surrounding areas. With Jason being a volunteer ambulance officer and Steph being a physiotherapist, they have each helped many of us throughout our troubles and family emergencies. Now is the time we need to give back to them and help support their beautiful family. As many people have already asked how they can help, we have put together this page to raise money towards helping Zahli and her family fight this fight as one. The family were very reluctant to do this but have been overwhelmed by the generous love and offers of support from the community and now realize how amazing Streaky Bay is as a community.So, if you could please help in any way, we would be forever grateful. All donations will go into a trust fund for Zahli and towards the cost of future treatment.On behalf of my brother Jason & sister in-law Steph, your generosity and love will be greatly appreciated.With love,Toni, Rayleen, Family and Friends xxRead more"

For those of you that don’t know Emmy, let me just say…You. Are. Missing. Out. She is selfless, thoughtful, patient, beautiful, intelligent and the most dependable person I know. I first met Emmy when she began her teaching career at a school in Federal Way, WA. We taught first grade on the same team and, unlike most first year teachers I know, she took on every single challenge that was thrown her way with a positive attitude. She was always smiling, incredibly calm, extremely patient and disgustingly optimistic.  I knew from the beginning that there was something magical about this lady. Since then, she has grown to be a dear friend of mine who would drop everything in a pinch (and has, for the record) if I needed her. She is quite literally an angel on Earth. This past summer, Emmy began getting intense headaches. As the frequency and duration of her headaches increased, she began noticing that her balance was off, too. Not thinking too much of it, Emmy scheduled a visit with her doctor where they did some routine check-ups. Just to be safe, she also scheduled an MRI, being as Emmy had brain surgery in high school where she had a tumor removed. She was told it was benign and wouldn’t grow back, but, best to be safe. Emmy was at my house the day before Thanksgiving and we spent the day getting beautiful flowers (we’re obsessed with Fernseed’s new stem bar), making a delicious apple pie (or trying), and watching the Bachelorette (guilty pleasure). She left early to go get her MRI done and called shortly after to update me on how it went—quicker than she remembered and “not so bad” (I told you, always positive). Thanksgiving came and went and Friday morning I got a call from Emmy.Her MRI results came back and showed she had a large tumor on her cerebellum. As you can imagine, Thanksgiving weekend quickly transformed into days of meeting with doctors and scheduling surgery. Over that same weekend, Emmy had to say goodbye to her class of little first grade loves, as she is unable to work through this. A couple days later, she underwent brain surgery on December 1st, which was followed by several days at the hospital. There were some bumps in the road post-surgery, but she was transferred to inpatient rehab after a week in the ICU. There, she was able to start physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy, which consumed most of her days. Oh, did I mention she also ate a lot of cookies? She was able to do that, too. In all this crazy, the pathology report came back that Emmy’s tumor was back. She was diagnosed with a very rare and aggressive type of cancer—Anaplastic Pilocytic Astrocytoma. It is a high-grade level 3 tumor, meaning it is on the verge of level 4. When she called to tell me this, in true Emmy fashion, she told me it’s not worth being sad over (yeah, okay…see? she’s incredibly selfless and amazing) and that when she beats this, she’ll be famous and in all the textbooks. Emmy was able to connect with an oncologist who is one of two doctors in Washington state that have treated patients with this type of cancer. Being that it is so rare, there were a few different options as far as treatment plans went. Emmy was cleared to head home on December 19th, just in time for Christmas, (if you know Emmy, you know this was very, very important) where the following days were figuring out next steps in her treatment plan.Since being home, Emmy’s weeks have been absolutely filled with eye doctor appointments, oncology appointments, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, the list goes on and on. She opted to go with starting radiation in January, where she gets to re-evaluate and talk about next steps with her oncologist after the six weeks. She has been going to radiation everyday during the week and has been making improvements on walking, speech and mobility in fine motor tasks, such as writing or tying shoes…things you and I take for granted every single day. Her last radiation appointment is set for March 4th then she will meet with her oncologist on March 11th to check how her body responded and determine next steps. All this to be said that Emmy’s journey is far from over. We will see what next steps entail once she meets with her oncologist next month. Medical expenses add up insanely fast in this healthcare system and this journey is definitely no exception. There is a teacher that Emmy was able to connect with who underwent brain surgery earlier last year and her surgery cost her upwards of $583,000!! Emmy is unable to finish out this school year and will be unable to work next year, too. In the meantime, Axel has been working his tail off and she has been receiving unconditional love and support from him, her family, and friends. We are hoping the donations from this GoFundMe can provide even the smallest relief and alleviate some stress in all the expenses being thrown their way during this time. A donation in any amount will be much appreciated and I know Emmy + Axel will be forever grateful for your generosity and thoughtfulness.

She is a kind, adventurous, fiercely independent woman and athlete whose life changed irremediably in a few seconds as the sun rose over the ridge one morning a few weeks ago. Edie needs our help now. Last year, Edie moved from New York City to Los Angeles to pursue a new job opportunity and embrace the free-spirited, outdoor life that perfectly complements her passions: long-distance cycling and marathon running. On April 20, 2017 while on a solo morning bike ride, Edie was hit head-on by an SUV. The driver was momentarily blinded by the sun. Edie broke seven vertebrae in her neck and back and 11 ribs; her legs were torn up, her spine crushed. Her bike helmet is in eight pieces; it is truly a miracle we still have her with us. Since the accident she has had several emergency surgeries. Edie is currently paralyzed from the chest down as a result of her spinal cord injury. She still wears the metal halo brace, to help her heal. As she said, she is super-lucky to have ""all her marbles"". And she really does. Recovery from this kind of accident is often painful, lonely, and overwhelming. In addition to a daily regimen of PT, OT and other therapies, Edie is handling mountains of paper work, insurance claims, legal issues, and worrying who will care for her beloved cats. We expect her insurance settlement will barely cover a year of her recovery. And her expenses mount by the day.According to the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, the yearly expense for someone with a spinal cord injury like Edie’s (paraplegia) is $113,423. Many expenses and treatments are simply not covered at all: home modifications to accommodate a wheelchair; adapting a vehicle to be driven with hand controls; ongoing out-of-network healthcare needs; and the best rehab she can get.If you know Edie you know she is dead set on 100% movement of her arms and hands and mastering that wheelchair (you know she will). Every day she progesses a little further: pulling herself up in bed, getting in and out of a wheelchair. Paralysis and no feeling in her core makes this unfathomably hard and slow work. She's told us that every night she thinks about the increments of progress she is making. It is her hope that one day she will be able to move to a rehab facility that specializes in spinal cord injuries. After that she will move to a ‘transitional’ house where she will learn – living with others with similar injuries – how to regain her everyday freedom and independence: cooking, bathing, driving, and living her best life.Reminder: we’re talking about Edie. Edie Perkins! The woman who some years ago got on her bicycle in Portland, Oregon one day then RODE TO BROOKLYN!!We have all said it to each other since we heard about the accident: if anyone can do this, Edie can. If anyone can face the hardest physical challenge of their life, Edie can. If anyone can find the strength, Edie can.Her grit and focus humbles us all.Edie deserves the best. We started this fund because of you. We created this fund in response to all the messages: from those who have run with her, cycled with her, lived with her, worked with her, and loved her, and want to help. Every single donation will go directly to Edie and will be used at her discretion for her recovery. We want to ensure she gets the best from our health care system, insurance company assistance, or a tricked-out racing wheelchair. We are here to support her as she continues her long-held tradition of sailing out front, while we eat her dust, as she carries on with the determination we’ve come to expect.We want to ensure that she has the best chance to recover to be her best body and best self. It will be long; and it will be grueling.Please show her the love. Donate Now.Thank you for all the kindness, prayers, visits, and positive messages so many of you have sent and shared. to Edie. Please keep up the missives of support and motivation to her. She truly loves hearing from each of you. We promise to keep you updated regularly on Edie’s progress. We know how many people are rooting for her. Let's do this and help Edie regain an independent, active, and beautiful life.

Although it sent me into full big sister bear mode and ready to attack (I think the lack of sleep/food over the past 3 days didn't help that reaction) it made me realize that this has gone so much further than just our friends and family which is only as far as I had expected it to go. For that reason, I've decided not to respond to unneccessary negativity and to update the description with a little more details. My family has been absolutely overwhelmed by love and support the last few days from friends, family, and complete strangers that I think you deserve to know more about the beautiful kids you're praying for. On Tuesday, October 25th my little sister Kirsten (16) and my little brother Elias (13) dropped a very good friend off at his home around 4:45pm-my Dad just happened to be at that house at the time. They both gave my dad big goofy grins and waved before driving off. About ten minutes later my dad started hearing sirens. He looked at the kids' friend (Jacob) and said that can't be them the timing is too quick, as a pit started forming in his stomach. Jacob told him that he would drive down the road to see just to double check. A few minutes later Jacob called his house and confirmed that the accident was Kirsten. A little over a mile away from where they had just dropped him off something happened that caused her to over correct, roll her Chevy Blazer multiple times down the highway before it rolled down an embankment and slammed full force into a tree on Elias' door. Both were unconscious at the scene, had to be cut out of the car and flown to St Louis Children's Hospital 2 hours away from their home in small town Salem, MO. I won't repeat the details of their injuries as they are already listed in the many updates my Dad and Stepmom have been posting that I share on this page. What all our friends and family already know, is that we are two weeks away from the 13 year anniversary of when our older brother Ryan ""J.R."" Strebe and his girlfriend died in a horrific car accident. Having my two youngest siblings in critical condition with severe traumatic brain injuries from another car accident is indescribable. Kirsten is not another 16 year old reckless driver, she is more aware than most as far as what can happen when behind the wheel. These children are two of the most intelligent, compassionate, respectful, and loving kids I have ever known in my life-and I'm not just saying that because they are my siblings. They have both skipped grades in school and both have held straight A's since Kindergarten. Very active in different sports and school programs. They both have scored extremely well on their ACT exams. Elias was requested by Duke University to take his ACT in the 7th grade to be a part of their scholastic talent search program. Kirsten was just awarded a Regent Scholarship and accepted into the honors program at South East Missouri University where she was planning on majoring in forensic chemistry with a minor in criminology. She is currently ranked number one in her senior class with a 4.0 GPA (she has maintained a 4.0 GPA throughout her entire high school experience.) I could only daydream about being half as intelligent and as full of promise as these two are. It has made me absolutely sick to my stomach that I had to even create this page. Neither my Dad nor my Stepmom (Kirsten and Elias' mom) requested me to do this, knew I was going to do this, nor would even ask anyone for money. Money is the last thing they are even thinking about and honestly, I asked my dad last night if he had looked at the page and seen all of the people who had contributed and he said he hadn't even opened it up yet. I had to make him sit down for a few minutes and scroll through so he could read some of the love and support comments we've received from all of you. I am truly blown away by everyone's generosity in our time of need and it is appreciated way more than I can even put into words. In my haste to create the page I had made a statement that the two of them could be spending weeks in the hospital if things go well and who knows how long if things continue the way they are. Wishful thinking I suppose. Finally getting to the hospital myself and listening to the doctors and the nurses and having the reality of the severity of this situation hit me full on I realize just how wrong I truly was. We do not have one, but TWO children in critical condition with severe TBI's among many, many other serious issues and multiple fractures throughout each of their bodies. Neither of them are stable, neither have regained consciousness since the accident, and neither can even breath on their own at this time. They are both looking at no less than months in the hospital if things go well and an unknown amount of time in rehab afterwards. We have absolutely no idea what their condition will be in the future. A miracle could happen and they may fully recover months down the road but the possibility of staying in a vegetative state has unfortunately not been taken off the table yet. There is absolutely no way that insurance will cover all let alone most of this for two children. My father was forced into retirement about 17 years ago due to a back injury and is unable to work. My stepmom will without a doubt lose her job as she will not be able to leave her two children in a hospital 2+ hours away while they are in the critical condition they are. I created this page as a way to let them focus fully on my siblings and not to even have to think about anything else. I can't fathom the outrageous medical bills that have already started to pile up in addition to household bills they already have, food, housing, and transportation while away from home for an extended period of time. We do not expect anything from anyone and we are truly appreciative of every donation and prayer we receive. Anything I can do to help my family, I need to try to do. I honestly cannot describe how grateful we are to have everyone's thoughts and prayers focused on our two babies. They deserve to live a full, happy, and healthy life in this world. I ask that if you have negative comments or questions that you please direct them to me personally using the message option next to my name as the campaign creator. This may be just another story to you but this is our life now. #StrebeStrongI'm including the first update that my Dad posted on the night of the accident as well as the first news article that was written:http://www.thesalemnewsonline.com/article_f7842912-9b1f-11e6-abd5-13c649f78830.htmlUpdate from my Dad:John Strebe:  I feel awkward posting. But there are to many people to call. It's just before 4 am. They are still actively doing procedures on Elias Aj Strebe. They have completed procedures for Kirsten Strebe as of this time and they are monitoring her. Both are still in critical condition. Both have major concerns and have traumatic brain injuries. Both are on ventilators. Neither have gained consciousness since the accident. Kirsten had a drain placed into her brain in an attempt to remove blood from the ventricles. Elias just had a main line put into his pelvic artery. They placed a fiber optic pressure measuring device into his brain. He has several areas where there is bleeding on brain. So they could not put a drain in. He has several fractures in the face and fractured pelvis and collapsed lung. They repaired a cut artery in his finger. And believe the blood in his pelvic cavity may be coming from the fracture cutting into artery. He has received blood transfusions and they are trying to keep his blood pressure up. We appreciate all the love and support we have seen so far, it is greatly appreciated. I figured I would send this out to give real information so everyone hears the truth. At this time there are no visitors other than family. The staff advised us. Cards, milar balloons and stuff animals are permitted. No flowers or latex balloons. They do not have room numbers only assigned trauma numbers at this time. They advised that if anything was sent, address it to their names in the PICU. St Louis Children's hospital. Elias and Kirsten are on opposite sides of the PICU. They are not together. We ask that you continue with prayers. I will try to post once daily with real info on their conditions.Read more"

Her mum, Sylinda, has been by her side ever since. This morning her dad, Tim, flew home from work and is now with Hannah. Hannah is a beautiful, bubbly, happy 6 year old little girl. Today she is fighting for her life in an induced coma in ICU an PMH. The doctors are baffled. Hannah has undergone many tests including a CT, which showed swelling on the brain, an EEG, MRI, blood cultures. This morning the medical staff tried to remove the breathing tube but Hannah had a seizure so was re sedated. At the moment the doctors are treating her for numerous infections including meningitis however until the cultures come back, which is generally after 48 hours, they are stumped. This family has so much support from friends and family who are all sending prayers and love. Tim's parents are here in Perth however Sylinda's family are all in Canada. Sylinda and Tim have 3 other children at home and when Hannah wakes up it possible that she will have a long road ahead of rehab. This loving, generous, beautiful family need our help. I would love to be able to raise enough funds so that Sylinda can have her mum here with her and also relieve the financial pressure from this family while they focus on getting their happy, bubbly, beautiful little Hannah back to good health. Any money raised will be going straight to Sylinda and Tim. I ask you all to please dig deep for this family and share this page as much as possible.

Through his truly remarkable heroism, Craig saved his own life that day. After being struck and pinned between two cars, Craig had the wherewithal to instruct his roommate and neighbor to lay him on the ground and create tourniquets out of their belts until paramedics arrived. Doctors later said that this act of bravery and heroism saved his life. Craig serves as an inspiration to those of us who know him and those who will read his story. However, for his friends and family his inspiration did not begin with this tragic moment. At only 28-years-old, Craig had found his passion – fitness, endurance sports, and helping others achieve their fitness goals. Craig lives a healthy lifestyle; he doesn’t drink alcohol, eat sugar and often works out twice a day. He even joined BBSC Endurance Sports and Your Cause Sports because he wanted to work with a company that caters to others. He truly dedicates his personal and professional life to the betterment of others and the community. On July 4th, while many of us were out celebrating, Craig was returning from such an event; the Star Spangled Splash 5K & 10K, where he timed his first race by himself. He was so happy to have done such a good job in his new position. It’s rare for us to find a passion and then make that passion our life’s work – but Craig did it. He provides tangible proof that we can make a positive life change if we so choose. We have no doubt that Craig will pull through this tragedy and that he will once again inspire us, but it will be a long road to recovery. In order to help Craig, we have setup a Go Fund Me page on his behalf. It is time to give back to the most selfless individual that we know. We are asking for your help to support Craig and his family with the financial burden of this tragedy. Prosthetic legs, medical bills, insurance expenses, physical and emotional rehab, home and vehicle modifications, all add up and his mother will not be able to do it alone. Please help by sharing this story with others and/or donating to his cause so that he may return to the lifestyle that he deserves.

He was unable to get up and fell 4 more times, suffering serious injuries. Shaking, sweating and in obviousshock, unwilling to put weight on his left hind leg, he was being attended to by an emergency vet within an hour of the accident. X-rays were non-determinative, yet he was non-weight bearing on his left hind. We weresentimmediately toTufts Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. Tufts decided to do abone scan but theradioactive isotopes could not be gotten until that Monday. On Monday, he was sedated and underwenta bone scan and ultrasound. He was found to have a non-displaced fracture of his left femur and abadly torn adductor muscle. These injuries made it impossible for him to get up from laying down because he was using 3 legs,so the vets decided he had to stand 24 hours a day on crossties. This horse has such strength of character, grace,and such trust in people, that he tolerated this unnatural restriction of hismovement, despite being a young energeticstallion. After two weeks he was challenged to see if he could get up from laying down. He did, but with great difficulty, so he was returned to the crossties for another week. After thatweek, thevetschallenged him again,this time he got up, so afteranother few days, he was discharged to my vet's rehab facility in Rhode Island.Within three days of being at the rehab, he was found down again andunable to rise. He had been struggling for some time to get to his feet. Butthis time he suffered additional injuries, the mostobvious being amassive bleed/swelling in his left adductor group. We raced him back toTufts and an ultrasound showed that he now had torn another muscle -- the gracillus muscle, but moresignificantly, he hadinjured the ligament holdingthe femur in the joint which was potentiallylife-threatening. But this, we thought, was the fullthe extent of hisproblems, serious as they were, the vets were still optimistic. Subsequently, Tufts recommended aconservative approach, restricting all movement, crossties 24 hours a day. Quiebro spent from April 27th until the present on crossties, all day,all night, goingfor one short walk up the hall each morning. But he seemed to be doing well, putting up with this restriction with his usual grace and kindness, always interested in the goings-on in the ward and welcoming all the attention that the students and techs were happy to give him. His affinity for people and huge personality was apeople magnet. I was told he had a fan club and when he went for his walks, the whole pharmacy would flock to the window to tell him how beautiful he was. He is the darling of thewhole hospital,admired for his beauty andhis engagingcharacter. I thought we were out of the woods, with another ultrasound scheduled for next week, but was stunned to receive a phone call from Dr. Jeneiin the middle of the night on May 23 telling me that he'd had a seizure.They wanted permission to anesthesize for a spinal tap, and then get him on his feet with the sling and hoist. He then would have to remain in the sling.The thought/hope was it may be EPM, and that possibly the very first fall was from a EPM related seizure that wasn't recognized at the time.A spinal tap was done and we are now waiting for the labs to come back; meanwhile EPM treatment has been started. Last night, May 25th this beautiful boy suffered another seizure and this does not bode well.The best scenario would be EPM, but seizures are serious in an animal this size and it isn't safe for him to be moved.To date his hospital bills are closing in on $13,000.Prior to the seizures, he'd been put on ""layup"" board of $70.00 a day plus lab fees. Now, as of May 23, his daily costs have jumped to between $300 and $400 a day. Because he cannot be moved or discharged, I am terrifyingly between a rock and a hard place and with expenses like this, as a retiree, I cannot sustain more than another week.Seizures are very serious in a horse but I cannot comprehend not being able to give him a little more time, another chance to be treated and have a chance to live!!! He is such a special horse and a truly precious soul, I am shattered by my situation. I've never been comfortable asking for help -- I have too much pride, but I am simply overwhelmed with this horrific turn of events.But Im am compelledto seek help for Quiebro, for this beautiful boy who doesn't deserve to have his life cut short.He is now beginning his third month of hospitalization and I fear thatmoney will dictate my next move, whether I can give him a chance or have to put him down.He is only 7 years old and until March 31st his life was filled with promise. Heis a once-in-a-lifetime horse and blessing.I hope you can find it in your heart to help me give him a few weeks to try treatment and possibly save his life.I cannot bring myself to think of his life cut short, nor can I imagine not giving him a fair and fighting chance. I know the vets at Tufts feel the same way as they are all invested in him and he has won hearts.Quiebro is the darling of the school, loved for his beauty and affinity for peopleRead more"

The last 90 days have included nearly 60 days on a ventilator with proning, a tracheotomy, a feeding tube, two separate rehab facility stays, and multiple infections including three different types of pneumonia—viral, bacterial, and aspiration. Matt was also recently found to have several tears in his left shoulder most likely from having to be proned. He is getting stronger each day and we hope to have him home very soon but his journey is far from over. Matt will still need extensive therapy to get him back to the stage where his talents are enjoyed by so many.

She was in foster care for the first 17 months of her life, and even though the family she was with cared for and loved her very much, we have always felt it was best she was with family. Hailey was reunified with her mother at 17 months and although she received the support and assistance from the state and many family and friends, Hailey has been neglected and living a very unstable life for the past 10 months - including moving from a rehab home, to an apartment that was voluntarily destroyed along with ALL of Haileys belongings, and now currently living in a homeless shelter. We want what is best for Hailey, we always have, but unfortunately the system is failing her and not doing right by our girl. She has been bounced around from place to place in the last 2 years and we have seen alarming and drastic changes in her behavior and believe she would thrive in a more stable environment with people she knows and loves. We have also seen the neglect first hand in the last 10 months and are terrified how much more will happen if something isn’t done. We are also hoping this gives her mother the opportunity to get the help she needs so she can be the mother Hailey needs.Unfortunately, in the last month there have been multiple reports of neglect and we are now watching the department of social services put Hailey’s needs last and not do what is in the best interest of my niece and she is back in foster care. They have dismissed multiple allegations that we have seen with our own eyes in order to reunify her again. It was recommended by the judge in last month’s hearing that my mother file for custody because she saw things that were very alarming. This week we found out that Hailey was placed back in foster care and were not notified. We are absolutely devastated again because our family has the ability to provide a loving and stable environment.For the last 2 years Hailey has had regular weekend visits twice a month with her paternal grandmother and the two share a strong bond. While visiting my mother, she got to see all of her biological cousins, aunts, and uncles on her fathers side. Sherri (my mother) has consistently provided a loving and stable environment and we believe Hailey would thrive under My mother’s care.My mother has hired a lawyer to fight on behalf of Hailey, the way she deserves to be fought for. We need legal representation in order to be heard by the courts since they are trying to send Hailey back with her mother again. We have started a go fund me to ask our friends and community to step up and help us bring Hailey home. In order to go to battle for Hailey’s well being, we need funds - more than we could have anticipated. We are asking for donations to help with the cost of a lawyer, court fees, and the paperwork to file custody of Hailey. Our biggest hope and prayer is that Hailey would be safe, feel loved, and have the opportunities that she deserves. We appreciate anything you can possibly do to help us help her.#BringHaileyHome Read more"

At about 9:00 PM that evening, just minutes after he filled up his car with gas - his life changed forever in a terrible car accident that left him seriously injured with a collapsed lung, several broken ribs and fractured femur, and a spinal cord injury resulting in no feeling or movement below his hips. On August 10th (the day after his accident), Eli was scheduled to start a new job in sales with B&R Auto Wrecking - a job he hopes to return to following his recovery and return to independence. Many thanks to the B&R Auto Wrecking team for their care and support during this difficult time.In the days following his accident, Eli received treatment in the ICU at Albany General Hospital and at Good Samaritan Hospital in Corvallis, Oregon. On August 21st, Eli and family travelled by Air Medical Transport to the Craig Hospital in Englewood, Colorado (just outside of Denver) - https://craighospital.org/ . The Craig Hospital specializes in treating patients with spinal cord and traumatic brain injuries. In-patient Rehab therapy/treatment for Eli’s Spinal Cord Injury - currently classified as a T-10 A (Complete) injury - began on August 24th and is expected to continue until his discharge in mid-October 2020, when he will either continue his rehab as an outpatient at Craig Hospital or will return to Oregon for outpatient rehab services at a location closer to his family’s home in Albany, Oregon. Eli (20) was a varsity football player and multi-sport athlete at West Albany High School, and remained active and physically fit following his 2019 graduation. Eli is now faced with an unknown set of lifechanging impacts from a devastating injury. As a testament to his strength of character and resolve, he remains in remarkably good spirits and is determined/motivated to get stronger, learn new skills, and improve in any way he can. He feels very lucky to be alive and knows that his injury (as severe as it is) could have been much worse.The extent of Eli’s possible long-term recovery from his spinal cord injury is currently unknown and will best be measured in months or years (as opposed to days and weeks). Only time, and the extent to which his body heals will reveal those answers. That said, Eli’s doctors and rehab team have conveyed their strong belief that, even if Eli experiences no return of feeling or movement below his hips, he will be a fully independent person and will be able to drive, work, and live independently (albeit in a wheelchair).To help on his journey toward recovery and independence, Eli will need continued outpatient therapy, medications, medical supplies, and adaptive/medical equipment (beyond what medical insurance will cover). Eli’s parents will need to modify their home with ramps, widened doorways, remodeled bathroom(s), other kitchen/exterior fixes, etc. to ensure his safe and independent living at home. He will also need to purchase and have a vehicle modified (hand operated controls, other modifications) so that he can drive safely and independently to and from work. He will need many things over time... including your love, care and support!If you feel moved to help make a difference in Eli McSpaden’s life at this crucial time, we’d be forever grateful for any financial support you can provide to him.Read more"

She left home to help a friend and never returned. Someone made an illegal left turn in front of her that changed her life in the blink of an eye. Ebony was T-Boned. Ebony suffered multiple injuries that include head trauma (loss of consciousness, altered cognition, sutures, head dent, rehab), spine fracture (PARS L4, L5), and broken ankle/toes. Ouch! She was initially hospitalized at Miami Valley Hospital for a week and is now going through inpatient rehab at The Rehab Institute of Ohio. Once she is discharged from rehab, she will need more outpatient rehab and home healthcare. She speaks fondly of of her caretakers and is receiving great care. She is making great progress and her father comes to see her every day. Ebony is my coworker. We are nurses. I am always grateful when we work together. She's a hard worker and we never have to worry about the medication room when she's with us. We are both fairly new in our positions. She was a week shy of her one year probationary period when the accident happened. October 27th would have been her 1 year anniversary at our job. She has already used up all of her sick and vacation time due to the accident. The other driver was sited at the accident where Ebony was knocked unconscious. The other driver, who was at fault, was uninsured. Ebony carries her own health insurance through work and her car was insured. Some of her medical expenses will be out of pocket because health insurance does not cover everything. She will need a wheelchair, walker, shower chair and other assistive equipment. The main purpose of this fundraiser is to help with Ebony's loss of income.  Ebony has worked hard for everything she has. This wonderful human being has been an LPN, caring for others for 14 yrs. Ebony has taken care of those with special needs in group home settings. She has taken care of children, both inpatient and outpatient. She's wonderful with the elderly from her experience in long term care settings. More recently her focus has been mental health, outpatient and now inpatient with us! Ebony has even completed her schooling to become an RN. She just needs to take her boards. My personal opinion is she should be an RN already. She's smart, hard-working and intuitive. Ebony is fiercely independent. Typically she doesn't need anything from anyone. She does not like feeling like a burden on others, but extends her own helping hand with no problem. She would never ask for help even if she is at the end of her rope. That's why I'm stepping in. Sometimes life throws it's strongest participants a curveball. This unfortunate event is a setback for Ebony because she will be out of work for awhile (length unknown), which means no income. She has already used up her sick leave that she accumulated due to this accident. Please help our friend. She will appreciate it even though she would never ask for it. Her coworkers want her to be back at work. Ebony wants to be back at work too!Read more"

I never had any symptoms serious or otherwise indicating brain cancer.The first symptoms present itself in September 2020.I began to lose control on my right hand fingers. I was not able to grip even the smallest item.The symptoms escalated in 3 weeks, I was slowly losing control of my right arm, I have difficulties moving the whole right arm, I had to only rely on using my left arm while getting alternative treatment (chiropractor and acupuncture)None of the treatments were working then about 2 weeks later I lost most control on the right arm, was not able to move it let alone using them for day to day activity.I started looking for more information and consulting to medical team. I was lucky enough to find a neurologist and was sent for some tests in the hospital.The result of the test came out and I was advised that there was absolutely nothing wrong with my arm,The neurologist said this is something more than just claw hand.My work was kind enough to allow me to keep working to help with my daily expenses even I was not able to perform to my best ability.I was then sent to get an MRI test done and informed by the neurologist that this could be a serious case.24 hours later I was contacted by the doctor and he said that they have found out that I have Brain tumour growing on my left brain sizing 5 cm when the max is 6 cm. And I was diagnosed with stage 3 brain tumour.In the mean time, I started to also lose control on my right leg, it became paralysed, the tumour has also effected my speech,I have to speak very slowly and pronunciation became a challenge.I underwent surgery on 23 December 2020 as advised by the doctor.The surgery lasted for 7 hours.I rested for 2 weeks in Macquarie Hospital. My recovery was good, but I was advised by the doctor, they were not able to remove all the tumour and there is still a long road to recovery or feeling 100%.I was discharged from hospital and moved to Royal Rehab Centre 2 weeks ago,Unfortunately, after the operation, I still dont have control of my right hand and leg. My speech is slightly better, I am not able to speak fluently but I am responding fine. Doctor highly recommended that i stay in Australia to finish the treatment (Physiotherapy, Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy) due to limitation in my home country and travel issue in Covid situation.In January 2021 I received medical bills from Macquarie Hospital for the operation totalling $23,000.I do hold Overseas Student Health Cover, but unfortunately the health cover does not cover all medical bills,My Mother managed to come to Australia on Emergency granted visa and managed to scrape together some monies to cover some of my medical cost. My Mother had used all the money that she brought with her to make payments for radiotherapy and chemoterapy treatments as she did not know that we would be receiving such large amount of hospital invoice for the operation.

Greyson's delivery into this world was traumatic.  His diagnosis was hypoxic ischemic encophalopathy (lack of oxygen to the brain) and he was put on cooling therapy to try to minimize any damage that may have occurred.  Fast forward to two years later, and Greyson was given the diagnosis of spastic diplegia cerebral palsy.  Now at age 3, the spasticity (tone or tightness) in his legs continues to prevent Greyson from walking with ease.  As his bones have grown, his muscles can't keep up and his legs have gotten tighter and tighter.  Despite the multiple therapies and at home stretching, doctors felt that it was time to take action.  Greyson will be having a procedure in January 2018 called Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy in which a small incision is made in the back to allow access to the spinal chord where the neurosurgeon can find which nerves are triggering the tightness in his legs and to cut them.  Greysons team of doctors (including his Neurologist, Neurosurgeon, Physical Medicine Doctor, Orthopedic Doctor and Physical Therapist) feel Greyson is a great candidate for this surgery given he used to walk independently and functions very highly for someone with his disability.  After this surgery, there is about 3 weeks of inpatient rehab to re-teach Greyson how to use his legs without all the muscle tone.  It will take time for him to recover and build strength. Greysons loving parents tony and krystle -“As parents, we want nothing more than our child to have every opportunity to live a 'normal' life.  Although scary, we are very hopeful that this procedure is the right step we needed to take for Greyson.  His resilience, determination, strength and courage continues to amaze us each day.  We are so HOPEFUL that one day soon he will be able to walk again.  We appreciate all of your care, concern, thoughts, prayers, and help along the way!

We believe Jen was thrown and landed face first. The force of the landing pushed her neck backwards and caused an injury to her spinal cord. Initially, she could not move her extremities.Jen was airlifted to North Memorial in Robbinsdale from Sand Dunes State Park, in Big Lake, MN. After a CT scan and an MRI, it was determined that she had pressure on her spinal cord but did not have any fractures. A surgical procedure was done on Sunday evening to reduce the pressure on her spinal cord. Post-surgery, she has since been recovering in the ICU and has stabilized. She has gained very limited movement to her arms and less to her legs.Next steps will involve care in an intensive rehab facility followed by long-term care. It is currently unknown the length of time she will need extensive care.Rick has also discovered that Jen's medical insurance coverage has lapsed, and she is currently uninsured.

Dave is battling a massive, life-threatening, partially malignant, astrocytoma brain tumor.Over two neurosurgeries last December and this January, 80% of the tumor was removed. The surgeries were followed by 6 weeks of combined proton therapy and chemo treatments. Dave will continue with monthly chemo and MRIs every other month for a year and then regular MRIs for years afterwards.The tumor is the big, gray mass on the left.I’m reaching out to ask for your help. Please consider a donation of any size to help Dave cover basic living expenses and his portion of current and future medical costs. Your donation will go to The David Carlson Special Needs Trust that was created specifically for Dave’s medical care.Dave is studying to be a neurologist or a neuropsychiatrist at the UC San Diego School of Medicine. He’s halfway through his 3rd of 4 years of med school. Last Thanksgiving Dave told us he’d scheduled an eye exam because of his recurring headaches and vision problems. The exam showed swollen optic nerves. Dave was sent directly to the Emergency Department.Everything changed for Dave and our family when an MRI revealed the huge tumor. Deep and dangerously close to Dave’s brainstem, it had shifted the midline of his brain, infiltrated critical areas and damaged others. Immediately, Dave was hospitalized for surgery.The surgical risks included incapacitating brain damage, paralysis, and complete vision loss. Fortunately, most of the tumor was safely removed. However, Dave has some permanent visual field loss. He can’t drive and may never be able to again.Dave after surgery and later at the Proton Radiation CenterThe good news and what makes us so very hopeful is that a recent MRI shows tumor shrinkage – very unusual, especially this early in treatment. There are ongoing medical advances too. Dave has a recently identified genetic marker that indicates a better prognosis. All this, along with his impressive progress and his resilience has us very encouraged that Dave can beat this.Dave with friends shortly after his first surgeryWhile Dave focuses his energies on getting better and on his studies,(Yes! he is already back in med school with a modified schedule), I've stepped in and created this campaign to help bring Dave some relief from the financial pressures he's facing from his two surgeries; proton radiation; chemo for a year; co-pays for meds, including those to prevent seizures; medical insurance premiums; a hospital sponsored driving rehab program if Dave’s vision improves enough to make him eligible; and study aids.If anyone can beat this and use his experience to help others, it’s Dave! As a proud little sister, I must say his list of accomplishments is long: starting a business, designing and teaching a unique MCAT curriculum to help others realize their dream of becoming a doctor, co-authoring scientific research papers for peer reviewed journals, leading a Congressional District voter registration team in the 2008 election and attending a National Convention as an elected delegate, to name just a few! Dave’s also a gifted artist and a great guitarist.Dave with Mom ringing the bell after completing his proton treatmentI’ve heard Dave say, more than once,“I want to get better, I want to be a doctor, andI want to be an inspiration to people and help them.”Please help give Dave a second chance in life so he can pursue his dream and continue to serve. Your kindness and generosity will contribute to the success of an empathetic, compassionate, wise doctor who knows firsthand what it’s like to be a patient needing life-saving treatment.Those of you who know my brother know he’s a big boxing fan who draws inspiration from pro boxers who persist in spite of the odds. This quote from Rocky V is one of his favorites – and in my opinion so perfectly sums up Dave’s philosophy and how he leads his life,“Going in for one more round when you don’t think you can. That’s what makes all the difference in life.”Thank you in advance for helping Dave continue to make a difference. Please share his story with others who may be moved to help.A selfie of our family I took on Mother's DayOn behalf of Dave and our family, I thank you from my heart.- VanessaRead more"

This 8 1/2 year old boxer was quickly introduced to a new potential owner who wanted him immediately. We were told by Rocky's former owner that Rocky had no health issues. We were told that he simply didn't want the dog anymore bc he was moving. We were told that Rocky was okay. During his meet and greet with Rocky's new potential home, he started bleeding profusely from his mouth.He was rushed into the emergency animals hospital that night only to discover a mouth tumor which had abcessed. A closer look revealed rotting teeth. The emergency vet explained Rocky's situation to us clearly: He needs a biopsy of this mouth tumor, immediatly. Our goal is to get Rocky adopted and in order to do so, we must get him on the road to good health. Years of neglect CAN often be undone but it will take a few months. We are currently striking deals with THREE different vet clinics in order to sort out Rocky's procedures. We know he needs a full, under the gumline dental scaling AND have several teeth pulled. We know his tumor needs to be removed and biopsied. We also now realize that he has a very bad knee which needs tending to. We need imaging done by an orthopedist (which we think we have secured at a discount) to determine if he can avoid surgery for this and do a course of rehab instead. A blood panel will need to be done in order to proceed with the tumor removal and to determine if there is anything cancerous going on in his body already (we do realize that this is possible). Please help us get this guy the start he deserves. For someone to neglect this well-behaved, people loving, kid loving, dog loving dog this way only to dump him like rubbish in the end is not alright. This do is so easily homeable with just a bit of healthcare. These procedures must be done immediately. WHO WE ARE:We are Kirstin and Thea and we are both professional animal trainers living in Los Angeles who care for animals full-time, year round. We are giving our own funds and time to this. 100% of these funds will go directly to the veterinary clinics.

She had just turned 24 in September of that year.  Little did anyone realize what was to come just a little over one year later. Stephanie went in for an MRI at 1:30 p.m. on October 29, 2018. Just 8 hours later, she was at the University of Vanderbilt Hospital in the neuro ICU.  The MRI showed that she had mass pushing on her brain stem. It was life threatening, and they were told she would have died within two weeks time. The mass is called a menegioma. Some cases of menegioma tumors never even produce symptoms. But in Stephanie’s case, the menegioma would be fatal without surgery. Stephanie hadn’t felt well for several months, but there was always an answer for why she felt bad. Stephanie’s mom and dad came in for a visit in October, and her dad noticed something was not right. Stephanie’s balance was off and her speech wasn’t quite right. How could we not have seen it? The MRI was scheduled a few days later and our world was changed forever. Stephanie’s surgery to remove the mass was scheduled for November 5th. The medical team was put together plus the OR was reserved for 12 hours. She went to surgery around 6:30 a.m.  The updates were nothing but good all day long. We were so happy. The surgery was stopped around 7:30 p.m. that evening. Stephanie’s brain was tired of the operation and the medical team had to stop. They had removed 50% of the menegioma.  Theyhad hoped to remove 80% of the mass and use radiation on the remaining 20%. A second surgery would come soon. A second surgery was scheduled for November 12th. Stephanie was taken to surgery around 7 a.m. that morning. The surgery would not happen this day. Stephanie’s lungs didn’t sound good, and a bacterial infection had developed. We learned she had developed pneumonia and had a blood clot in her arm and possibly her lung as well. One week later, she would develop meningitis. And, she now had c diff. It was just one thing after another. We had no idea what would happen at this point. Fast forward to December 18th. Stephanie has recovered from all of the above issues. She would be moved to a long term care facility. She has a trach and is on a vent. While at Vanderbilt, they also shaved her head to place a shunt. Her body has weakened, she has lost 35 pounds, and unable to do very little. She is also very depressed.  If she can be weaned off the vent, she can be moved to a rehab facility. She will need intense physical therapy to re-learn body functions. And, there is still an impending second surgery. Stephanie’s parents and her husband have been by her side continuously. They have lived out of hotel rooms and running on little sleep and rest with continuous worry. Stephanie’s medical bills will be astronomical as she was flown by medflight to Nashville from Sevierville, been in neuro ICU for 50 days, and now in long term care for 11 days and counting. The next step will be moving to a rehab facility.  Further, she still faces that 2nd surgery. And, the cycle will start again. Hopefully, with much fewer problems after the next surgery.Any monies raised will will go to Stephanie’s medical bills that have been incurred so far along with bills that will surely be coming in the next months. We appeal to you to contribute to help with Stephanie’s expenses. If you are unable to contribute, we still ask for your prayers. And, if you don’t mind, please share this post. We appreciate any help for this sweet, beautiful young lady. Thank you & God bless. Read more"

I wanted to share Christian’s story so we can raise much needed funds to support him through his recovery.In the early hours of Boxing day morning 2020, Christian fell down the stairs at his home he shares with his wife Victoria. He was rushed to hospital where it was confirmed he had a dislocation of the C7 and fracture of the T1 vertebrae. This caused the vertebrae to put pressure on the spinal cord. Christian was in intensive care at Brighton Hospital for 2 weeks and underwent vital surgery before moving to a ward and then eventually to Stanmore Rehab Center on the 22nd January where he remains. Christian is unable to move his legs and will continue to stay at Stanmore through his intensive recovery plan. Once he is able to leave hospital and go home to his parents house where he will move with his wife (they’re own home is not big enough for wheelchair access) he will need continued physiotherapy and other treatments to give him the best chance of using his legs again. The first 2 years are important as its when the most progress can be made. Christian has endured the last 9 weeks under exceptional circumstances. He has been unable to have his family by his side and has had to deal with so much of these life changes alone. It has been heartbreaking for the family who so wish to see him and give him the physical and emotional support he needs face to face. Christian, is the most wonderful person.

He was rushed directly into surgery upon being brought to the trauma center of John Muir Hospital in nearby Walnut Creek.
Tim had sustained severe head trauma when he fell, and doctors needed to act quickly to reduce the swelling and bleeding in his brain, removing a piece of his skull in the process. He spent the next 3 weeks in the ICU on life support, with a breathing machine, constant IV fluids, and intubated feeding while his doctors worked to keep him alive and bring him back to consciousness.Mom (Debbie) and Dad (Frank) flew out to be with him immediately, who were quickly followed by brothers Andy, Jeff, and Jonathan, and girlfriend Natalie. Tim has been moved several times since to Kentfield Hospital for rehabilitative care and treatment, and back to John Muir, where surgeons have replaced the piece of his skull that was removed. He is now in Acute Rehab at John Muir.It has been a difficult road for Tim. With the damage he received to his brain in the fall, he awoke with only limited control of the muscles in his left side, and no ability to move his right side at all. Communication is a significant challenge as his speech center in the temporal lobe was damaged, but doctors believe that he can regain some of this in time, with daily therapy to redevelop and train the neural pathways from his brain to the rest of his body.He has seen great progress and wonderful care under the watchful eye of his doctors and therapists, and has even begun to regain his comprehension and the use of his right arm and leg! Mom and Dad have never left his side during this time, taking time away from home and work to protect one of the most valuable things in their lives; Dad even having to resign from his job to be there for Tim.While his doctors and family work to provide the very best care for Tim, the road ahead will be very long, and very difficult...To date, the costs for John Muir are an upwards of $2,162,000, not including the $35,000 bill from Kentfield - much of this will be covered by insurance, but not all, and Mom and Dad's temporary relocation/living expenses in California for the last few months have been a factor. We do not have an estimate for the anticipated expenses of Tim's ongoing care but his co-pays and deductibles will exceed $10,000, and he is in need of handicap accessible items(ie. wheelchair), adaptive equipment, and home modifications that are not covered by insurance.Tim will be leaving CA (sometime in December) to continue therapy in Boston, which will continue for months. With no ability to work, he will have no income, depending on support from family for ongoing expenses, including increased health insurance costs and everyday living expenses, as he continues on his long road to recovery.We now need your help to get through this difficult time. His progress is encouraging, but he will have a great deal of work to do before he can get back to the Tim Butterworth that everyone knows and loves. Still a talented musician and performer, we know that he will still be able to bring people smiles, but he will need your help to get there. Please help us to help Tim bring music to the world again!

He has made his mark on radio and television, in the movies and in print, working successively as a recording artist (as a founding member of Def Jam's Original Concept), hip-hop DJ (he was the Beastie Boys's DJ during the Raising Hell Tour in 1986) , composer, talent scout, on-air personality, actor, author, and critic. He's undoubtedly best-known as the co-host with Ed Lover of ""Yo! MTV Raps"" (1[phone redacted]), the tv show that did more than any other to make rap music and hip-hop culture global phenomena. After ""Yo!"", Dre and Ed duo funneled their chemistry into major market radio. They held down the morning show on New York's Hot 97 (1[phone redacted]), then on L.A.'s The Beat (2[phone redacted]), and finally on New York's Power 105 (2[phone redacted]).What's less well known is that Dre has been struggling with the effects of advanced Type II diabetes for a long time. Dre's announcement that the illness had robbed him of his eyesight was one of the ways he's gone on to ""wag[e] a public battle with diabetes"" -- as a story in the New York Times described his efforts in 2016. Now, sadly, Dre's condition has taken a turn for the worse. On Memorial Day of this year, he slipped and fell down a flight of stairs at his home and badly damaged his right ankle. The diabetes had already caused a serious decline in the function of that ankle, but this new injury required hospitalization and surgery. On June 17, his foot was amputated. On June 24, his right leg was amputated up to the knee. He has since been fitted with a prosthetic, and is now learning how to walk with it. If the good Doctor remains true to his unsinkable form, he may someday be running marathons using that prosthetic.In the meanwhile, Dre needs to continue recovering. He left the hospital on July 1 and has been living at a rehab center since then. Just where he and his wife end up afterwards is still being decided. Their current house doesn't accommodate someone with Dre's health issues. They plan to buy a new house that works for Dre today, one with all the facilities on one floor, no stairs, ramps for a wheelchair, and wide-access doors. Given all of Dre's high-profile achievements, you might imagine that he had all the money he needs to pay for his care, but diabetes cut short his career nearly 15 years ago. Likewise, it's been a full ten years since he lost his eyesight. Dre's insurance stopped paying for his stay in the rehab center on July 20. When he leaves the rehab center for home, he'll require both a physical therapist and an occupational therapist, neither of whose fees will be fully covered by insurance.Bottom line: the great man needs help to move on to the next stage of his life. Please help us help him.

Scott was feeling a little stronger, so they decided to go bite the bullet and go on their dream vacation to Hawaii at the beginning of 2020, before the COVID hit. Throughout 2020, Scott started feeling ill again and his doctors began chemotherapy. Needless to say, it was a rollercoaster ride for Scott. Some days were better than others. Throughout this time Scott did not waiver in his duties to his job and family. He told Tracy that it kept his mind off of what he was dealing with and helped them financially.

Vincent has been fighting for his life for the past 6 weeks now at the Cleveland Clinic after he suffered a cardiac arrest on January 18, 2021. We have three beautiful girls ages 8, 5 and 3. Vincent is a loving, funny and very hardworking husband and father. He is a Christian and an avid preacher who loves to share the word of God. He shared the word of God with the African Christian Fellowship (ACF), Cleveland Chapter 48 hours prior to his incident. He is a good man that loves and cares for his family and everyone who meets him. He is fighting a hard battle to get back home to all of us. With that comes mounting bills which we are asking for your help with as well as funds to keep our home running.On the fateful morning, I heard Vincent snoring uncharacteristically loud as I was getting ready for school and when I received no response after I called him, I ran to find him foaming in his mouth. I made my first 911 call and within an hour, he was hooked up to a ventilator, life support and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) but hopes of survival as the doctors put it, were slim and he was transferred to the Cleveland Clinic main campus for further interventions. In the first week, he had an axillary impella placed to help his heart pump, multiple organ failures including his kidneys and needed dialysis daily, two code blues and literally only alive with the help of machines and I was told to prepare for the worst. We prayed and believed God for a miracle.He developed side effects I never knew could exist from all the interventions being done to help him live but he has made a miraculous turn around in the ensuing couple of weeks despite not having any neurological activity detected and the team expecting him not to have full brain functions even if he wakes up. There have been setbacks, but he is still here and improving every day.He is out of CICU after a month and in a step-down unit, off ventilator and breathing on his own, eating pureed foods and making conversation. He will be going to an acute rehab facility to learn how to walk again and other basic functions as he continues recovery. Bills from the processes have started coming in and the anticipated conservative estimate for all his treatments is approximately US $1.5 million. His insurance will cover a small fraction and as such a lot of help is needed.Our story is actually longer than we can tell but we are telling some of it with the hope that we can get help from everyone in any capacity to help settle the already incurred bills from ICU stay, those to come from acute rehab after he is discharged. We are grateful for your continued prayers. We also ask for your financial support at this time as he is still on the road to recovery to coming back home. I am a student at Cleveland State University currently pursuing a graduate degree in Clinical Chemistry.We are humbly counting on your support and deeply appreciate it.

On August 10th 2020, my cousin Kevin and his 2 boys, Bastian & Riordan, were involved in a horrific auto accident.  The result of this accident has left Kevin with a broken nose that requires surgery to repair and a gash to his head that required staples. Bastian, by the Grace of God, escaped with only minor injuries as determined by a CT scan and an examination in the pediatric ER. Riordan, however, was unconscious at the scene and rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery.  He is currently fighting for recovery in the pediatric ICU unit.

Riordan suffered from a very severe skull fracture that left him unconscious after the accident.  While some areas of his recovery have been very promising, the doctors have become very concerned with the muscles in his mouth and throat.  He is unable to utilize those muscles and had to be placed on a feeding tube. The extent of his injuries have also caused some concern with his cognitive function.  At this point in time, the doctors do not have definitive answers on what his recovery may look like or what obstacles Riordan may face. He will eventually be transferred to an inpatient rehab facility where he will receive around the clock care from physical and occupational therapy specialists.

Kevin and his wife Val are incredible parents and I love them so much and it just breaks my heart to see them watch their son fighting for the life he once enjoyed.  I know from a past medical experience that I had with my own son, that they need as much support as they can get right now. 

There are so many obstacles they will be facing, not only emotionally, but financially.  
I cannot take away the emotional pain they are feeling, but I am hoping with this donation page I can at least relieve them of some of the financial burdens they will be facing.

Please add the Cavooris family to your prayers and please share this page with as many people as you can.  Any donation that you can make will be life changing.  I want to make sure that money will never be the reason Riordan is unable to receive the medical attention that he needs.

Hello Amazing Humans,Thank you all for your overwhelming generosity! I am filled with gratitude and awe regarding the support I have received. I have never known such profound care and the power of community is evident in my life now more than ever. I’ve always known that humans deeply need other humans and I am touched by how everyone has shown up for me with love and altruism! I am truly blessed. Some of you have reached out independently asking for an alternative way to make a donation, please feel free to connect with me if that is more comfortable for you.I have learned much more about my situation. I have been diagnosed with a grade IV glioblastoma inside my spinal cord. It is an extremely rare and aggressive form of cancer. There have only been approximately 200 reported cases in the world. This means that treatment is complicated.I had a positive experience in my rehab facility, making mobility gains. However, I experienced rapid spinal cord swelling associated with the regrowth of cancer cells. This caused more lower body symptoms. Thanks to a quick moving medical team and dear friends who connected me with an amazing MD I was transferred to Brigham and Women’s/Dana Farber. Within less than 24 hours of my transfer I have had two rounds of radiation and started chemo. They have established an initial treatment plan while they learn more about my specific cancer. Prognosis is unclear at this point but the longevity of my life will not be what I expected and my son will have adversity to overcome.I will need to remain in Boston for treatment for 6 weeks. The rarity of the cancer means that I require care at a research based hospital with those in the top of the field. Hopefully, my insurance company cooperates with this plan. If not I WILL fight them! Many of you know me as a fierce advocate and I am going to do everything in my power to make sure I have the care that I need.I am continuing to accept donations to support medical expenses, a temporary place to stay in Boston when I discharge from inpatient care, medical equipment/care I will need when I return home and ongoing care for my child. I have been wildly independent for most of my adulthood and have taken pride in caring for myself. I am learning now that it’s okay to take care from others.I have experienced fear and sadness but my spirit remains strong, resilient and hopeful. I am blessed to have the care I am receiving. I continue to approach this situation as a part of my journey and know in my heart it will lead to something beautiful. I have welcomed the treatment into my body and told the cancer it is time to go. I am adapting myself and developing a healing mindset. I am resilient! I welcome your healing thoughts and prayers. My connection to all of you gives me the power and fuel to heal my body.I want more time!! I want to make sure I have the opportunity to pour love and joy into my son and into my life’s work helping others. I NEED more time. I have much more to give and share to make sure young people have the opportunity to overcome their adversities and find their light and potential. I am not done in this world!!

Megan was not discovered until nearly 24 hours later. The stroke left her with extensive brain damage, and Megan could no longer speak, swallow, and was completely paralyzed on the right side of her body. Following the stroke, Megan spent 10 days in the ICU, followed by another 2 months in the hospital’s acute care medical rehab unit where she began the very long journey of relearning how to swallow, stand, walk and talk with her new body. Megan continues to receives daily physical, occupational, and speech therapy, all in effort to restore as much of her normal functional ability as possible. Thanks to her hard work she has regained the ability to walk and has some limited use of her right arm and hand . Most devastatingly, she suffers from Broca’s Aphasia, also known as expressive aphasia. This means that any form of communication, both verbal and written, is extremely difficult for her, as her brain cannot connect the thoughts she wants to express into words. This results in broken, incomplete sentences where she is unable to find the words she wants to say. Despite her poor prognosis, Megan continues to improve and our hope is that she will continue to do so. She has, after all, defied the odds before. When Megan was just 2 years old, she was diagnosed with a very rare and aggressive cancer and given only a 10% chance of survival. To combat her cancer, she received 100 days of in-patient chemo and radiation over the course of a year. She is a cancer survivor, but the treatment left her with extreme damage to her heart, lungs, and back. She continues to receive ongoing medical treatments and medications for these conditions, resulting in ongoing and extensive medical bills. Even with these challenges, Megan has always been extraordinary. She was an accomplished artist, writer and pianist. She performed volunteer work in her community. She graduated top of her class in high school, attended college, and went to medical school. When Megan had her stroke, she was in the last 6 months of her residency program and had been awarded a fellowship. Megan had a bright future, but now she may never work again. She has little disability insurance or savings due to her educational expenses and the meager salary that a resident earns. And her medical and therapy needs and costs are ongoing. That is why we are reaching out to you.Megan dedicated her life to helping others. Everyone who worked with her at the hospital told us what an exceptional doctor she was. To quote one of her doctors, “Megan gave everything she had to help her patients. Now she needs us to care for her”. We know times are hard right now, but anything you can give to help Megan continue fighting would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for any help you can provide.Read more"

Rick was scheduled for a routine procedure, cardiac ablation to correct AFIB, which is usually a simple outpatient procedure. All seemed well post operatively until Cal got the call that he was having complications and not waking up from sedation like he should be. The doctors explained that he was showing symptoms of a stroke and they were doing a CT to determine if this was correct. Hours later, these fears were confirmed and Rick was rushed from St. Joe’s to Grady, Intubated and gearing up for an emergency thrombectomy in order to remove the blood clot from the brain. All the while Cal, Molly, Davis and the rest of their family waited for any news. Due to Covid, no one was able to be by his side at the hospital. The surgery was luckily successful and they were able to remove most of the clot. 48 hours after the ablation and the thrombectomy, Cal got the call that a third surgery was in order. The brain had severe swelling and he needed an emergency crainectomy, removal of a portion of the skull, to relieve pressure. The surgery, thankfully, also went well. A couple weeks after these three surgeries the doctors at Grady performed a tracheotomy, so that the pneumonia that was present in the lungs due to intubation would not get any worse and so Rick would be more comfortable. Rick was in the Grady Stroke ICU for about 3 weeks until he was transferred to Emory LTAC (Long Term Acute Care) for rehab and to work on getting the trache out. Cal was able to see him for about 5 minutes in the parking lot when he was transferred from Grady to Emory LTAC . Things were moving very slowly due to the severity of the stroke and the inability to be with Rick other than FaceTime conversations made his time at Emory seem like a lifetime. One month after Rick entered Emory he was moved to Shepherd Center (9/8) and what a Godsend that has been for him and us all. Cal is there with Rick now, living with him his room, but she cannot come and go from the facility. His kids see him via FaceTime and through the gate of the garden. Cal hoped to stay a couple weeks, then return to work while Rick was recovering, but that plan isn’t happening. They both need her to be there. Rick is able to talk and understand, although very confused at times. He has left side paralysis and may never walk again without assistance. He will have another surgery to repair the crainectomy toward the end of his stay at Shepherd. Cal needs to be with him at Shepherd, she is an integral part of his therapy. His release is scheduled for 10-29 and who knows what the future will hold for the Millers.Cal did not want to do Go Fund me, but after 9 weeks and the financial strain ahead we urged her to do so.

Like the warrior that he is, he endured for 5 days home alone with fevers over 102 and horrific body aches. By March 22nd, he was taken to Mt. Sinai in Astoria by ambulance and admitted immediately.On March 28th, after testing positive for Covid, his condition worsened and he needed to be intubated.On March 30th, they were so fearful for his life, they made the decision to transfer him to Mt. Sinai in Manhattan so he could get the best possible care.Since being in Manhattan, this has been a severe rollercoaster ride as this virus has ravaged its way throughout his body. After being on the ventilator for 16 days, they performed a tracheostomy and that seems to be helping him more with breathing.The lasting effects of this virus are insurmountable. His kidneys have failed and he will now need continuous dialysis treatments.Unfortunately, Joel had a lapse in his insurance, and while we are in the process of obtaining emergency Medicaid to assist with his bills, this will not cover a long term rehab facility where he would have the chance to get the best care possible.Anyone who knows Joel knows that he deserves this fighting chance as he is only 38 and has his whole life ahead of him. He is a wonderful man, and is always the first person to reach out and help anyone in need. However, the tables have turned and HE desperately needs US.Anything you can do to help is greatly appreciated.

I’ve been in EMS for 17 years and got my BSN and have been working as an ER nurse for the last 8 or 9 years. I ultimately chose to take on an agency nursing contract because I felt like there was more I could do to help out and went to New York because they were getting pummeled by this. Unfortunately after a few months I contracted a high viral count of Covid 19 from patients I had been taking care of. Ultimately I ended up with the illness, was hospitalized, intubated, placed on a ventilator for 11 or 12 days, and lived in an Intensive Care Unit for an additional few weeks because I was in congestive heart failure, respiratory failure, septic, and several of my organs had taken a blow in the process. 


I was just thankful to be alive and still am very blessed to have pulled through. 


My parents were put in a position to choose end of life care, or keep on battling while I was comatose. 


Luckily, I ended up getting through that experience alive, which horribly isn’t always the case for a lot of people. 


After being released, due to insurance issues, I wasn’t able to get into a rehab hospital to rebuild my strength, and I was sent home prematurely to make space for some folks that were worse off at that point.


Unfortunately because of a blood clot that formed, and my complete weakness, I collapsed two days after being discharged and broke my left leg/ankle.Ive petitioned workmen’s comp twice but they stand firm saying there’s no way to prove I became ill due to an occupational exposure to the virus. And I’ve been without any income for almost 5 months, and was just reaching out to see if anyone’s got some spare change they wouldn’t mind tossing in my direction to help me with the thousands and thousands of dollars I’m getting slapped with bill wise. 


Any and all efforts to lend a hand to help me get back on my feet, so I can get back to helping you and yours, is honestly and very much appreciated. 


Thank you all so much again,-Shawn

Hey folks. I need your help. Not for me but for my friend and neighbor Zeltee Freer. Zeltee fought through Covid 19 and spent over a month between the hospital and rehab recently. We get him “home” just in time for the great blizzard here in Texas. We helped get him through that by asking him to stay at my house during those cold nights. You see Zeltee lives in a travel trailer that was probably built in the early ‘80s. The power has been messed up since it was donated to him about 5 years ago. With the freeze the water pipes busted so now there is no water. It has a roof leak that drips on his bed when the wind blows the rain under the metal roof we got build over the trailer. The other night I about lost it. He came to the house to let me know on of the outlets was sparking and trying to catch on fire with one of his radiator type heaters plugged in. Next month Zeltee turns 83 years young. I would really like to get him a new to him travel trailer. I know beggars shouldn’t be choosy but I would like him to get one with enough room for a person to permanently live in. It doesn’t matter if the A/C works or even the heater as far as that goes. We have window units and radiator heaters we can put in it. It just needs to not have a leaking roof, have working electrical and plumbing. I cannot afford to buy one for him on my own. This is where you guys come in. I am open for any ideas of how to help him. I hate to ask for money because I know a lot of us are not in a good position to fork over a bunch of money. Do any of you guys have any idea how I can get help for him? Any programs or churches that can help? I will get pictures of his current trailer tomorrow. It is sad guys.

Any help is appreciated!

He has just returned from harrowing three weeks in hospital and a rehab facility complicated by quarantine put in place due to the Covid 19 outbreak and it has been determined for at least the time being, that he is unable to live on his own. In the interim Clyde is being hosted and cared for by his friends and neighbors in the Community of Bynum.As many of you who have experienced this gem of a human being know despite all the Folk Art world accolades, he has through all these years remained a man of simple means. He chose early on in his career to donate his art to organizations and agencies supporting primarily child-centric causes rather than sell his work to the highest bidder. In fact and you may not know this, he even turned down the internationally famous ballet dancer Baryshikov when he offered to buy one of Clyde’s critters.[Side Note: Here’s a sweet and wonderful video of some of Clyde’s biggest fans telling the story of Clyde and Mikhail.]And now after all these years of caring, giving and building community Clyde with limited financial resources and the specter of some variety of long-term care looming is in need of our help. Thing is most of us here in the Community of Bynum are artists, musicians or just regular working folks and of rather modest means ourselves. Initially the funds donated will go to cover a myriad of services and supplies that Medicare will not pay for and may also eventually be needed to pay for home improvements which may include widening doors, building ramps to improve access or even modifying bathroom facilities.This is why we’re reaching out.To friends and fellow artists, causal admirers and Folk Arts fanatics, the kindly caring patron saints of the kindly caring aging Folk Artists who are lovers of everything Clyde. He's given us so much. Now it's time for us to give something back.Please consider donating and help us to allow him to continue to age with dignity and receive the care that he so dearly deserves. And folks if we may ask, after you do donate would you please also share this Go Fund Me Campaign with anyone and everybody who you know whether or not they personally know Clyde, have experienced his art or just really appreciate a good story about an internationally known ballet star and a simple Folk Artist from the little town of Bynum, North Carolina.The Community of Bynum thanks you.Read more"

After avisit to the vet they believe shehasspinal cord compression which hasparalysed her back leg. We’ve been told unfortunately there are only two options. An MRI scan to see what is causing it, there thinking being cord compression due to a disc and needs to be operated on ASAP or rest and hope she gets better. If she does not get better she will have to be put to sleep.

For everyone who knows Belle, knowsshes full of character and still so young atheart. We’ve been estimated a cost for the surgery being 4-5 thousand pounds. This is not taking into account the MRIscan, rehab and meds!

Chandra is the most passionate and loyal person we have ever known, and she needs our help right now. On Valentine’s Day, Chandra was found down and unresponsive by a neighbor. She was rushed to the closest emergency room where she was found to have suffered a ruptured brain aneurysm. She was then transported to a different local hospital where she had a drain placed into her brain to drain the blood and relieve the pressure. Then thefollowing day, once she stabilized, they were able to take her back to the operating room for a 4 hour surgery to repair and place coils in the aneurysm that had ruptured and more coils into a different aneurysm they found. She is now breathing on her own and is slowly but surely coming around. She will have to be in the hospital for quite a while to monitor her vitals and the pressure on her brain, followed up by likely rehab.

Dave is the kind of person who would give you the shirt off his back and never think twice about it even in a snow storm. He has become like family to me and is in desperate need of help right now.

Unfortunately tragedy struck on July 31st 2020 when Dave was traveling home from his new job. Dave had to be life flighted back to the very hospital he works at. This accident is going to have major impacts to life for Dave and his family. Out of respect for his family I do not want to broadcast the details of his injuries, but he is in pretty rough shape. He is stable but has a very long road to recovery involving surgeries,rehab and therapy.

Please donate what you can or share if you can not donate. Even a small amount will go a long way. All funds will go directly to help with his medical care and expenses for his family who traveled from very south Florida to Kentucky to be by his side. The goal is just a starting point as I am sure he will need even more as time goes forward. I will post updates as I can and share more once his family has had time to process everything going on. Thank you for any help!

He was purchased in October of this 2020 through a generous grant from the Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians. Rex immediately began training with his handler, Sergeant Boyer. K9 Rex and Sergeant Boyer completed 370 of the required 400 hours to certify as a Patrol K9 team. During that, as with all of K9s, Rex lived with Sergeant Boyer and his family. Rex was welcomed as the newest member of their family, quickly becoming loved and adored by them. Rex is a goofy, loving animal with an over the top drive to play and work. He loves coming to work and training.On January 7, Rex suffered what is likely career ending injuries in what can only be described as a freak accident during training. Rex fell from a third story hallway to the first floor entrance. He landed on his front legs destroying the tendons and ligaments in his elbows and wrist. He was rushed to Pilchuck Veterinary Hospital in Snohomish for emergency treatment. Thankfully Rex did not suffer life threating injuries, but his road ahead is a long one. After consulting with Seattle Veterinary Specialist in Kirkland it was determined that Rex’s injuries were possibly career ending. The bones in Rex’s elbows and wrist will be fused together allowing him to walk and even run eventually. That said he has a long hard road of recovery ahead of him.The cost of surgery, treatment and rehab are expected to be $25,000 or more. In addition to medical bills, the K9 unit will need to purchase another K9 to fill Rex’s spot as a working dog while he recovers.Rex, as with several of the other K9’s, was purchased at Von Liche Kennels, out of Denver, Indiana. The K9’s cost between $10,000 - $12,000 with an associated $3,000 - $4,000 of expenses (travel, vet visits, equipment, etc.) to get them home and into training. These costs, especially in this sudden and unexpected event, pose a significant hurdle to overcome.The Snohomish County K9 Foundation is a 501c3 devoted to supporting Police Canine Teams within Snohomish County. The K9 Foundation, formerly Pennies for Puppies and Ponies, was founded in 2002 by Carole White. Since then the K9 Foundation has been able to purchase almost all of the K9s for the Snohomish County Sheriff Canine Unit. Additionally the Foundation has been able to provide needed equipment and training for the K9s and Handlers that would otherwise not been possible. This is only made possible through generosity and commitment of the Community these K9’s and their Handlers serve.The Snohomish County K9 Foundation has started a GoFundMe with the goal of taking care of Rex and getting him healthy. The K9 Foundation aims to cover the cost of his medical bills and the impending replacement of Rex on the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office K9 team. The initial fundraising goal of $25,000 has been chosen. The support from the community for these dogs is overwhelming and we would like to thank you ahead of time for your generous donation. Any funds remaining after all medical expenses are covered will be put towards cost of filling Rex’s spot in the unit and continuing to support local K9 teams.Read more"

He sat in extreme pain in the hospital in Anguilla for 3 days waiting on assistance and answers, and then because the surgery he needs couldn't be performed on the island, we were forced to have him transported on a medi flight, to the United States.He is now in the hospital in Fort Lauderdale and waiting on surgery (hopefully tomorrow, 2/25).

While the surgical costs will be very high, I know that the surgery can be paid off in time on a payment plan. However it is also very important that he gets assistance at home post op. Services such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, medication and equipment is crucial to getting him back on his feet, and since he does not have insurance, we need to pay for this up front.The situation is urgent and any contribution would be so helpful.Other helpful things: positive words, thoughts, vibes, prayers etc!

Over the next few days several procedures were performed in an attempt to remove the clots and thus save her leg but these operations were unsuccessful. Ultimately Melissa and her doctors had to make the agonizing choice to perform a life-saving above knee amputation of her left leg. As a result of this medical emergency, she has incurred substantial medical bills and will be out of work for an indefinite amount of time as she rehabs her injury.

Chilibowl) had a severe stroke Dec 7, 2020 leaving his left side fully paralyzed. He was in COVID ICU for 2 weeks during which it was discovered he also had blood clots in his lungs as well as the one on his brain stem and had to be placed on a ventilator after his surgery. During this time he also lost his father Dec 12, 2020 (and had already feshly lost 2 uncles, Sept 12, 2020, Oct 21, 2020 then dad Dec 12 ). He is now living with his mother(75y.o.) who had to take a leave of absence from her job to care for him (24x7). He is on a feeding tube and the ""food"" is $511 a month (insurance does NOT cover that). His medicine is costing $200 a month and that is NOT including his insulin. Until he is able to get any disability compensation, he still has numerous bills which must be paid (Medical services, medicines, rehab services, basic bills, storage, and medically needed personal items). His health insurance ends Feb. 28, 2021 and it will take some time to procure all of the necessary documents to submit with his paperwork. If he has to opt for COBRA insurance, that is almost $600 per month. Even then, our understanding is it may take over a year to get any disability compensation. He is also a Military (Navy) Veteran. I believe 12 years total time between Enlisted and Active Reserves. We are seeking VA assistance as well, but again, many hoops, red tape, and paperwork. I know he is very humble and would never ask for a penny from anyone, but he is one of the first to always offer it to OTHERS. Currently his left side is severely limited in movement (no grip, now strength, and no motor control). His speech is slow and labored. He has very little ""depth of breath"". He has to use a wheelchair but cannot move it himself. He has been told he would not be able to drive for at least a year (if ever again) and that he would not be able to go back to his job as a pipe fitter. Before the stroke he was battling severe depression, so now he sees everything as hopeless, yet our mother and I keep telling him NOT to give up on HOPE! Even if it is $5 (if you have it) it WILL help. If you don't have any extra or just cannot donate because of your OWN financial issues, at least please say a prayer for health and financial blessings for him and our family. Know that we send those same prayers back to you for your own blessings! THANK YOU IN ADVANCE !Read more"

I love and miss you Cameron, and may your heart be lightened by seeing this outpouring of love for you. We will take good care of Ali and the kids, we promise! 


Cameron is “that guy”... the guy who posts dad jokes on the regular, and you notice when he doesn’t. The guy who will play round after round of Pretty Pretty Princess with his daughter and doesn’t destroy the photo evidence. The guy who twists and turns his one year old son around in the air until they are both in a giggling fit. He is the guy who found the love of his life in high school and has never let go of her, because he knew she was the best thing that ever happened to him. The guy who will pretend to be a dolphin just to make his sister laugh when she is crying. He is that guys who will work a double shift and then drive 45 minutes to see his reunited siblings for an hour. He is the guy who teaches his children to play Uno as soon as they can hold cards. The guy who always had a dozen dad jokes and memes at the ready for any situation. The guy who would give you the shirt off of his back, then ask for some tape and paper to make himself a paper shirt because... well... it is too cold to be naked.



Cameron is one of the best of us. He is an attentive father, changing diapers and doing bath time with a smile and a joke. He is the romantic in his marriage, always trying to find ways to make his wife feel like a queen and know that she is treasured and loved. He is a beautiful photographer, and a dedicated provider for his family.



This incredible guy was hit by a car while on his motorcycle on Thursday, October 29th- his son’s first birthday. He is in critical condition at a trauma facility in Seattle, fighting to recover from extensive injury. He has a brain bleed, is internally bleeding, fractured all his facial bones, has 7 fractured ribs, 5 spinal fractures, a fractured scapula, fractured arm, a punctured lung, both lungs have collapsed requiring him to be mechanically ventilated, a chest tube, torn ligaments in his wrist and knee, kidney damage, liver damage, and due to his condition we cannot attempt to wake him up enough to assess his neurological function.



Even with all of this though Cameron is doing what he always does and that is stepping up. He is fighting and the doctors are very optimistic that this will not take Cameron from us. His road to recovery will be very long, and we don’t have any way of knowing what his function will be yet. We just know that we love him, and need to help him and his beautiful family.



His strong, kind, and beautiful wife and their two perfect kids are going to need our help. So we are starting this to help with Cameron’s medical costs above his insurance, and to help pay for bills and rehab costs that Cameron will accumulate while recovering. We also want to be sure that his babies are well taken care of financially- able to buy food and clothes, etc while daddy is healing.So please, if you can help out “that guy”... the guy we love with all of our hearts, we would eternally appreciate it.

A mechanical engineer by profession, Mick loved to work on the car he is building i n his garage, when he wasn’t hanging out with the kids, cooking amazing meals or camping with the family. Life was good in its everyday normality. No one could ever have anticipated what was about to happen to dramatically change the lives of this young family.On Christmas Day 2018, Mick was cooking Christmas lunch and, like so many dads, assembling Amelia and Thomas’ new toys. Two days later Mick was on life support with his organs shutting down.Now Mick has undergone amputations to all four of his limbs and needs your help.The ABC's Australian Story have filmed Mick's journey and presented a feature programme on Mick and the family on 23 November 2019. It can be viewed here. This is Mick’s journey.Just before Christmas 2018, Mick complained of a sore gluteal muscle and saw a physio. He felt a bit better and continued with Christmas preparations with his family. On Christmas night, the pain in Mick’s glute was so severe that he went his local hospital’s emergency department. The diagnosis was Sciatica and he was sent home with anti-inflammatories. By Boxing Day Mick’s pain was significantly worse necessitating a return to the hospital where his low blood pressure and high temperature were noted. From this point on Mick quickly deteriorated. He was transferred by ambulance to the Intensive Care Unit at another Sydney hospital. Mick was placed on life support as his organs were shutting down. Mick had a Strep A infection in his leg causing necrotizing myositis, and septic shock. It is a common bacteria that started with a mild sore throat, the doctors don’t know how or why it got into his bloodstream and attacked his muscles. That night he underwent the first of many surgical procedures to remove infected and dead muscle from his buttock and thigh, to save his life.Mick’s organs were hit by the septic shock from the bacteria, causing limited functionality. The intense medication he was on to stabilise his blood pressure resulted in limited circulation, causing further damage to his limbs and extremities. The toxic shock also caused burn-like injuries to over 70% of Mick’s skin. Mick's arms and legs were dying, and he needed to have amputations to all four limbs to give him a chance at survival. Mick's first amputations were carried out on 16th January 2019. He has since had numerous trips to theatre to clean out his wounds, deal with further infection, and complete a muscle flap transfer to cover the initial infection site. Mick's arms are now both amputated below the elbow, and both his legs are amputated above the knee. He has undergone multiple skin grafts, and has had to have his right shoulder replaced due to dead and crumbling bone. Mick spent the whole of 2019 in hospital before finally returning home to his family to begin his new life as a quadruple amputee. The futureIt is encouraging that the position of Mick’s arm amputations mean that he should be able to manage well on prosthetics. Mick has begun on the long journey of learning to use prosthetic arms, and trialling different types of technology. The rehab doctors have also explained that hand prosthetics are now vastly improved. Using myoelectric prosthetics Mick should have a good range of movement, control and ability. Getting back to work, being active and involved in his family is a really important part of who Mick is, and will be central to his recovery and wellbeing.Mick is one of the most determined people you will meet, he has never before given up on anything and it is clear that he doesn’t plan to start now! His inspirational strength and determination to live have been instrumental in him overcoming extraordinary obstacles, and give him the best chance of success in dealing with the many new challenges his life will involve.How you can helpLife as they knew it will never be the same again for Mick, Katharine, Amelia and Thomas. Financial support from friends and the community around them, however, will make a significant difference in ensuring the new chapter of their lives is the best it could possibly be.Thanks to the amazing skill and dedication of the medical staff and Mick’s family, not to mention his own strength and will to live, Mick now has a future to look forward to. Please help us to make that future a bit easier by considering a donation to Mick and his family.All funds raised will be designated for Mick’s mobility, assistive technology aids and prosthetics, over the course of his life. This will allow Mick to live a fulfilling life, return to meaningful work and continue to be the involved father he has always been to Amelia and Thomas. Amelia and Thomas are young enough to adjust to their new life and, with time, their memory of what happened to their dad may fade. Your gift will make a significant difference to the family’s adjustment to their new life and the childhood of two precious children.Thank you in advance for your kindness and generosity.￼Read more"

Richmond, CA-Car accident


THIS IS THE ONLY FUNDRAISER FOR ALYSSA AND FAMILYWe are the uncle and aunt to Alyssa, Mariano and Lisa. We have set up this GoFundMe with permission of parents Karl and Brandi.09/04/20 9:30pm Alyssa works at Target, a senior in high school, pays for her own car, insurance and clothes and helps with her 12 year old sister, 5 year old brother and her 1 year old sister. She was off of work and texted her mom she was going to get chips for her brother because promised she him as he had shots that day and told her mom she was buying her some chicken. She texted around 9:49am she was on her way home. She was not home by 10:25 so mom called her and had that mothers instinct...and an off duty San Quentin Officer, Sergeant William (Fred) Eberly, who was first on scene and kept her breathing answered after mom repeatedly called and told her about the car accident. Brandi begged for Alyssa to hold on. Karl and Brandi rushed in the car but freeway was packed because of the accident so Karl left the drivers seat and ran over a mile to the sight on the freeway. He said when he saw the car it looked like it rolled multiple times and he couldn’t believe how Alyssa made it. The car did not roll but had heavy impacts. No witnesses. The first person they saw was the officer they spoke to on the phone but didn’t know it was him at the time. They would not let him in ambulance because they were trying to keep her breathing.09/05/205 hour surgery to decrease swelling and insert a metal plate because of fractured skull and fractures imbedded in brain.09/06/20Today they will slow sedation to see how she responds


This will be a long process for the family of 6 and the money will help support the family at this time so the parents can be by her side.Thank you and we will update daily.Please share!

Three days later she was on the operating table having the fluid drained from the non-cancerous cyst in her brain.The following week she was released from hospital and was able to recover comfortably at home and was back to her normal self enjoying the school holidays and Christmas with her family.This brings us to now, she went in for a routine check-up late March which resulted in the doctors asking for her to have another eye test which found that the cyst on her brain had built again, and another operation to drain the fluid was scheduled.We took her into hospital on 14th April for further tests and another operation which was scheduled for the 17th. Unfortunately, during that operation something went severely wrong which was not a result of her condition. Due to this Taylah has irreparable severe brain damage which will mean that she will always need fulltime care. In the coming weeks she had another two operations to help lessen the damage that was created in the first operation and release pressure. Taylah at this stage is nonresponsive, she cannot control her movements, cannot control her bowels and cannot sit up in a wheelchair and 5 weeks later she is still in hospital.As you could imagine this has put a massive strain on our family life, due to the current times with Covid-19 we as a family cannot be in the hospital at the same time. Taylah’s mum Mel will not be able to return to work as she will now need to become a full-time carer for Taylah. We also are working extremely hard to bring her home, to do this we need to modify the house to accommodate for Taylah’s condition we will also need to obtain a vehicle that would need be converted to accommodate her wheelchair. Taylah will need ongoing rehab both in and out of the home.We have also spoken with a Doctor in Sydney who has told us of advancements in stimulating therapy of the brain which is new technology that has been used in America where a machine stimulates the damaged pathways that are no longer working and they have had some great successes with this technology, the Doctor believes that Taylah could benefit from this technology.She is not a candidate for the Technology just yet due to her still being too unwell, but he believes that once the travel restrictions are lifted we should arrange to get Taylah up to Sydney when she is a little better and start on this therapy as soon as possible.We have started this Go Fund Me page in the hope to raise funds so we can get the family home converted and bring Taylah home, purchase a suitable vehicle and most importantly arrange for Taylah to be taken up to Sydney to have the new Stimulus therapy on her brain.For Taylah to have the therapy in Sydney for the 6 months, this will cost in excess of $100,000 alone.This therapy treatment could take up to 6 months to get the best outcome which would mean we would need to be in Sydney for this entire time as there is no where in Melbourne that offers this treatment.Thank you for the time in reading Taylah’s story and any assistance that you can offer will be greatly appreciated, as this will go such a long way in helping our family financially dealing with this heart breaking situation we now find ourselves in.Thank you for supporting Cameron, Melanie, Taylah and OliviaRead more"

Words are insufficient to express my sadness, I now have a hole in my life and my heart that will never be filled. Here is her story. My daughter Katrina was struck down and paralyzed with a disease called Guillain-Barre Syndrome, which is a rare disorder in which your body's immune system attacks your nerves. She was hospitalized for a month and in physical rehab hospital for 2 mos. Since then she has worked hard at her Physical and Occupational Therapy, slowly improving so she could walk and go to college, earning 3 AA Degrees and a Certificate despite her challenges.Unfortunately, she experienced liver failure when we were in Phoenix at the Mayo Clinic for her orthopedic operation needed for her to walk again. We came home to New Mexico at the end of November, hoping her liver would heal so she could eventually have her operation. It did not.Katrina passed away Saturday evening in her bed at home. She is finally not in pain anymore and won't have to fight and struggle any more. We will have a celebration of her life next month on Valentine's Day.

She and her family hoped to spend one more trip to California to make some fond memories to end a crappy year with. While they were at the beach, Chelsie had a huge wave crash down on her back while playing in the water, the force was strong enough that it caused a clean break in her spinal column just below the rib cage, there is also a fracture. This morning before surgery she had no feeling from the belly button down. The doctor said that it looks as if Chelsie was involved in a high speed car accident, that is how hard she was hit. She is in surgery to repair the break with screws and a rod being put in place to strengthen her spine. We don’t know what the outcome will be until the surgery is over. But, there will be many months of rehab and physical therapy ahead for her. As soon as she is able to be moved, we need to bring her home to Utah and find a facility that can help her with the rehab that is ahead of her.As both Chelsie and her husband are school teachers, money is always tight for them but with the funds from this GoFundMe we are hoping to narrow the gap between what insurance wont cover and her lost wages.

Thankfully, the hard work of his loving doctors have proved to be aiding in his healing process. The pneumonia has become less severe, Eric has been able to acknowledge his family in his hospital room, and will hopefully begin receiving visitors again soon. He has incredible doctors by his side and even better his mom and brothers.

(Chicago Tribune)After two terrible days for family and friends, in which Jermell suffered a stroke and was induced into a coma, his care at University of Chicago Hospital brought him back to life. However, a long road to recovery and a mountain of expenses await the 25 year old. He will remain in the hospital until he can swallow food; doctors are expecting a year of physical therapy to regain the ability to walk and speech therapy to relearn how to speak in complete sentences.Jermell, a loving father of a 5-year old son, is a lifelong bicycle rider and mechanic. His passion began at Blackstone Bicycle Works in a youth program that gave him access to bikes, tools, parts, mentors, and peers that would eventually guide him to his current position as a professional mechanic for Chicago’s city bike program, Divvy.Through a love of bikes, Jermell and his peers formed a community that extended beyond the blocks they grew up on, beyond the sets and gangs that dominate our neighborhoods. This community extends across the country, from Chicago to Gallup, New Mexico, where Jermell helped to build a bicycle co-op. This attack, the struggles of recovery, and the precarious financial situation that Jermell finds himself in should motivate all of us to step up and give a helping hand because this community is strong and won’t let violence pull down one of our own.Jermell’s current expenses include rent, car payments, hospital bills and rehab/therapy costs. At this time, it’s very difficult to estimate exactly how much assistance Jermell will need but it’s clear that any amount will help. Please, give what you can!

Hello my names Paul Walters but my mates know me as Dougie . 
As by now most of us would be aware our mate Brett ""Steady""Charlton a few days ago had a stroke. 
From talking to Tammie it was a frontal lobe stroke and a massive one.
Its fair to say this is not a good thing and rehab will be slow and long .
Holidays and sick leave only go so far,but sadly house repayments and car repayments need to keep being payed.
With Brett out of action for a while it will fall back onto Tam to keep working to pay the bills .
This in itself will be hard especially looking after Lottie and Brylee and trying to get Brett up and going again .
Needless to say it will be a tough task.
Steady as i like to call him would never ask for help,but as his mate im asking for it in his time of need.
Hes a great bloke that always has time for his mates and his family. With xmas fast approaching lets try and make things a bit easier for him and his family even if its just $5 .as they say every cent helps.
Cheers and thanks for your support Dougie

He was transported to Boca Regional Medical Center and within the hour, he was in surgery.Craig received the best possible treatment to remove the clot from his brain. He was in the Marcus Neuro Institute ICU for 11 days and Memorial Rehab for 7 days. He is now home with a long road to recovery. The stroke occurred on the left side of his brain and has affected his speech, memory, vision, and balance.Craig is the EMS Division Chief of Boca Raton Fire Rescue where he has served the City of Boca Raton for the last 17 years. Prior to that he was a Firefighter/Paramedic with Riviera Beach Fire Rescue and also served the United States Air Force as a Firefighter. He is also extremely active in his boys' lives, especially their sports and travel teams. When he is not at a game, he can be found playing catch in the yard, swimming, or playing basketball with the boys.Craig's treatment plan and future are difficult and unknown.

The funds raised will be used to cover his medical bills and other financial obligations or needs that the family may have.

Her only daughter Niccole has been talking with her employer to see about workmans comp, but with this new pandemic they are unsure if this will be covered even though over 20 residents have tested positive, in additionto employees. Sheila started feeling symptoms on April 15th experiencing a fever, cough and body aches. On April 16th she tested positive for Covid 19 and was admitted to Skyridge Hospital on April 17th. Her oxygen levels continued to drop and on April 19th she was moved to ICU and placed on a ventilator. While at Skyridge her vitals continued to decline and the decision was made to transfer her to the Medical Center of Aurora in the early morning hours of April 27th where they have more resources including an ECMO. She has remained on life support at the Medical Center of Aurora ever since. During this time she has required medications to regulate her heart, continuous dialysis, and other life saving measures. If she is able to fight the virus, she will remain hospitalized or in a rehab center for the next several months. Her only daughter Niccole has been trying to balance all of this while also being a mother, and a first responder, while not being allowed to see her mom or hold her hand. Any help, including prayers is much appreciated as Sheila still has monthly bills, as well as the medical bills that are starting to accrue.Thank you!I am Deanna McCaul of Commerce City, CO, and I am organizing this campaign on behalf of my colleague Niccole Gibson who is Sheila's daughter. Niccole is the sole beneficiary for this campaign and will be using the funds collected to help pay Sheila's monthly expenses while she is in the hospital, in addition to medical bills including hospital stay as well as the rehab facility for when she is hopefully discharged from the hospital.Read more"

On August 22, 2020 at about 7:45 pm, a group of preachers decided to set up speakers and a microphone at the corner of Burnaby and Thurlow Streets. This is the second time they’ve done so this summer. The first time, they shared their homophobic and transphobic ideologies into their microphones for over an hour. Residents of the neighbourhood actively called the police asking for these individuals to be stopped - to no avail. The location of their preaching was not unplanned given the historic LGBTQIA2s+ history of Vancouver’s west end. 2020 has brought with it the call to action for civilians to stand up and fight against intolerance and bigotry. Justin did exactly this by confronting this group of religious extremist who believed they had a right to spread hate speech. Justin is proud of what he did but unfortunately he was violently assaulted and seriously injured. Luckily, police and ambulance were on scene. Justin was taken to hospital having both bones in his left leg broken and his left knee dislocated. Vancouver Police indicate that two individuals are in custody and facing possible charges of aggravated assault and mischief. The VPD hate crime investigators have also been notified. In the coming months, Justin will be faced with medical bills, a loss of income, legal fees, rent and living costs. It will be some time before rehab is completed and he is able to return to work. He badly needs the help of his family and friends to manage this tragic turn of events.

Avalon has made it public today that she has been diagnosed with Brain Cancer. This devastating news comes three days after a post surgery appointment to discuss the pathology of her Brain Tumor. Avalon underwent a 16 hour surgery on February 26th to remove a tumor the size of peach, in her front left temporal lobe.

Although the surgeons removed the majority of the tumor, they feel an immediate second surgery is necessary, followed by weeks of radiation and chemotherapy.Avalon has minimal insurance,is an independent artist, and self-supporting singer/ songwriter. We hope to help her with some of the financial burden as a result of these medical expenses.

No amount is too little. We are so grateful for anyone willing to share this post or donate. We appreciate your prayers and positive thoughts as we prepare to battle this disease.

It's already metastasized to the bones and spine, as well as blood. One of the tumors on the base of his spine caused paralysis in his lower half, and in spite of surgery, it appears the paralysis will sadly be permanent. His condition is terminal. If you know Mark, then you know how unbelievable this news is. He was just playing volleyball a few weeks ago! He’s such an active, hard-working guy. (Not to mention easy-going and incredibly kind.) How could this happen?Over the past few, short weeks since Mark received this devastating diagnosis - at an ER visit for what we thought were kidney stones - he has quickly become exhausted and weak from debilitating pain, and intense chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Physical and occupational therapy take what remaining strength he has left. This has been so hard. For Mark, first and foremost, who is faced with the reality that his time here on earth is coming to an end. How can someone face that? I can’t imagine... And for us as his family, it’s been excruciating to see him go through this. We want to take it all away. But as much as we try to bargain with God (and desperately try to find miracle cures), we cannot.We are incredibly thankful for the quality care he’s received so far, from many kind and caring professionals at UPMC and Lancaster Rehab. Thank you, if you’re one of these individuals. You bless us by taking care of our precious “popi”. Here’s where things stand now. Mark spent a few weeks in the hospital following the cancer diagnosis, and is now at a rehab hospital in PA. He'll be there until Saturday, when he’ll be moved home under hospice care. My Mom will become his primary caregiver, and will have to stop working to do so. We don’t know how ends will meet. In spite of what has become the focus of our reality, life will go on around us. Routine electric and water bills will continue to roll in, the mortgage will need to be paid, groceries purchased, the car maintained, etc., etc. We’re in the process of rearranging Mom and Mark’s home to accomodate a hospital bed and to create wheelchair accessibility. Adaptations will likely need to be made to showers, doorways, and many more areas than we’ve considered, I’m sure. God-willing, this will all help Mark enjoy a little freedom outside of a medical facility, and be in the comfort of his own home. We don’t know how long he has. We’re still praying for a miracle, but we must prepare for the current reality.As you can imagine, this sudden illness has thrown the Halsey household into very trying financial times.Medical bills are already rolling in. At the very least, my Mom and Mark will have thousands to pay in co-pays. My Mom will lose her income soon, and eventually, Mark’s paid leave will run out. There will be financial burdens beyond what we can plan for.Our family is asking for your help during this heart-wrenching time. If you're able to help with a monetary donation - no matter how small - we would be so grateful. We know Mark's time left on this earth is limited. But, however much time that may be, we want it tobe filled with quality time with family and friends, love, and hopefully a little laughter, too. It will certainly give some much-needed peace of mind to know that finances are taken care of.If you can't spare a donation, we ask you to please, please pray - as often and as fervently as you can. For ongoing strength for Mom and Mark, for peace of mind, for an easing of pain, for capable and skilled medical professionals overseeing care, for fortitude, for hope, and yes, for healing... We may not know each of you personally, but you're connected to us in some way. And for your support, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.Mark, you have our hearts...Rachel, Meghan, Abi, and EvanRead more"

JOE ALLEN JR, NEEDS OUR HELP.This past Saturday night July 21, in George, Washington at the music  venue the Gorge our friend Joe was the victim of a malicious attack.  Near the end of the second set of music a man assaulted Joe with a rock to the back of his head then disappeared into the crowd. Joe was rushed to a local medical facility where he had to have pressure relieved from the swelling in his brain.

Luckily Joe is still with us, but his road to recovery will not be easy. Joe has nine staples in the back of his head from the wound. Joe is still experiencing numbness in his hands and has not yet regained the ability to walk on his own. He has a fractured skull, and he needs to do a lot of rehab at a neurological facility. As you can imagine all of this adds up and anything we can do as a community to help Joe would be greatly appreciated.Joe is a wonderful person and loving father of four. Its been my pleasure in life to have known him for the last 35 years and I cant wait till we are dancing together again. Please help get our brother back on his feet. Joe is currently recovering at Confluence Hospital in Wenatchee Wa.**-**Update Wednesday July 25 10;54 am est.**-**I spoke with Joe just moments ago as he is preparing to go into surgery this morning. They need to clear some room in his spine so that information can begin to move. Their hope is that the pains he is feeling will subside and this will help with some of his motor functions. I will post more when he is out of surgery and I have spoken with him again.

Joe wanted me to thank everyone for their kindness he definitely feels the love.

He has suffered extensive injuries; both forearms broken, his upper arms broken in two different places , a broken pelvis, one broken leg, and a slight head injury as well as some other wounds that are being sutured and taken care of. To say that was the hardest day of my life was an understatement. I’ve never been so scared and grateful at the same time in my entire life. Kyle is currently in the ICU and is making small progress each and every day. He’s finally talking again (YAY!). Unfortunately, a driver was not paying attention and hit Kyle with their car. Let me take a moment for a PSA: PLEASE WATCH FOR MOTORCYCLES. These people were reckless and it almost cost Kyle his life. His family and I are doing everything we can physically and financially but the extra costs are going to be a burden. The driver does not have good insurance. His road to recovery is going to be a long one with extensive rehab and special accommodations at home. We are asking for your help, even if it’s just $20, to get Kyle back on his feet ❤️ I can never replace the love and joy he has brought to my life and I want to see to it that I can restore those things for him at the end of this.

p>After battling Covid-19 at home for over one week, while 39 weeks pregnant with her and Derek's fourth child, Kelsey was taken to the ER on Wednesday, Nov. 4th after she began having much difficulty breathing. Upon arrival at the hospital, she was found to have oxygen levels in the 40s. She was admitted to the ICU where she was sedated and put on a ventilator. Once her breathing was controlled, it was decided baby needed to be delivered via c-section. Kelsey remains intubated and in critical condition, and has received convalescent plasma from a donor who has recovered from Covid-19. The antibodies will potentially help Kelsey fight off the virus.Please pray for Kelsey and the entire family that she continues to fight this fight so she can get home to her babies and husband!

At around 2:15-2:30 AM early Thursday morning, June 22nd, Nick suffered an accident while riding his motorcycle on the way home from a night out with his friends. He was less than 1/4 from being home where the accident occurred. Alcohol was not the reason. The circumstances of the accident are unclear unfortunately. Nick suffered a traumatic brain injury which included a right sided skull fracture and brain bleeding. It is assumed he was wearing his helmet at the time of the accident (since there is damage on the helmet in the same area as his injuries) but that it fell off after the initial hit and the subsequent hits caused the damage. Nick was moved to UCI Medical Center and currently resides in the surgical ICU. He remains intubated on very heavy sedation and requires a breathing tube to help him breathe. He also has a drain placed in his head to relieve swelling and pressure build-up. He has been able to move his extremities involuntarily and his pupils react appropriately, but he is unable to respond to commands as he is under so much sedation, so the extent of the damage done to his brain cannot be fully determined at this time. The expectation is that Nick will require many weeks if not months in the hospital and even longer time potentially to rehab as he is likely to have significant physical deficits. Any monetary donations or prayers are greatly appreciated as they will all be used towards his bills, medical expenses and children since he can not work. His girls need their daddy and his mom, brother and I need him as well as his entire family and friends!

**update**



This month will mark one year since Jennie’s first hospitalization. 3 major surgeries, 3 months in Brigham and womens hospital, and 4 months in two different inpatient rehabs later Jennie is still fighting to get her life back. Jennie is still unable to walk, form sentences, or use her dominant right arm. It has become clear that it will be years, if ever, that she will be able to be self sufficient. While we are overwhelmingly greatful for all the help we have so far received, Jennie's unplanned ileostomy surgery in June set her recovery back in ways we could not imagine. We know that Covid has made things hard for everyone, but just like no one could have ever expected a world wide pandemic, never in a million years did we think this could ever happen to Jennie. Please help keep Jennie focused on her recovery, and not worry about how we will continue live in this beautiful place we call home.








As many of our friends and family know, Jennie suffered a massive stroke at the end of February caused by complications from her ulcerative colitis. Jennie underwent double brain surgery and had a craniectomy on her left side to allow the brain to swell. After two weeks in a medically induced coma, Jennie was moved out of the ICU to the neurology recovery floor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. She was transferred to Spaulding Rehab in Charlestown on March 24th and has been making steady progress since her arrival. The stroke affected her right-side motor skills and the area of the brain that controls speech and language comprehension. Currently, Jennie is starting to regain some use of her right leg, and able to walk with the aid of a leg brace, cane, and assistance for short distances. She can fully understand what is said to her, but has trouble using speech to express herself, and still has no motor function in her right arm. We are thrilled that Jennie will be coming home on May 5th, but we have to make our home more assessable for Jennie while she recuperates. The immediate projects include replacing the front steps, building ramps, and installing handrails and grab bars. Jennie will also need a lift assist recliner so she has a comfortable chair to support her. These are just a few of the modifications that are needed immediately, and I’m sure many more will present themselves as we move forward. The Coronavirus has complicated recovery, and Jennie’s surgery to replace her “left bone flap” is on hold. This means she will need 24-hour supervision to make sure that she does not hit her head. I will have to take a long leave of absence from work to care for her, and I have unfortunately used up all sick leave since the initial stroke.It is uncertain if or when Jennie will be able to work again, so any funds left over from the renovations will be used to help pay our bills, and procure items Jennie may require to continue on her path to recovery. We appreciate any and all help in these troubling and turbulent times, stay safe, stay healthy, and THANK YOU!Much love,Andrew, Jennie, & T-boneRead more"

On June 27, just two days before my wedding, I was told by the surgeon that the only option for treatment was an amputation of the forefoot due to the size of the tumor and how it had spread through the tissue. Our honeymoon had to be canceled. On July 7, 2014 the amputation was done. I went through extensive healing and rehab and eventually was fitted with a prosthetic in November of 2014. Months went by before I could return to work and normal activities but I did and I live my life to the fullest. I had x-rays and follow ups every 3 months with my doctor. This was to look for metastases on my lungs.In October, 2015 they saw spots on my lungs in my x-rays. After doing a CT scan the doctor informed me that the cancer is back and had metastasized to both lungs. The doctor told me it is stage 4 and offered aggressive chemotherapy treatments which I started November 30th, 2015. I was told that the chemo will not cure me but will give me a chance for more time. The prognosis for this kind of cancer has a median of one year with aggressive chemo treatments. But I'm not most patients..... I want to fight!!! I will fight with everything I've got and with my family by my side.

We are writing now to share her story, and we pray that you can help. Carrie doesn’t remember much about what happened that night.But she does remember the horror of being trapped in the car with her son for 40 minutes. The front of the car was completely smashed in with such a big impact, that her right leg burst out of the hip socket, breaking her hip in two places. The pain was excruciating. Carrie suffered many serious injuries including lacerations, a broken hip, femur, and sternum.Carrie was understandably confused for a few minutes (and may have suffered a concussion), but focused again when she heard her son crying in the back seat. Despite her intense pain, she reached back to assess his condition and comfort him. We are all so grateful that her precious boy survived the accident with no serious injuries. Praise God!::: Carrie is a dedicated and loving mother. We are allso grateful her son was not severly injured in the accident. :::That night was so frightening, and intensely painful, but just the beginning of a very long journey. After pushing Carrie’s leg back into place in the emergency room, doctors admitted Carrie to the hospital to await surgery, and to start weeks of therapy to learn to sit, stand, and walk again. The first days were so difficult, but we were grateful when Carrie was accepted to Sutter Rehab (inpatient) Institute to facilitate her recovery.The path ahead will be long. Doctors say she will be in the hospital/rehab for 3 weeks, and even after going home, she will have to be attended to 24 hours a day for weeks. With no family close by, we are trying to figure out how to make her home suitable for her. She’ll be using a walker for months, and needs quite a bit of adaptive equipment to be able to sit, stand, bathe, walk, sleep, and dress. Even getting into the home or a car is a problem that must be resolved before she can leave the rehab center. In addition to the physical and emotional challenges, Carrie could be financially crippled because of this accident.::: Carrie is making great progress learning to stand, sit and walk again. :::::: At the hospital with my daughter Carrie just a day or two after surgery to repair her broken and dislocated hip. :::Your donation will help Carrie:· Pay for medical bills. She has already maxed out her 2016 out of pocket maximum with medical expenses, and will continue accruing more medical debt in 2017 with ongoing therapies and other follow-up medical care as she continues her recovery. Her out-of-pocket medical expenses are estimated to cost at least $12,500, not counting any treatment that isn’t covered under insurance. · Purchase medical equipment and build on changes to help Carrie live in her home. Carrie must have a platform and ramp installed before she can enter her home. She also needs a modified bathroom to accommodate her disability. Carrie will not be able to stand up to take a shower for months and needs specialized medical equipment to get her basic needs met. She’ll need a walker, wheelchair, tub transfer bench, commode, raised chairs, and other adaptive tools. Medical equipment and necessary home modifications are estimated to cost $3,500.· Purchase a vehicle that can accommodate her physical limitations and disabilities. Carrie’s 10-year-old car was totalled in the accident. The insurance payout will be a fraction of what she will need to purchase a larger vehicle. This will cost between $20,000 to $40,000.·   Help support the living expenses andthe many incidentals that occur with a disabling injury. Carrie will be incapacitated and unable to work for a time. Any financial support will help her provide for herself and her son. ::: Some of our children and grandchildren taken this summer a few months before the accident. Carrie on the far right. :::As her parents, we love Carrie and her precious son so much, and are doing as much as we can to support her. I (Bonnie) flew to California the day after her accident and stayed with her for a week. I’ll be heading back when she goes home from rehab to help her at home for the first couple of weeks. We’re doing everything we can, but Carrie needs more help financially then we can provide. Any donation you can make would be very much appreciated and will go towards Carrie’s recovery and to provide for her 4 y/o son as she is a single mother.We want to thank you for your prayers for Carrie and her son–and any donation you can make. We deeply appreciate your support.Funds raised by this campaign will go directly to Carrie to help manage the overwhelming expenses resulting from this accident. Contributing to this fund is a tangible and much needed way we all can chip in to help her out financially during this difficult time. Please give what you can. We are so grateful!

Due to complications after surgery it was determined she had no brain activity.These funds will be donated to the Haire family for funeral expenses.Posted from Prayers for the Haire Family and updates: ""Yesterday shortly after 2:30pm, after extensive testing, Brooke was declared legally brain dead. While our hearts are broken, in our minds there was only one choice to make and we have chosen to donate Brooke's organs. It is our hope that we can spare another family the pain and heartache that we are facing. Brooke will not only continue to live in our hearts but will be able to give someone a second chance at life.""___________________________________________________________Posted from previous Go Fund Me campaign ""Standing Tall for Brooke"":As a parent, I want to be able to give Brooke everything. For our family, everything means so much more than it did three years ago. As many of you know, Brooke was involved in a car accident October 13th, 2014 along with her eight month old sister Aubrey. Unfortunately, Aubrey passed away as a result of the car accident in the hours that followed, and Brooke sustained a c4 spinal cord injury. Due to the level of her injury, Brooke is paralyzed from the neck down and on a ventilator full time. In the days that followed our car accident, Brooke had a spinal fusion surgery as well as surgery to place a pacemaker, cervical shunt, trach and gtube. In the beginning, doctors weren't sure of Brookes prognosis. She suffered a tramautic brain injury in addition to the spinal cord injury, and we were prepared for the worst. Doctors didn't believe Brooke would ever breath again on her own, be able to walk, be able to feed herself or even eat again. We were prepared for significant memory loss, and the possibility of cognitive impairment. It truly was a nightmare we were living. While making funeral arrangements for one child, we were faced with the life altering decisions and changes our oldest daughter faced. Despite all the odds stacked against her, Brooke has made strides in her recovery. Brookes TBI hasn't affected her as drastically as we were prepared for, and although she is still on the vent and unable to move from the neck down, she works extremely hard week after week to regain whatever abilities she can. We have been so fortunate to have the medical care nearby to assist in her growth and development. After months in inpatient rehab at Levine Children's Hospital, we were able to bring Brooke home. Since being home, we have transistioned out of homebound rehab into an outpatient setting. Every week we travel forty five minutes to an hour away for physical and occupational therapy, in addition to keeping regularly scheduled doctors appointments also the same distance. Brooke has a team of doctors working to ensure she stays stable, including her primary care physician, neurosurgeon, cardiologist, urologist, rehab doctor, and pulmonologist. Brooke has worked hard stregthening her head and neck muscles enabling her to use a head array to drive her power wheelchair. The independence she has gained from use of this as been immeasurable. Brooke was also able to start kindergarten on track this past fall in a regular classroom with a full-time nurse able to aid her throughout the day. She loves school so much and she excels in her studies. At the end of the school year, Brooke was reading on the highest level a kindergartener is tested at. The schools assistive technology department has enabled her to independently participate in class work with the use of aids such as a headmouse used with a Mac book pro, and an iPad with accessible switches attached to her wheelchair.Although we are allotted nursing, currently (and for the majority of the time we've been home from the hospital) we are not receiving even a quarter of the nursing care we are allotted. As a parent, I'm sure you can understand how difficult it is to raise a family on one income and be able to meet all the needs of the family. To be able to do so, you have to make sacrifices. Right now, my husband is the only one working, as I'm Brookes full-time caregiver. At this point, there is no way I could go back to work as Brooke doesn't have consistency with nursing to allow me the opportunity to seek employment. Instead, I'm doing everything I can to push Brookes body and abilities as much as possible for the opportunity for her to have as much recovery as possible. As I stated to start with, I want to give my children everything. For Brooke, everything is a lot harder to give her than a child without her limitations. For her, everything is as simple as things you and I take for granted every day, the ability to walk, the ability to write, or to play games with her friends. This summer Brooke was able to go to a week long summer day camp at Wings of Eagles ranch. I can't begin to tell you what that week has done in my child's life. She went from having multiple muscle spasms an hour, down to three for the entire week. I seen an increase in her core strength and head control after she spent the week riding horses, and doing other outdoor adventures they make available for kids of all abilities. On top of the physical benefits, emotionally camp was also very rewarding as Brooke never felt defeated, instead she felt uplifted and encouraged, and above all, she felt capable. On top of camp, Brooke also continues to dance, and this year even competed with a lyrical duet she and her dance instructor worked hard to perfect. Brooke still dreams of dancing in the nutcracker one day. She also loves to sing, to anyone that will listen, and she she has no fear when it comes to belting out tunes. After her insistence, we just helped Brooke compete in her first beauty pageant since her spinal cord injury. She had a wonderful time and even won the Spirit Queen title for the Mount Pleasant Independence Day pageant. As you can see, Brooke is driven, and fearless. We work hard at home to make sure she's able to live her life to the fullest, despite being physically limited. That's where you come in. We would love for Brooke to participate in a more rigorous weight bearing therapy program, and after searching, we found somewhere within an hours drive that offers that type of program. Race to Walk charges $85 an hour, and has recommended that Brooke have two to three, one to two hour sessions a week. School is quickly approaching and I feel that we should make the most of the last few weeks she is home, before school and regular doctors and therapy visits fill our schedules. Because Race to Walk isnt classified as physical or occupational therapy, instead as Neuro fitness specialists, insurance won't cover the cost of treatment. Once school starts back, we would also like to have Brooke start regular hippa therapy at Wings of Eagles ranch. As of right now, insurance isn't available to cover the cost of this. In addition to these two therapies, we would also like to be able to buy Brooke her own computer and headmouse to be used at home so that she is able to continue independently learning and interacting with her peers. Right now, the school has allowe us use of their equipment over the summer, and Brooke is amazing with what she can do on that computer. She can write math equations, is able to draw using her head (this includes writting using her head and the headmouse), and type using an on-screen keyboard. She loves playing games and reading on her computer in addition to educational uses. A family member is working to provide Brooke with the computer, but we still need be able to provide the headmouse and software, which is priced around $1600. Brooke has shown the world what it means to believe God is our ultimate healer. No matter what obstacles she's faced, she's continued to improve and remain joyful. Doctors have made many predictions that have been wrong when it comes to Brooke. We fully believe Brooke will make a full recovery, but we know we have to keep pushing, and keep fighting for new and cutting edge treatments and technologies along the way. God promises us that where we are now is not where we will end up, and because of that, I believe by continuing to push for more recovery, Brooke will be a testimony to the will of the Lord. Thank you for taking time to read a little about Brooke, and for sharing our story. Our online community, in addition to friends and family, have blessed our family in more ways than we could ever repay. www.facebook.com/cristenhaireRead more"

She was not complaining of dizziness, but rather that her muscles felt weak. She went to appointment after appointment to find out what was going on with her body. They ordered images and ran tests, but due to a series of unfortunate events and medical negligence, our mom was not informed about the mass that was found on her brain in an MRI scan done on March 6th until March 18th. We called her primary care physician and neurologist over 50 times to have them review her scan results, to no avail. When her PCP finally reviewed her brain scan, she was told ""not to worry"" and to wait for a follow up appointment that was scheduled with her neurologist on the 27th of March.    On March 20, 2020, we took her to the emergency room at ORMC due to a sudden and significant decrease in her ability to use her right arm and leg. She was unable to express herself without crying or laughing and needed the assistance of 3 people to stand up. With the information of the existing brain mass, more images were taken in the ED and our mom was admitted quickly. Within hours, she was scheduled to see a neurosurgeon. The surgeon was convinced the mass was a malignant tumor that needed to be removed or Rose's condition would get worse. Terrified of the sudden changes in her body, Rose decided to go ahead with the recommended craniotomy to find out what type of tumor was growing and how to treat it. She made it through surgery and immediate recovery very well. On March 28th, Rosemarie was officially diagnosed with a Grade 4 Glioblastoma. These are also known as GBM's, a type of brain tumor considered to be extremely aggressive, and one that currently has no cure. The treatment recommended includes both radiation and chemotherapy several times a week. We pray that this treatment will help her gain or maintain her current quality of life as well as lengthen her time with us.   At the moment, our mom is working diligently everyday within ORMC's inpatient Neuro Rehab to regain motion in her right side, as well as, regain the ability to express herself with words. Currently, she has been showing slow and steady improvement, occasionally using full sentences and expressing her needs verbally. However, the journey back to where she was prior to surgery is a long one. At the moment, Rose has no movement in her right leg or right arm. She is wheelchair bound and needs assistance with all activities of daily living: showering, toileting, dressing, and getting into bed.  As you can imagine, her medical needs are huge with pending treatments and transportation. In addition, we currently live in a town home with all showers and bedrooms upstairs. We do not have the proper equipment to meet her immediate and long-term needs once she is home. It is our hope to convert the downstairs bathroom into an ADA approved space where our mom can shower, toilet, and brush her teeth. The funding provided through this fundraiser would help us provide her with this bathroom, adjustable bed, and other supplies not covered through insurance. Rosemarie will continue to have increasing needs as her treatment progresses.We understand the enormous burden of the pandemic situation and we, ourselves, are trying our best to navigate an unimaginable situation in the middle of an impossible situation. We ask for your continued love and prayers during this time and if you cannot give now, please consider it in the future.Read more"

He has used one at Spaulding Rehab but purchasing one for home use will allow him more opportunity to use it and not have to travel to Cambridge a few times a week.An FES Bike (functional electrical stimulus) applies small electrical pulses to the paralyzed muscles to restore or improve their function. It is used to give much-needed exercise to the legs, stretching them, improving blood circulation, relaxes muscle spasms, and could lead to improved bowel and bladder function. The Standing Board will allow him to stand fully to stretch the legs and body and improve blood circulation.Danny, at age 23, was in a motorcycle accident in August of 2017, a moment in time that changed his life drastically. During the accident, he shattered vertebrae in his spine at T4 level leaving him paralyzed from mid-chest down. Danny is the most optimistic and strong person and has had nothing but the most positive attitude since hearing his diagnosis. I believe his exact words were…” There is no use getting depressed about it. That’s not going to help me get better.” The Trauma team at Tufts Medical and the staff at Spaulding had nothing but praise for Danny and credits his positive outlook and great disposition to getting him thru multiple surgeries and rehab to home in a record 3 months.Danny grew up in Methuen and has many friends and family connections to the people here. He played Pop Warner football, youth baseball, HS football, track, and baseball.Before the accident, he was working toward being a journeyman’s electrician but has since transitioned back to school to study computers in order to work towards a degree and job. He received disability but it is limited and only covers minimal living expenses and food. Jeanne, Danny's mom's job in the travel industry since COVID has been rough. She has taken a 50% cut in pay and like many others, is struggling to make all ends meet. The Miller family has been a part of the Methuen community since Kevin, Danny and Hannah started school and sports. They have always given their time and support, now is a great time to give back to a family who is in need.Being able to get this equipment for him will help keep him active and keep strengthening his body to help with life in a wheelchair.Read more"

Especially my sick grandfather. He was diagnosed with cancer for a 3rd time. This time it was more severe than he ever let any of us know. 7 years ago they cut his esophagus in half and brought the stomach up into his chest. He was after diagnosed with stomach cancer. He went through a 10 hour procedure on April 3rd, where they removed 14 inches off his colon and brought his esophagus lower, completely took out the stomach and attached the esophagus into 4 different spots. Right after surgery he was doing well. He was walking and talking. Almost on his way home.. he thought. That day he went for more tests to see if he can be on his way home and they found infections within the new connections in the esophagus,  very bad infection of pneumonia. They had to go back into the OR. Before hand he was having anxiety because the first surgery was a blessing he made it through now he has another.. they mixed his anxiety medicine with  Oxycodone  and Ativan. He was unresponsive from the time they gave him the medicine to the time the doctors came back to realize he was not just sleeping. They narcaned him to bring him back to us. It all went down hill from there... he has not been the same since. When they asked him if he knew who his wife and daughter were he shook his head no. He went into surgery and out of surgery with a heart beat but unresponsive. Since that day... going on our third week my grandfather has yet to say a word. He suffered 2 heart attacks during this time, one being right in front of my eyes. He had a collapsed lung and another infection in the abdomen. They just recently took out his breathing tube and put a trach in to minimize the bacteria. They entered more drains into his stomach to help get rid of the infection. My grandfather can no longer go under for any more surgeries so it is completely up to his body to fight this off. The doctors gave us a 50/50 chance of him making this because they can no longer predict what will work and not work. During all of this my mother and grandmother have been sleeping on couches in the ICU section at Moffit Cancer Center. Even after this long recovery the future plans are that my grandfather will be in the hospital for a while then to a rehab center and then have an in home nurse. On top of this my grandparents are both retired and all these bills are going to get super expensive. Any little bit can help my family get by during this extremely tough time.

The doctors have said that Keith has a long road ahead of him, and he will need to go to a rehab facility once he is released from the hosiptal.Going on seven weeks in ICU with no clear answers yet, the family is not losing hope. They all feel there is an enormous anchor tied to their hearts, especially with Jenn.Please pray for Keith and Jenn and keep thinking positive thoughts. I have set up this Go Fund Me account in the hopes that we can ease some of the financial burden that the Conover’s are facing. Due to the seriousness of Keiths condition, Jenn has been with him around the clock and has not been able to go into work on a regular basis. The medical and other household bills are coming in and I would love to help take some of the burden off them. If you are reading this, and can’t not afford to make a contribution, then I ask that you simply say a prayer for The Conover’s, and share this with all of your friends.Thank you for your supportCasey Midiri and the Conover FamilyRead more"

Please help raise money for treatment and surgery for Riley!

Riley is just a lover. A 5 year old chihuahua dachshund mix, he was diagnosed with IVDD—a degenerative spinal condition. It hit him really hard really quickly. One day he was playing at the beach, the next day his legs were wobbly, and a couple of days later he couldn’t walk.

Riley needs treatment and surgery to live a happy life again, and it’s really really expensive. With round the clock care and rehab, his dad Britton will be working hard to help Riley find mobility again. We need everyone’s help to save Riley!

Please help raise funds to get Riley the surgery he needs!

As many of you know, Angela, also know as ""L.A.,"" was involved in a car accident that resulted in a head on tree collision the night of January 16, 2021 around 10:30PM in Charlotte, NC. The road Angela had her accident on is extremely dark, curvy, and high risk for accidents. We are currently looking to start a Petition in the area to support with road enhancements in order to decrease the number of life-threatening accidents that take place on the road.Edit: Here’s the official petition link -linkAngela has severe injuries that include a left Pelvic fracture, a left hip socket fracture, her right knee stitched up , one metacarpal bone break in right hand, a liver laceration, two pulled vertebrae in her neck near spine (Spine and Brain are healthy and fully functioning), and shattered ribs on the right side. Yes, the injuries and the wounds are strong, BUT the God we serve is stronger. We thank you all so much for the continued prayers, kind check-ins, and heart felt messages. As she regains full strength in her body, we ask you to be patient with her. It takes a village to raise a child and Doctors say it may take three months before she can even learn to walk again, therefore, she has a long recovery ahead, so lets keep our spirits high, hope alive, and allow positive thoughts and energy to thrive.

Please help us in supporting a single mother and her two children in a time of need. Beth Barrett is a teacher in Cobb county with two small children. Her daughter Taylor (a third grader in Cobb county) was in a horrible car accident Wednesday January 18, 2017. Her dad and younger brother were in the car but are OK. Taylor had a skull fracture and had to have emergency surgery to release pressure and remove a skull fragment. Taylor was then put in PICU .By the grace of God Taylor has made it out of PICU and is now undergoing Inpatient Rehab. Beth will need to remain out of work to assist Taylor and help her regain her life back. Taylor is learning to walk again, talk again, read again, eat again, and the list continues. Beth is learning to administer medications, flush feeding lines, check vitals, and the list continues. Taylor's journey could continue for many months or even years. Please help Beth (and both of her children) during such a critical time. Any amount you are able to contribute is greatly appreciated. We also ask for continued, daily prayers. Thank you so, very much.

Whilst I've not lost any cognitive function my motor control was reduced to blinking.I'm not going to dwell on the negatives, hardly the thing for the start of a new year, but while Hannah is keeping the show on the road in the most humbling way imaginable my role has been reduced to fighting for every bit of motor function I can get back.It is a huge mountain to climb and I am still at the bottom but climbing mountains is what I do and with progress so far I am at least over the bergschrund.I also know I have benefited from a huge amount of support from the start from friends near and far. I am truly grateful and my state of mind is better for it.I have 'typed' this using a simple but slow eye tracking system. I can't promise to produce much text (some of you will say that is a good thing!) but I will try and let you know how I am getting on. Wishing you all the best for the coming year.”As Dave says himself he is at the beginning of a very long climb. Compared to where Dave was last March, where he only had eye movement, he has made huge amounts of progress. His attitude, positivity and ability to look forward is incredibly impressive for all to see. Dave now has small amounts of movement in all limbs, is doing some standing with support and is on a motorized bike. His facial paralysis and locked jaw continue to be a frustration, but he is constantly working on improving that and he is still using his eye gaze system to communicate. The decision was made by them early on that Sheffield would provide Dave with better neuro re-hab options than their hometown outside Inverness, and also provide his wife Hannah and their two boys a network to support them all while they are in Sheffield. Dave has an NHS funded place in an impressive neuro-rehab facility called STEPS and NHS Highland are funding his place on a (so far rolling) 3 monthly basis. With the progress Dave is making he is hoping this will continue for the medium term, but the funding for this is not certain.Hannah has been the most incredible wife, nurse, friend, advocate and mother you could possibly imagine. Hannah and the boys have been living in Sheffield from April until now (Jan 2019). Hannah and Dave have made the difficult decision that in February 2019 Hannah and the boys will return to Carrbridge, Scotland to return to work and to start her PhD and for the boys to return to school, their home and friends. Dave will remain in Sheffield for as much rehab as possible. Dave’s goals are to walk, eat a Sunday Dinner and bake Hannah a cake (as this all happened just before her birthday last year.) There’s a long, long, long way to go but he certainly feels that he is making small movements in that direction. As you can see from his Facebook message Dave is looking forward and upwards. His determination as we all know is out of this world. The Physios and other staff at STEPS are getting excited about his progress and attitude to his rehab. It’s going to be a long haul and continue to be a roller-coaster of a ride.A lot of folk have asked about wanting to chip in and make contributions to the Hollinger Mission. Dave and Hannah have both not felt entirely sure about this. But now they are coming up to a year on from the accident, they can both see that a sort of “trust fund” for Dave for equipment such as an off road wheelchair that could enable him to take the boys orienteering one day soon or funding for additional ongoing physio once his time at STEPS ends would be really helpful. Hannah especially wants to be VERY clear that this fund is for equipment and physio for Dave. She doesn’t want folk to think she’ll be spending it on going on holiday- as if! But they both definitely deserve a very long one! This has been written in consultation with Hannah and Dave, as I’m sure you will understand it’s a difficult thing for either of them to write themselves. If you would like to contribute please do so. Or if you feel inspired to do a sponsored climb, walk or event please even better! It would be great to hear what everyone has been getting up to and for Dave and Hannah, Finley and Toby to see which mountains Dave is inspiring others to climb!#inspiredbydave@inspiredbydave1Read more"

Our sweet Brody Bear suffered a near drowning accident after falling into his family’s backyard swimming pool. CPR was administered immediately and continued for a recorded 82 minutes in addition to 17 rounds of EPI before he regained a pulse and was able to be air lifted to a Pediatric ICU. We will forever be grateful for the quick actions and tireless efforts of all of the incredible first responders, nurses, and physicians who helped him on that day. Over the next 42 days, Brody would spend nearly 3 weeks in the ICU before being transferred to Shriners Children’s Hospital for acute inpatient rehab. The first few days were horrific. There were many conversations that no parent should ever have to have – talking about test results, organ donation, and the incredibly poor prognosis that was anticipated after his accident. He experienced intubation, sedation, and test after test that didn’t give his care team much to be hopeful for. What doctors didn’t know at the time is that Brody is an absolute miracle, and that he is the epitome of the Power of Prayer. Since Brody woke up, each day has slowly turned his friends and family’s fear and sadness into joy and gratefulness. Brody has an incredible support team, and their ONLY requests are for people to pray for him and to share his story to prevent this happening to another family. But, because Brody lives in an amazing community of people who want to help, his family has given permission to start this Go Fund Me. The next few months will be crucial to his recovery. The family is seeking treatment in Louisiana, followed by Florida, and finally Texas before being able to return home at the beginning of summer. Although many families have shared their success stories with these treatments they are not covered by insurance. Brody’s parents would travel to the earth’s end to help him continue to progress, and with our support we can ease the financial hardship that comes with the best care. Please consider donating to Brody Bear Strong’s Go-Fund me page if you are able. But above all, please find it in your heart to thank God for the healing He’s given Brody thus far, and pray for his continued healing and then SHARE this! Talk to your friends and family with pools; tell them about this story, and encourage them to make their pools safe by getting a gate or cover. Any funds that are raised above Brody’s immediate care needs or equipment needs for his future will be donated in his name to families that are also in need. This can include helping a family with medical bills or incidental expenses that come with an extended hospital stay, helping another family make their pool safe, donating to the organizations that helped save his life, and spreading awareness and encouragement for other families who endure this type of accident. In the words of his parents, “Squeeze your kids extra tight tonight. Don’t sweat the small stuff. Talk to God.

I’m here to help tell his story. The funds raised from this campaign will be used directly towards all of Javier’s funeral cost, included but not limited to funeral Home, cemetery, gravestone, and choice of clothing. Thank you all who were touched by our story and either shared, or donated. 

After 10 years, Javi’s fight is finally coming to an end. For those who don’t know, Javi was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy when he was in 7th grade. He ended up needing a heart transplant his freshman year of high school, and in November of 2011, he got his heart. But, after a few years his body rejected that organ, and at 17 he found himself needing a second heart transplant. He was in the hospital on various machines, and medications for 6 months. He received a second heart transplant on November 16th, 2014. In January 2014, he had a procedure to put in a pacemaker. Once that was done, life went on. Javi healed, he had great days, good days and he had his bad days followed by many hospital stays throughout the years. But he fought. January of 2019 our life changed right before our eyes, and we didn’t even know. Javi caught pneumonia, and quickly it spread. Within days he was intubated and had to be sedated. January 12th, 2019, he went into cardiac arrest. Took about 6-7 minutes for doctors to do different CPR methods to bring him back. Once a heartbeat was found, they immediately prepped him to be put him on a life support machine called ECMO. He was on the breathing machine and ECMO for almost 2 weeks before doctors decided he was in the clear to be without the extra support. The result of that, was that his kidneys barely functioned. So he had to be placed on dialysis, and he had a catheter placed in his chest. After that, Javi spent weeks in the hospital, in a rehab facility, then back home for a few days, maybe a few weeks until he’d be back in the hospital. He was placed on the ECMO and intubated again during one of his hospital stays. While all of this was happening, I was pregnant. Javi wanted nothing more than be a daddy to his babygirl. Come July, Javi fought his hardest to see his daughter be born, and he accomplished just that. While I was being induced, Javi was being wheeled up to my hospital room. He would get so swollen, from retaining so much fluid, that’d it’s be difficult to walk or wear regular gym shoes. But, Javi made sure he got to see the birth of his child. 4 days after our baby was born, javi checked into the hospital again and spent the next 2 and a half months there. After a few weeks, he was released into a rehab, and on October 9th, he surprised me finally at home. Life felt great, our family was finally together after a rough few months. Unfortunately that lasted about a week. Javi again, was rushed to the ER at 4 am and this time, no one was sure that he was going to make it. He was fighting a life threatening infection called sepsis. Doctors caught it early enough, but overall his kidneys, blood stream, and heart were all deteriorating. They had to cut open his thigh to scrape out some other type of infection that led to the sepsis he had, but he was so fragile, it took a few weeks to close that open wound and do a skin graft surgery. Javi’s body by this point, was tired. And couldn’t handle anything else being done to it. Doctors talked to him and told him, that he was running his course and options were very limited on what could be done if he caught another infection. After 10 years of fighting he made the decision to live out his last few day’s with the help of hospice. In our time of need, we ask for whatever help anyone can give so we can make the preparations for Javi’s departure. As a family, we are all trying to give javi the end of life celebration he deserves. We would love to be able to provide him with everything he asked for. Javi is a fighter, and beat the odds many times. He’s impacted so many peoples’ lives, and hopes to continues to do so.

We are creating this post in honor of our friend, husband, father, grandfather, and a Novi Community Business Owner for over 44 years, Jerry(Jerome) Harris. Jerry has always had a smile on his face and an infectious laugh which makes us smile. He has always been willing to give so unselfishly to many groups of people, organizations, and businesses. So now I would like to take this moment to please ask to find it in your heart to give back to Jerry and his Family.

Since November Jerry had been experiencing health issues and they were not fully diagnosed until now. In November he was hospitalized with covid, pneumonia, and a UTI, and since then his daily life has not been the same. He started experiencing multiple strokes almost daily and many hospital visits later, they discovered a brain tumor that they believe has spread throughout his body. This condition has severely disrupted his lifestyle, deeming him unfit to run the family business, (a business he truly loved) the family’s main source of income. With this loss the family will also lose all health insurance benefits in just a few short weeks. He has been suffering a significant number of falls due to loss of control of his body, and recently broke his nose, wrists, and his ankle exiting his CT scan. He now remains in the hospital but believe he will be transported to a rehab facility in the near future due to his medical conditions progressing so rapidly. If there is any way you could help out the Harris Family it would be greatly appreciated. We know time are tough, if you cannot help out financially, thoughts, prayers, and shares of their story is very much appreciated. Thank you and God BlessHarris Family, Tari Rutkowski, & Roberta

Bystanders pulled Perry from the water in an unresponsive state and he was miraculously resuscitated on site. The quick actions of those civilians on the beach that day were entirely instrumental in keeping Perry alive as they offered their medical expertise. Incredibly, Perry survived with no brain damage, because of the effective CPR performed on the spot. It was discovered Perry had sustained fractures to the C6 vertebrae in his neck and that evening he was airlifted to Prince of Wales hospital in Sydney to undergo emergency surgery to stabilise the fractures the following morning. Due to the serious nature of his spinal injury it is not yet clear the level to which Perry will regain movement and sensation in his body. Perry will remain in Sydney for the next 6 months undergoing an intensive rehab and therapy program at the POW Spinal Unit. The goal is for Perry to gain back as much movement possible during this very crucial period after a spinal injury, with Phillipa to stay by his side throughout this journey.Your donation will support Perry, Phillipa and their beautiful family today, and into the future. Phillipa is expecting to give birth to their third child during this time of displacement while their eldest daughter is due to start kindergarten this year. Their needs will have long term and ongoing logistical and financial implications, currently the family faces accommodation costs in Sydney, travel and food expenses, pregnancy related care - all the while, maintaining bills and mortgage repayments in their home town of Wagga.There will be extensive costs, many of these unknown at this point, which will be required to support Perry and his family adjusting to a new way of life. The level of home modifications that will need to occur has not been fully established, it is anticipated that Phillipa and Perry will need to undertake significant renovations to their family home and additionally purchase a car suitable to their needs. Our hopes and prayers are that Perry would be able to regain the independent lifestyle which he loves.This 'GoFundMe page' has been set up to provide a practical way for friends, family, community and church family who wish to to care for Perry, Phillipa and their dear young family during this tumultuous time in their lives. Current COVID-19 restrictions have added further challenges and limitations for many wishing to help, many are feeling the effects of social distance barriers in helping Perry and Phillipa at this time.Donating today is a fast and effective way that we can begin supporting this dear family right now. While there is no expectation from Perry and Phillipa to give, we know that the culmination of each offering, no matter how small, will be felt tangibly as a gesture of love. While we cannot change their circumstances, we can start to provide ease of mind and an element of practical support as they focus on the recovery and rehab process.There is a long road ahead for this young family in the recovery process but we will continue to surround them with our loving support, prayers, and practical financial resources.Please keep them in your thoughts and come back to visit their page, to read new updates and donate if you are able. Thank you in advance for your kind support and well wishes.* If you have trade skills/labouring time to offer/donate or if you/your business have items to donate for the potential renovations or perhaps items to be used for future fund-raising events please contact us to be added to our database of contacts.Read more"

He rode down a hill on a longboard skateboard without a helmet. His luck ran short that night and he fell and struck his head on the pavement. This was a life-threatening accident. The phone calls and emergency room conversations that followed, were more than any parent and family should ever have to go through. Dylan had two emergency brain surgeries within two days, removing his skull from both sides of his head that would allow his brain to swell. Over the next 3 weeks, Dylan had numerous procedures and an incredible amount of medication as they stabilized his cranial pressure, dealt with spasms in the brain, and managed a condition known as “storming”.During that time, due to COVID-19 restrictions only our parents, Cindy and Paul, were allowed in to see him, so they took 12-hour shifts, 7 days a week to make sure he was never without a loved one. To this day, these same long shifts continue. Only through the incredible support of family and friends, was that even made possible. During the fourth week, the swelling, spasms, and storming, finally began to subside. Medications were being reduced and the conversation became closer to discussing recovery, which will likely involve transferring Dylan to a facility almost 100 miles away from home. With all of that being said we have decided to start this fundraiser to begin to help with relieving the cost of recent, current and future medical procedures, treatments, and rehab expenses. We are aiming for an initial goal of $50,000, but will adjust our goals based on Dylan’s ongoing needs and care. We appreciate any help that you are willing and able to give, especially during these uncertain times. We also want to thank all of our loved ones, friends, family, and even complete strangers that have already done so much for our family. We would not be able to have our complete focus on Dylan and getting him better without everyone around us, may God bless you all.Read more"

He is currently heavily sedated and they are keeping his body temperature low to hopefully minimize brain damage. The next 36 hours are the most critical. On Saturday, the doctors will begin to ween him off the sedation and life support measures. Right now, the doctors are telling us he has a 5% chance of coming out of this and they said if, by the grace of God, he comes out of this he will have significant medical issues and will require extensive rehab.
The impact to the family is immense because Doug is the screws and bolts that holds his family together. He is Jamie's rock and true partner. Doug is in God's very capable hands now and through God all things are possible. We are all praying for Doug and whatever God's will may be.

Our daughter, Nora Decker,age 12, needed a complicated spinal surgery to repair a congenital defect that connected the skullto the spine. In order to meet this goal, pins, screws, rods and a metal plate with a skin graft wereused to make the cervical spine stable. The surgery was successful, and they were able to makethe connection. The surgery was to last 7-9 hours, however, at the end of the surgery, thingsturned for the worst. There was a complication that happened from a judgement made withanesthesia. Now that a week has past, we wanted to share what’s happening.We had to be at the Hackensack Meridian Hospital by 7 am for a 9:00 am start. So, my wife,son, daughter and myself were up before 5am to make sure we got there on time. A discussionwith Anesthesia occurred to discuss my daughter’s extensive history and concerns. Mydaughter’s surgery went very well in the operating room until they took her off of anesthesiaaround 4:30pm. She woke up and was fighting with the Endotracheal tube, so theanesthesiologist made a judgment to extubate her by pulling the air tube out. Our daughter hasextensive medical history, including asthma and sleep Apnea. With her history being involved itmakes her very high risk. The moment he removed the tube everything turned for the worse.She had a bronchial spasm and her air way closed completely. The anesthesiologist could notget the tube back down her throat and she went for 20 min without getting any air to her brain.They were trying, but her stats went into the single digit’s multiple times throughout the 20 minand her lungs started to fill with fluid. They had to put a trach in her throat and had to performCPR on her two times because her heart stopped. From there they had to bag her to make sureshe kept breathing She was put on a ventilator and given nitrous oxide so her stats would comeback up. When the doctors came out to talk to us, they were not sure if she was going to make itthrough the night. This is the worst feeling a parent can feel. Last rites and reconciliation weregiven by a priest.At this point they wanted to put her on a full breathing machine called Ecmo to replicate herlungs so her lungs and heart could start to heal but Hackensack does not have this machine forpediatrics patients. Her pupils were also not dilating with light and this is a huge concern for herbrain. It was 12 am and we needed to transfer her to a hospital that had this machine. One optionwas Columbia Children’s Hospital in NYC., but they did not have a bed, so they decided totransport her to NYU Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital affiliated with New York Langone. Thetransport didn’t get there from NYU Langone until 3:30 AM and we didn’t leave Hackensackuntil 6am Thursday. She arrived to NYU Langone a little before 7 with my wife and I showingup at 7am and finally in her room to see her at 8am. NYU used Thursday to learn about her andsee how she reacted to pulling back some of her meds which was 9 IV’s for different things. Herpupils started to dilate with light at around 11 pm. Thursday night, they brought her for a catscan which came back normal. She has also moved her hands ever so slightly along with herlegs once or twice. On Friday, they put something in her nose and her face grimaced a bitbecause she didn’t like it. This doesn’t sound like much but without full testing at least I knowher brain told her that something was in her nose and her face changed because she didn’t like it.This is all still very slow steps with her still sedated but it shows reaction to stimulation.We are hoping to find out more information about her brain, heart and lungs in the comingdays, but it’s been an extremely long week. Both my wife and I did not get to sleep until wewere up for 42 hours from the initial surgery start time and are days have been devastating,exhausting with lots of up’s/down’s.With this tragic event we must figure out a new normal for right now with my son needing togo to school along with my wife who’s not leaving the hospital and myself going back and forth.Our family is broken, and we want our family to feel whole again.Changes are being made with medications and tests are being done for the her heart, lungsand brain. We have been informed that this is a long recovery with deficits that either canimprove or be permanent. Some of the issues found were that her lungs and heart are notfunctioning normally and need to heal. Her blood pressures have been running high and she has asevere infection in her lungs and blood clots in her extremities. She remains in a sedatedcondition because she’s on a ventilator and neurologically limited. An MRI is being performedto determine the area of damage to her brain. Nora seems to improve moving one step forwardand then one step back making it difficult for doctors to diagnose her damages. This tragic eventeffected our family, finances, jobs, and a girl that went to middle school with A’s in her classes.She loved ART and Dance. We can’t process how were going to manage on this long journeygoing forward.UPDATE AS OF NOVEMBER 14, 2019:Nora had her MRI of Brain and unfortunately we received more devastating news. The brain received multiple areas of damage. However, until the swelling goes down and another MRI is performed we wont know what areas of brain are permanent damage and which can be improved with rehab. The doctor stated she will not be what she completely was. We are feeling helpless and broken as a family. Please continue your prayers and thoughtful support. We are very thankful and appreciative of all your generosity. We don’t know how were going to manage this journey.......UPDATE AS OF NOVEMBER 17, 2019:I just wanted to update everyone that Nora’s Lungs are improving but her left lung is still alittle diminished. Her Heart has been improving on her echocardiograms. Nora was able to start tube feedings and she is tolerating her goal amount. She is scheduled to have a procedure on Wednesday in the OR for change the Trach because Hackensack Hospital put the wrong one in. They put an adult trach instead of a pediatric. They also want to make sure that they didn’t displace or fracture anything. They are trying to wean her off her pain medication but Nora is so sensitive and withdrawing. She was having tremors and moving all her extremities and agitated. They are working on it. My number #1 goal is to get Nora off the ventilator. However, the weaning process is slow. So Sunday November 17 she was given a trail to breath on her own and she was monitored to see if her respirations were ok and if her oxygen dropped. Nora was able to go 3 hours with having good respirations, O2 and volume. She did get tired and they had to put her back on the vent to rest. Please continue to pray for Nora. We need more improvements.UPDATE AS OF NOVEMBER 24, 2019:The medical support team is weaning Nora off of her pain medication morphine.  She is doing well but having withdrawal like symptoms. They are trying to lower her dose every couple days. They tried spacing her, but she had trouble going more than 3 hours. She is still sleepy at times, and her brain needs more healing. This is normal at this time. She has been sprinting with breathing. Which means they have her breathing on her own with pressure support. Almost like Bipap/C-pap. She was able to go 10 hours on Saturday and for today they want her to go as long as she can handle and then they will put her back on the Ventilator. Nora Is moving her legs and arms with agitation. Nora also sat up today for the first time for 12 minutes. We are so appreciative of the support from everyone, the school system, the Old Bridge PTA, Meridian Health center at Raritan Bay, our family and friends and yes even those anonymous people.UPDATE AS OF NOVEMBER 28, 2019:Today is Thanksgiving Day and this day has not been our usual, we were saddened. We are thankful to have Nora with us today as we didn’t know if she was going to make it a few weeks ago. We were all together today and ended our get together with our family tradition of a family hug. Some things that changed over the last few days were that Nora is off the Vent. She is breathing on a trach collar with supplemental oxygen. Nora is getting Out Of Bed assistance by physical therapy to the chair each day and has increased the length of time in the chair each day. Nora is now able to sit up for 3 ½ hours. Nora struggles with agitation, temperatures and withdrawal from her morphine wean. They have switched her morphine to methadone and seems to be doing a little better. Nora is still opening her eyes and moving her legs. Hopefully soon she’ll be off the narcotics for a better idea of the deficits we need to work on. Thank you everyone for helping us through this time. All the support means so much to us! Please keep with prayers coming.......UPDATE AS OF DECEMBER 10, 2019:Hi everyone. I just wanted to update everyone. Our days have been tiring and each day blends into one another. As of right now, Nora has been breathing on her own with a HME cap over the trach. They did a scope yesterday on Monday 12/9 and her trach is better then previous scope but still is reddened and has some white patches. Her tongue is showing white patches also. Her upper Airway through her nose was difficult to view due to a lot of secretions. Therefore, the suspect fungal infection and sent a sputum culture#3. It is growing something, but the culture is not complete yet. They started her on a fungal antibiotic and broad-spectrum antibiotic now. We will see when results come back. Nora will still nee a sleep study as she dips in oxygen at night to 88,89 but goes back to 92. They are checking for central sleep apnea. She is having her G-tube placed today and may possibly need the vent when she comes back until anesthesia wears off but not sure I will keep everyone updated. We need to get her back on lovenox for anticoagulation after procedure and then continue the weaning schedule of methadone. We need to have a family meeting with neurology before we go to rehab. If anyone was wondering, we plan on going to children specialized in New Brunswick. Please continue to pray for Nora. We need as many prayers as we can get because we feel helpless and not in control. We love everyone and appreciate everyone for their support.UPDATE AS OF DECEMBER 25th,2019:Hi everyone, on December 25th, Nora was moved to children’s specialized hospital in New Brunswick. It is a rehab facility to help her with her cognitive, mobility, motor, speech and any other deficits. It is quite different from the hospital. Nora started crying the next day. She was becoming sensitive to her environment and sounds. We were thinking it was because of change of place and she didn’t know what was happening. Over the next couple days, we were having issues with her heart rate being high and breathing fast. Her therapies were being effected and they weren’t able to really work with her. It was increasing and on Christmas day, her heart rate was at its highest 160-170. They sent her to RobertWood Johnson ER for evaluation. After the workup, she did not have any infection. No pulmonary embolism. Nora was having “sympathetic brain storming “. Sympathetic storming means repeated episodes where the body seems to go completely out of control. Her heart rate was fluctuating at very high levels, Sweating and breathing fast. Nora was placed in PICU and started on clonidine to help with the storming effects. We are planning on going back to children’s specialized hospital for rehab Monday. Please continue to pray for Nora to get better and heal. We need prayers to get through each day. We appreciate everyone and grateful. xoxoUPDATE AS OF JANUARY 17th, 2020:Good evening everyone, Sorry if it’s been a little while since I last updated. My days are consumed with Nora’s therapy schedule and then my family comes to visit at night. By the time Nora is settled in bed I am sleepy also. My goal is to try to update every 2 weeks unless there is substantial improvement. With a brain injury, things can be slow and repetitive. After Nora’s visit to Robertwood Johnson Hospital we were able to get back to Rehab for Round#2. Since then things have been less stressful since her Heart Rate has not been elevated. Nora was having a difficult time with her nighttime routine and she was having trouble staying asleep. She was waking up every time they repositioned her or changed her diaper. She woke up every time we suctioned her too. Sleeping for me was very difficult and broken at this time. However, Nora has been able to get used to some things over these couple weeks and she is going back sleep when we change her or do things. Nora has been getting PT, OT, Speech and recreational therapy. She has been responding with local and generalized responses. She has also tracked objects of interest (example Hannah Monatana, Music, therapy dog). The objects that she follows are specific. She has also answered Yes & No questions by moving the muscles that are used to say Yes and No. Her muscles are weak so its difficult to see but the therapists feel her muscles moving by holding her neck and they feel her muscles move. Recently Nora has had Casts placed on her legs and every week they will take them off and measure and keep increasing flexion to get her foot back to normal. Her right foot will need 6 weeks and left foot 4weeks. After this process she will need braces for legs. Nora has also been using a stander 2 times a day and gets in the Chair. During Speech, she has been working on swallowing and wearing a speaking valve most of the day. Nora’s cough has gotten stronger and her muscles are getting stronger too. We are grateful that everyone is still thinking of Nora and praying. I believe that with everyone praying and hoping that she will keep improving. I enjoy everyone checking in on us and being supportive. It helps me stay on the positive path. Xoxo Love everyoneUPDATE JANUARY 28th, 2020:Unfortunately, this update is not the easiest to write. Literally after I wrote the previous update, Nora went back to Robert Wood Johnson Hospital the next day. She was having heavy breathing and her breathing rate was in the high 30s to 40s. We tried everything and unable to get her rate to come down. We did xrays, blood gases, tylenol, albuterol treatment, started steroids, and changed her trach. That being said she was sent to the ER on Tuesday 1/14/20 and they were going to treat her for Pneumonia. Her rate did become better. Instead of 38 it was 28-30. It did get better, but it was brought to my attention that her x-ray showed atelectasis on the left and they looked at the cat scan from her previous transfer to the ICU. They told me she had narrowing of the left mainstem bronchus. I was never told this till now. I called her pulmonologist in NYU and had him speak with the pulmonologist here. A bronchoscopy was scheduled and done. Results were concluded that there is narrowing on the left and she has been compensating on her right lung and just got tired. They put her in the PICU and placed her on CPAP. This transferred to BIPAP because she had a leak around her Trach. All in all, she was unable to come off without her breathing heavy again. Further investigation was done to see if we could transfer her to another facility (CHOP, BOSTON, COLUMBIA, JOHN HOPKINS, CINCINATI, RWJ) for a balloon procedure and stent. However, we ran into some problems. We found out that Nora’s narrowing is in an area that is being compressed by her spine and the aorta and pulmonary artery. Therefore, she is not a candidate for stent. The only solution we have is to do another spine surgery to create less compression. This surgery is tentative for this Friday January 31 2020. I will update everyone as we go. Please pray for Nora to give her strength for another surgery and that we can get out of this dark tunnel of events so we can move on and get home. Words can’t even explain how our family feels. We just want to be home with everyone again. Thankyou everyone for your support and prayers. XOXOUPDATE FEBRUARY12th, 2020:Every post seems so difficult to write. Our journey seems exhausting and never ending. Anyways, Nora had her surgery and it went well. Her doctor seemed very happy with the space that was created. She did develop a Pneumothorax and needed and chest tube but after a week it was out. The doctor had to cut 6 ribs on each side to create movement of the spine. Nora started developing fevers about a few days after surgery. They found out it was a urine infection and another sputum infection. Therefore, antibiotics were started again. A Bronchoscopy was done a week after surgery and then a Cat scan was done. It concluded that Nora is having Malacia in both lungs. Malacia is just weakness in the lower airway. So, she has a hard time keeping them opening. They increased her CPAP settings to 10 but kept her pressure to 5. We are working on sprinting trials to get her off the Pressure 3x a day. We will do another x-ray this Friday. Every week they are going to change her trach in hope to reduce the amount of infections. They will culture after the change and then they will do another Bronchoscopy on Tuesday. We are lost for words but please keep praying and checking in with us. The support is helpful. Xoxo love everyone.UPDATE AS OF MARCH 28th, 2020Hi Everyone,Its been very long since my last update and I’m sorry. I have just not had the energy to write an update. Maybe I procrastinate cause the progress is slow and upsetting. However, We finally made it back to rehab for are 3rd attempt on March 3,2020. So far were doing good. From a respiratory standpoint, we have been improving a lot. Nora has been off the vent during the day going 12 hours with just an HME and room air. If anyone forgot what an HME is, its a heat moisture exchanger that provides tracheostomy humidification. They maintain thin secretions and prevent mucus plugs. At night she goes on bi pap till the morning. We went to the Pulmonologist and she was very happy with Nora’s progress. A x-ray was done and she said it looks good. She can start seeing the left diaphragm so that’s good. We now can extend the trach changes from 1x a week to every other week.From a speech perspective, she is improving her swallowing and we are trying to get her to manage her own secretions. Her swallowing is getting faster but still delayed and needs more time. She doesn’t swallow completely. They have been doing the speaking valve for about 2 hours each day. One day she went 5 hours. As for PT/OT/Cognitive Nora’s Progress has been inconsistent. She has good days and bad. She has followed commands of moving her leg or arm slightly. She has also closed her eyes and answered some yes, no questions by moving her head down for yes and turning her eyes for no. However, Nora doesn’t always follow commands when asked. She gets distracted or overwhelmed with sensory stimulation. Sometimes she is just tired. We just started doing E-stimulation to her legs and arms. Hopefully that will bring more awareness from brain to extremity. I will update you how things go. We are not sure when our discharge will be because with the coronavirus the Outpatient facilities are closed. We will maximize our rehab benefits to get therapy for Nora until the places open up. In general, we have good days and bad. As a reminder it’s a long road of unknowing what Nora will and won’t do. Sometimes things look so confusing and we don’t know if she just startling herself. Her Dr is very close in starting Amantadine to hopefully work with the neurotransmitters. We just need to come down a little more on her clonidine.Everyday Nora gets PT and OT for an hour.

At this time, much is unknown about what services, facilities, out of state move(s) and obligations they are facing. As total costs are unknown, basic TBI rehab could reach upward of $2000.00 a day ($112,000 or more) for a minimum of 8 weeks. This does not include family expenses, such as hotel, food, travel, etc. Will you join us in making a contribution to help ease the financial stress? Any contribution would be greatly appreciated.

This is my daughter Carly who just turned 25. Three weeks ago she presented with symptoms of a heart attack which landed her to the ER. When she arrived something started happening to her eye and her smile. After multiple tests the released her with a diagnosis of Bells Palsy. The next day she saw a neurologist who wanted to run more tests but needed to wait for insurance to approve. She went home again only to find herself in severe back pain that radiated down her left arm. She called the neurologist again and he sent her back to the ER. On her way there her face dropped and her right side went numb. With more tests and no answers they admitted her into hospital. The next day she lost the use of her right side. For a couple days of more tests their only answer was she had symptoms of a stroke without actually having a typical stroke which was said to have been brought on by stress.

Before she left her eye returned to normal, her smile slightly crooked and no use of her right arm and leg. They wanted her to go into rehab but with Covid and isolation rules she didn’t feel this was her best option because her depression was already at an all time high. She is now home with with a visiting nurse and 3 different types of rehab, and psychology nurse. Prior to this she was working at an elder care facility caring for people who had to be isolated to stay safe and healthy for the past 9 months and prior worked as a teller at local bank. She is still under my HSA insurance and has some thru her work but she was denied FMLA and the Jerry’s Foot steps grant which denied her paid plan to pay bills and extra medical expenses. Obviously she can’t return to work anytime soon and without FMLA, chances of her job waiting for her are slim along with her medical insurance thru them. She lives on her own with her 2 dogs and 2 cats that she rescued and took in as their forever home and considers them family as most of us do, and is still on lease there. We are filing for temporary disability but we all know how long that takes and even if she’s approved, how little they give you. We are helping her physically and with expenses but they are growing daily. Friends have brought food and gift cards to help and we are beyond grateful for their love prayers and help! At this time with the growing expenses we asking for help so that she can remain in her own home. The ability to hang on to any prior normal will aid the healing process and direct the therapies toward total independence. At this time due to growing expenses we are asking for help with bills, food and any more medical expenses that may come up.

Being the closest to the point of impact, Chloe suffered the most severe injuries of the three, and was life flighted to UPMC Altoona to assess her injuries. At that time, it was determined that Chloe had a broken femur, two collapsed lungs, multiple broken ribs, fractured vertebrae, a lacerated spleen, a large gluteal hematoma and a possible traumatic brain injury (TBI). Early Friday morning her lungs failed, and she was life flighted again - this time to UPMC Presbyterian, in Pittsburgh, so she could be hooked up to an ECMO machine (a bypass, which pumped and oxygenated her blood outside her body), allowing her lungs to rest and heal.After 4 days, Chloe no longer required ECMO, and is now on a ventilator only, intended to help transition her lungs back in to doing the work. Taking her off ECMO came with complications; she has developed a blood clot in her leg, and is currently battling low grade pneumonia and a fever. Because of the intubation, Chloe has not been able to speak or eat, so she’s been communicating by spelling and gesturing and they’ve been providing nutrition through a tube from her nose to her stomach. Once she is breathing totally on her own, there will be further assessment to look at swallowing function and overall communication abilities.Chloe has already had two surgeries (one exploratory and one to remove her spleen) and will need a third surgery, to repair her femur. The rib and vertebrae fractures will not require surgery, but will take time to heal.Throughout this last week, Chloe has shown tremendous strength, and has surprised many people, including the medical staff, with her progress so far - she is proving every second how resilient and tenacious she is. However, she still has a very long journey to recovery ahead of her. Chloe has always had a passion for helping others. She is a rising Junior at Penn State, majoring in Speech Language Pathology. She plans to one day work with people who have had strokes or traumatic brain injuries, to help them regain their ability to communicate, think and swallow. She loves to work out and spend time with her dogs Effie and Ella.This tragedy has been made even more difficult for her parents Kelly and Dave, as in the midst of COVID, only one parent is permitted in the hospital with Chloe for the remainder of her stay. The road ahead is full of obstacles, and we’d like them to be able to focus all of their energy on Chloe and her healing and recovery. This fundraiser is designed to help relieve the cost of recent, current and future medical procedures, treatments, and rehab expenses. We are aiming for an initial goal of $50,000, but will adjust our goals based on Chloe’s ongoing need.

On November 9, 2020, Stacy entered Kennestone Hospital to have a brain tumor removed. She was expected to be in the hospital for 4-5 days. After surgery, she had a major stroke which caused severe deficits on the right side of her body. She had surgery again that night to reduce swelling and another on Christmas Day to clean out infection that had developed. She ended up spending 75 days at Kennestone. We were fortunate enough to get her in to Shepherd Center. However, insurance is still denying coverage for her stay there. We had to pay half of the cost of a 6 week stay to go ahead and get her moved. We were unsuccessful with an appeal the to Insurance Commissioner’s Office to get Anthem to pay their share.

By the time she gets home (March 4th is our target date), she will have spent over 16 weeks in the hospital and rehab. She will have several weeks of outpatient therapy at Shepherd when she is released. She is also expected to have another surgery to put a plate in her head to replace the piece of skull they had to remove.

There is much work still to be done. And it is not cheap! Please help as you can to help us get her what she needs! You have already been so gracious and kind! Thank you for all you have and will continue to do.

Stacy is a fighter and she has come long way! We look forward to seeing what God will do in and through her life! Please continue to keep her in your prayers!

My name is Natalie and I’m creating this to try and help my girl Olivia as much as possible. Olivia and I met in December 2019, days before she gave birth to her second daughter, Hailey. She had just gone through rehab and was ready to be the mom she knew she could be. Rather quickly, it became obvious that Olivia and I had a connection. Our friendship started out with me being a mentor type but over the last year, has become one that I will cherish for life.



When Olivia decided to baptize Hailey, she asked me to be her Godmother and I was beyond honored to accept. And then when Olivia decided to baptize her oldest daughter McKenzie, she asked me again! What a blessing to be a Godmomma to these two amazing girls!! Olivia, Hailey and McKenzie are family, to say the least!





Olivia has been clean and sober since December 12, 2019!!! What an amazing accomplishment!!! She has been working so hard, for over ayear, to be independent and self-sufficient. She is an amazing mother and friend!! As we all know, being a single mom has its own category of struggles and every step of the way, Olivia has figured it out. This time, it’s going to be a little more difficult. Here is the part where I explain why I’m publicly asking for any help possible.This morning, (2/8/21) Olivia was laid off at her job in Peculiar. It’s a blow that no one wants to experience but sometimes things happen. Thankfully, she already had an interview for a different job, one that would potentially pay better and have better hours. On her way to the interview, in this winter weather and terrible road conditions, she found herself having to make a split decision to prevent a collision with multiple vehicles and ended up rolling her van 3 times. Thank God her daughters were at daycare and not in the car!!Olivia hit her head pretty bad and will have some bruising but overall, things could have been SO MUCH worse. We are thanking God for her life today. She will inevitably have some medical bills but that’s not what I’m asking for now. Right now she has some immediate needs to pay her bills. She’s found herself without a job or a working car in a 10 hour period of time. How devastating!?! She has bills due this month and I’m hoping to help her with some March bills as well. This will give her some time to recover, find a job and figure out the car situation.Honestly, any amount will help!!



I ask for your consideration in contributing to this wonderful, young, single mom. If you truly can’t donate, I obviously understand!! No pressure at all! I would only ask for your prayers!! I know God is in control and will provide for her needs, so let’s see what God is gonna do!



Thanks for your time, donations and prayers!!!

Brian was shot in the femoral artery and underwent emergency surgery. After 5 surgeries, a vein transplant and multiple blood transfusions, thankfully he survived. Brian spent the next 6 months in rehab learning to walk and trying to regain strength and mobility. Brian’s goal was to be able to return to duty doing what he loves, being a police officer. About 7 months later, he was back on duty. Unfortunately, the severe trauma to his body has caused permanent damage and caused other health issues. In May of last year, Brian went to the hospital fearing he was having a heart attack. He was admitted back into the hospital and diagnosed with kidney failure. Brian spent several weeks in the hospital and was started on dialysis. Soon after, he underwent a surgical procedure on his heart, as well as having a dialysis port put in. Brian receives dialysis a few times a week, which leave him exhausted and take a toll on his quality of life. Now doctors say a kidney transplant is necessary for his survival.Brian and his family really need our support. Unfortunately, Brian’s hope for a new life comes at a very high price. Brian will be unable to work during this time, which also means he’ll be without a paycheck to provide for his basic necessities.The average kidney transplant costs approximately $442,000. Even with health insurance, which will cover a portion of the transplant costs, he faces significant expenses related to the surgery. For the rest of his life, he will need follow-up care and daily anti-rejection medications. Post-transplant medications are very expensive, and they’re as critical to his survival as the transplant itself.If you’re interested in being tested as a kidney donor for Brian, or would like to send cards or other donations, please send us an email and we’ll provide you with the address.Facebook page: WWW.FACEBOOK.COM/GROUPS/OFFICERSOUTHERLANDTEAMTHANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING OFFICER SOUTHERLAND!!You can also donate by visiting The National Foundation for Transplants. www.transplants.orgTo make a secure online donation, click “Find a Patient” to search for Brian Southerland.

As you may know, in the last year Rob has been living at a rehab hospital in New Bedford, MA. Insurance has decided to stop paying for him to be there. Medicaid has not been approved, however, Medicare has picked up a few odds and ends for his stay there. Rob still has outstanding medical bills in the thousands of dollars while he waits for his Medicaid coverage and this treatment is not covered by insurance. Here are a few updates on his progression from this devil of a disease: We are delighted that Rob can now communicate better with the help of technology donated to him, but his speech is slurred now and it’s hard to communicate the “old-fashioned way”. Hard is an understatement. He now types with his eyes, yes, his eyes. Rob loves going outside in the sun when he can, in his wheel chair. Most people ask what he can do now. We say he can’t do too much. He can’t walk, he can’t move his arms, legs, fingers, hug or squeeze his kids, and the list goes on. What we say he CAN do is still joke and laugh. For that, we are happy. Each smile he gives is an indication that he, too, has hope for the future and for this treatment.                        Read more"

Hello everyone!!

Many of you know my dog Buddha, and some of you know he tore his ACL a couple months ago. During this time we have tried to rehab it back with meds and physical therapy exercise it doesn’t seem to be working. Because of this, we are going to need to get the surgery. While I normally wouldn’t be the one to ask for help, the pandemic has kept me unemployed and therefor unable to pay for his surgery. I would love to be able to get it soon, we’ve already waited a while and I would love to get him out of pain ASAP and onto the healing path so he can run on the beach again with his friends! Thank you guys so much for even looking at this, any amount would help. ❤️

We hope everyone is staying safe. Sending all of our love,Lauren and Buddha.

His fight to survive continued on the beach waiting for medical treatment. The ambulance was unable to make it down the rocky trail to get to him. With the help of his wife, Bonita, and good friends with a jeep they were able to carry him from the shore and endure a harrowing 40-minute drive to the waiting ambulance. Sal was admitted to the CMC hospital in Cozumel in critical condition. The following day, a highly experienced orthopedic spine surgeon performed an incredibly complicated procedure to clean out bone fragments and fuse his damaged vertebrae. During the operation, the surgeon found that most of Sal’s nerves were severed during the accident. The pressure on his spinal cord from the damaged vertebrae has caused paralysis from the neck down. Despite the grim prognosis, Sal is full of positivity and hope. He has faced many obstacles in life and has persevered. Sal has a larger-than-life personality and an enviable passion for living despite his paralysis. He has remained conscious and alert throughout this ordeal and although vented through a tracheotomy, he is able to move his lips to communicate with his family and the medical staff.It will be a very long and difficult road to recovery for Sal. We know that he will fight with all he has to get stronger every day. However, Sal will need extensive rehab and hospital care. The house he shares with his wife in Cozumel will need to be altered, and he will need round-the-clock care. It is possible they may need to find a more adequate home for his specific needs. All these things will cost money immediately and ongoing.We have established this fund to help pay for medical expenses. Noone wants to ask their family and friends for financial support, but no one could ever plan for the expense of a devastating accident like this. Despite having medical insurance in Mexico, covering Sal’s current and future ongoing medical expenses, after insurance, will be a burden. The massive hospital bill and the expenses for his ongoing care will only further add to this debt.To our friends, family, friends of friends, to anyone in general who has compassion for our family’s situation, we ask for your help. Even a $5 donation will help ease the strain of this tragic situation. Sal lives life with a true passion for everything he does. He is a man with compassion and empathy for everyone he meets. We ask now that you please show Sal the same compassion.Thank you all for your continued prayers, please keep them coming. The power of prayer and Sal’s unwavering spirit will guide him on this journey.

She’s been my best friend since 10 years old and she is the most courageous person I know and has never let her accident that left her paralyzed keep her down. So, this surgery won’t keep her down either. Here is her situation in her own words. Please consider helping my friend- the 40k will only cover the required CNA she will have to have post surgery and there will be other expenses associated (van, electric chair) that insurance may not cover.FROM LARISSA: I have a severe tear in my left rotator cuff and tendon/muscle are detached from the bone. I was referred to a shoulder specialist connected with Shepherd Spinal Center. This surgery will leave me without a working limb and trunk control is minimal. I never realized how much I use my arms for balance until pretending to have the left arm in a sling. Before the new year, the plan was to have surgery and a 3 night hospital stay followed by two-three weeks rehab and then skilled nursing facility which I have learned is a nicer way of saying nursing home. We spent 3 days this week at Shepherd Spinal Center learning how to use Hoyer Lift, bathroom options, positioning in bed, ordering a power chair and more. For weeks I will be completely dependent on someone for care, even to be fed. This has been so difficult to deal with. It has taken me back to 1980 and all the feelings I thought I had forgotten or shoved away, have resurfaced with panic attacks at night. Moving with the shoulder pain can be terribly painful so I have the feeling of being stuck. It helps to have Jeff help me up and just move around the room or my house when this happens.On Wednesday I found out that insurance will send me home after surgery. I will have to be placed in and out of the car with a Hoyer Lift and Jeff hasn’t been cleared to lift, bend or twist from his lumbar fusion. The doctor will not release me to a nursing home because he feels they will tear my shoulder. We were hoping Shepherd would accept me to heal and start rehab when possible but criterion for insurance is 3 hours of rehab a day which Shepherd can not provide because of the need to heal before rehabbing the rotator cuff. I need an exit plan to even have surgery. That means a family member who is trained and family/friends and hired care givers to attend me for 12 weeks. It is absurd to think insurance expects a C-5/6 quad to come home without a working limb. I can not even imagine the inability to move without the aid of someone. I know I was there 38 years ago, but I was very sick and so young. It is different, but the same in so many ways. This is deeply personal and not something I wanted to put on Facebook, but it’s the easiest way to update friends and also ask for resources. If anyone in the Newnan area knows any CNA’s, please let me know. If you are a Medicare/Tricare For Life expert, I need your help. Thank you for your calls, texts and messages. I am always thankful for my family and the best friends that are way above and beyond friendship. You are family and I treasure every one of you.Read more"

So many have commented on the help Billy has given them through their careers. Although we surpassed our initial goal, I'm hoping that, as a community, we can reach double the goal. So I ask all of you - if you've not yet done so, use this moment to honor a very unique and wonderful human being.To keep up with Billy's progress, go to https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/billymallon.

After a prolonged period in intensive care, he is now in acute rehab in New York. The extent to which he will be able to recover is unknown at this time, but we want to have this guy back:Billy Mallon comments on a loving relationship:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn56u-by-D0After discussions with his partner, Jan Shoenberger, Rick Bukata, and Mel Herbert, we decided to create this GoFundMe page. Billy will need a medical air transport back to his home in LA, where he will continue rehab as all of us hope for a substantial recovery. Such flights cost about $35,000. His home will have to be substantially modified to accommodate his needs, and there will be an ongoing need for aides.He is not the sort to ask for help, but there are so many of us who want to help him anyway. He has enough to deal with without being faced with a mounting financial burden. I am asking all of his friends and supporters to donate to this cause. I am asking for donations no more than $100 per person.For any funds NOT going directly to Billy, his wish is that funds be donated to the nonprofit fund dedicated to enhancing global emergency care.

She is a devoted mom of two (one boy & one girl), a beloved wife, and the best friend you could ask for. China is creative, passionate, free-spirited and loyal - she loves with her whole heart. Living in Las Vegas her life revolved around her family and friends until her story changed a year and a half ago... Like most of us, China had a mole on her body and didn't like it so she went to the doctor to get it removed back in 2019. That decision changed her and her families lives forever. She had it removed and per protocol, the mole was sent to pathology. Never in a million years, did she think anything of it - the results came back melanoma and she underwent a massive surgery to remove the cancer they discovered. And, that started #TeamSmiths fight against this aggressive form of cancer.Fast Forward to 2020, the melanoma had spread. and China was diagnosed with Stage 4 Melanoma. China is strong and took it on, doing her best to keep life normal for her children even serving as class mom at school as she underwent rigorous treatment. China kept fighting and for a bit, we thought she was winning - in the beginning off the spring of 2020 she was even technically in remission! WOW, way to go China!!! But the thing about melanoma is it doesn't respond like other cancers and is a beast. Literally.In August of 2020, China found out the cancer had spread again and this time to her brain. Crushing news. Two tumors. Tests showed at least one was inoperable. But #TeamSmith prevailed; hopeful and strong, determined to beat this monster called cancer. Her best course of treatment was Gamma Knife Treatment, so before starting treatment the the four members of the Smith family decided to take a trip over Labor Day Weekend to the beaches of California to get a break from Cancer and the pandemic. And, this is when the true nightmare began and why I am writing to all of you asking for your generous support for #TeamSmith and my dear friends, China, Christian and their two kids who are dear friends of my own kids. Picture this: driving along the 15S to California from Nevada with the 2 kids in the backseat (7 & 10 years old) all excited about their weekend road-trip when China starts complaining to Christian that she is getting a migraine, a bad one. At this point they are about 40 minutes away from home, nearly to the CA border and Christian tells her he will pull into a gas station and get 'Migraine Excedrin'... that never happened, by the time he pulled over, she was sick, like really sick. They waited nearly a 1/2 hour for the paramedics to arrive and she was rushed back to Vegas to the hospital. After China was stabilized, Christian found out China had suffered a stroke due to the two brain tumors hemorrhaging. Can you imagine?? One minute driving to the beach, the next being told your wife just had brain tumors start bleeding in her brain and paralysis was most likely going to be a real possibility. And, to top it off no one can even see her. Later that evening, China was transferred to a hospital closer to home, where she was admitted to the Neuro-ICU unit. Alone. All Alone. No one to hold her hand and tell her she is OK, no one to whisper in her ear she was loved and to fight. In the middle of a pandemic, China was all alone in the hospital; her family, not allowed even in the lobby were left to their own imagination and the visuals of what they saw their wife and mommy experience laying on the asphalt of a truck-stop waiting for the ambulance.Two days later, China underwent emergency brain surgery. The damage was already done, Speech challenges and partial paralysis. there was no alternative. She needed the doctors to go in, get the tumor out and clean up any damage done by the internal bleeding on the brain. China survived the surgery and is now in need of serious care; the neurosurgeon advised Christian the care she will require is now beyond what the family is able to provide at home do to her severe medical needs. She will require round the clock care and will be sent to rehab eventually and the children will then naturally need formal supervision for remote learning etc.Moving forward, once China is recovered from the surgery,it is hoped that China will undergo speech therapy to help her regain her speech and physical/occupational therapy to gain strength and fingers crossed some movement though the doctors believe the paralysis is permanent. Meanwhile all of this will occur simultaneously as China undergoes Chemo plus Autoimmune therapy to combat the cancer. All of this in a world-wide pandemic. In a pandemic. We are raising money to support #TEAMSMITH with any medical expenses not covered by insurance, to help get tutor/nanny to support the Smith kids with remote learning as school is not in session and ultimately, Christian will need to return to work. There is a long road ahead for China and her family. It wont be easy, but the last thing China or Christian need to worry about is money, dinner, bills or the kids schooling etc.We realize times are tough for everyone right now, living through this COVID Pandemic is not easy so don't feel bad about not donating if you can't - just share this request if you cannot donate. But, if you can donate please do and share this page. Remember no gift is too small, together we can support China in the fight for her life. China and Christian have never asked for help before, and to be honest, Christian hesitated even now, but they need us. This is our way of showing them how much we love them and how much they mean to us. This situation would be awful under any circumstances but given the pandemic, the circumstances call for resources unimaginable with education and isolation being in play. On behalf of the Smith Family, thank you for reading this far, thank you in advance for your continued prayers and generous donation to the Smith Family.Please note: All monies donated will go directly to Christian Smith on behalf of his beautiful wife and their children to support them during these most difficult of times for any medical/education/childcare/counseling etc needs they may have.Stay and well, and thank you for praying for our China-Li.Thank you.AlexRead more"

Ryan Lewis is the father of two sweet young girls (2 and 3). He's a hard-working member of a well respected locally-owned family business, Wolf's ProClean, a power washing company serving the Bryan/College Station market.

(Ryan, Tre, Dredon, Wolf)

On September, 10th, 2020 at 4:15 pm, a truck ran a red light and struck the SUV Ryan was riding in as a passenger. His nephew Dredon (second from the right) was driving the car. The accident was truly terrible, their vehicle was struck on the passenger's side rolling the car three times before it came to a rest on its roof with Ryan pinned under the car. Fuel was spilling everywhere, and thankfully other people came rushing and lifted the car up so that Ryan could be pulled out from under the roof.

By God's grace, Dre was shaken up, but not seriously injured and was able to crawl to freedom. The same cannot be said for Ryan.

Ryan suffered serious damage including:- Left rib fractures (multiple)- Left shoulder separation (grade 5)- Pelvic/sacral fractures- Urethra was torn from his prostate

Emergency Surgeries Completed:- Suprapubic catheter- Internal screws from right hip to sacrum- External fixator holding pelvis together for 4 weeks- Repaired left shoulder

Recovery Plan:- No weight on right leg for at least 6 weeks- TLSO brace 3 months any time he is sitting upright or moving- Unable to lift left arm- Wheelchair and/or crutches for the next 6 weeks at least.- Physical therapy to walk againFuture Surgeries:- Removal of the external fixator holding hips together (We hope he is put to sleep for that)- Revision of urethra in 6-8months- Once that heals, close/remove the suprapubic catheter

Frankly, there is more than I can list here. He is looking at weeks if not months in a wheelchair, a catheter for at least 3-to-6 months before he can have reconstructive surgery. Beyond medical bills, he cannot return to his second-story apartment and will have to stay with family. He cannot work for at least six months or more, and he faces future surgeries and complications that we cannot even calculate at this moment.

Immediate Needs Include:- Prayer...lots of prayer- A wheelchair- Crutches/walker with armrests- Contributions to help cover medical costs, therapy costs, lost income, and at-home support costs for the next many months.Ryan and his family need our help as a community. This is a hard-working honorable family that serves the Bryan/College Station community every single day. As a young father of two little girls, Ryan needs us to circle around them and hold them up in prayer, as well as, provide practical assistance so they can survive this very difficult time.

A family of givers...never asks for anything and are always the ones lending a helping hand and helping others. I’ve watched them suffer for the last 2 1/2 months, taking time off of work, taking time away from themselves and their families to make sure their husband/father was well taken care of in the hospital. Having been best friends with Lucrezia for so many years and them treating me like one of their own, I know there is no more deserving family to finally be free of all the worry, fear, and sadness. On November 9th the nightmare began. John Careccia was going for his daily coffee at a coffee shop he frequented for 50 years. John was brutally assaulted by a man with a metal broom. The criminal/perpetrator was charged with attempted murder and many assault charges, so you can only imagine what the investigation revealed!! From that moment on the Careccia’s family life changed forever. John’s brain shifted and was crushed to the right side. So much blood and pressure built up in his brain that his brain was trying to release itself from the skull. John was minutes away from death. He underwent major brain surgery. With the grace of God and all of his angels John survived the surgery. He then needed a tracheotomy and a feeding tube. He was in a coma for a month. John was left unable to use his limbs, talk, or eat. On December 22nd he went to rehab in upstate NY to start his recovery for his traumatic brain injury. His family is not able to see him because of Covid restrictions. On December 27th he ended up being rushed to a hospital upstate where he stayed away from his family for another 2 weeks. An emotional roller coaster to say the least and a marathon for John. He is now back in rehab where his family prays he will be able to walk, use his arms and hands, speak and eat again. He was responding really well to his family before he went to rehab but since he has left he hasn’t done much or responded to anyone. He has no recollection of what happened and does not recognize his family members at this time. His family wants him home. They want to care for him at home where they can stimulate him for hours a day to get his brain function back. Let’s all help in trying to get John home and make it so his family doesn’t have to worry financially with all the medical bill burden that will come along with getting him the proper care at home. Any little bit will help. His wife Giovanna and his children Maria, Vincenzo and Lucrezia just want their husband/Dad home.Read more"

He was a loving father to his three daughters, ages 24, 3, and 1, and his infant granddaughter. He had been a track athlete at UCLA. He was an incredible cook, an avid gardener, and a lover of wine tasting and traveling. In September 2019, Andru was rushed to Scripps Mercy Hospital in San Diego with debilitating pain in his knee. A recurrent staph infection spread to his bloodstream and latched onto his heart valve. His condition progressively worsened and he ended up in the ICU. A day later he was rushed into emergency open heart surgery to replace the valve; he was given a 5 percent chance of surviving the surgery. The medication he was given to raise his blood pressure before surgery reduced the blood flow to his extremities, resulting in gangrene.After surgery, Andru was still very fragile and had to be resuscitated three times. To save his life, doctors had to amputate his left leg above the knee and his left hand above the wrist. Andru has been recuperating in a nursing and rehab facility since December 2019. During that time has also lost four of the fingertips on his right hand and all of the toes on his right foot.Although Andru and his family are grateful that he survived this ordeal, he can no longer care for himself and his family in the same way. Andru strives to become an active father again. He wants to watch his young daughters grow up alongside his granddaughter. He wants to see his eldest daughter flourish. He wants to be with his wife Sarah. He wants to be able to help financially support his family someday.For now, Andru remains in need of daily nursing care and is working hard with the physical therapists to gain enough strength to get fitted for# prosthetics and go home. When he reaches that milestone, his home will need to be adapted and he will need months, if not years, of at-home care, costs that his insurance plan does not cover. The family nest egg has long been depleted.Andru has started a nonprofit,# Clarkesupport LLC, submitting already the 501(c)(3) to the IRS for federal tax exempt status, to help cover the medical bills that have already started to accumulate and all the future expenses of his disability. We know how hard people are struggling these days. We are therefore all the more grateful for any contribution to this #nonprofit (via GoFundMe) and “share” that you can give to this message.

We sold everything we owned including the family farm to fund this project. We built an expedition truck and set off to attempt every day to make a difference to the people we met, providing at no cost mental health education presentations to school children and their parents and communities at large. In that time we have travelled in excess of 60,000 kilometres and spoken to 10s of thousands of people.

23 days ago, Scott was rushed to a hospital in Brisbane where he was diagnosed with a golden staph infection in the hip; the infection had poisoned his blood which is a life threatening disease called septicaemia. 
The staph ate away Scott’s cartilage in the hip so when Scott finally gets well enough, he will require a hip replacement. In the process of lying in bed in agony for weeks without movement, Scott has also developed an extensive DVT (blood clot) running from his abdomen to his ankle that requires life long management. 

Whilst we are taking things one step at a time the plan is that as soon as Scott is able to move his legs without assistance, we will move from this hospital to the nearby rehab clinic, so that the road to full recovery can commence. 

Current and on-going costs include a number of echocardiograms, CT scans, MRI, ultra sounds, two surgeries, numerous specialists, Scotts rehab, accommodation in Brisbane, flights to Sydney, storage for our truck, on-going medical checks, hip replacement, clot management etc. 

We are forever hopeful that we will be back doing our needed work as early as possible in 2019. Sadly, theses medical costs will have a significant impact on our Sam Project budget. We have put aside our pride in the interests of the Sam Project and decided to follow the suggestion to start a Gofundme campaign. Any funds raised beyond our medical bills will be put towards the Sam Project. 

From the bottom of our heart thank you for what you can give to help us get back on the road doing what we are passionate about, making a difference to the future of all, especially the young, Australians. 
Every little bit counts.

As some of you may know, last March, John was diagnosed with what was believed to be Bell's Palsy and he expected the symptoms to improve over time. They did not. Instead, John has experienced the loss of muscle control on the right side of his face, vision changes, balance issues, hearing loss, and loss of taste. All while working a FT job as a Special Ed instructor (during Covid!) and Masters Candidate in a Visual Impairment grad program at NDSU.Last week, during an annual eye exam, John learned that he has significant pressure on his optic nerve, and a 9-hour visit to the neurologist revealed that the pressure was caused by four tumors on his brain. Two large, two small. We don't know yet what caused the tumors, though it's suspected that they've been present for a long time. We do know that they need to come out ASAP.On Wednesday, November 11th, John will have his first of two brain surgeries at Regions hospital in St. Paul, MN. The length of time he's in the hospital depends on how well he responds to surgery. The rehab and recovery will be significant and lengthy. There are so many unknowns right now.This difficult news comes at the heels of another major life change. In early October, and after nearly 20 years, John and I mutually and amicably chose to end our marriage. Though this separation feels like a positive change for our family, it's been complicated by our rental lease that ends in June and his recent lay-off (and the impending loss of health insurance) at Minneapolis Public Schools. We've decided that John will stay at our home with Themi on Penn Ave S while he finishes his senior year of high school. I've been staying with friends and will continue to do so until our lease ends and both of us find more permanent living arrangements. I'll return to our home at Penn Ave S to be with Themi while John is in the hospital and when my presence at home is needed.This is the part where I humbly ask for your support. What would be most helpful right now are your prayers, notes of encouragement (address below), help with meals or tasks (https://mealtrain.com/mn3ggl ), and financial support to cover medical costs and his income loss for the year. Financial strain impacts recovery and we want John to heal quickly and completely.This situation is rapidly evolving and our family is taking it hour by hour. We ask that you give John space to feel what he's feeling. Right now, talking about surgery and what the future looks like is a significant source of stress for him. I'll do my best to post updates here as we learn more. Until then, thank you so much for loving us and supporting us.ADDRESS (John & Themi)4928 Penn Ave SMinneapolis, MN 55419*For now, I'm also receiving mail at this addressRead more"

He already suffered from a few back conditions, however the fall made them even worse, resulting in a severe case of a Herniated Disc in his L4 & L5 vertebra. The herniated disc was pressing up against his spine putting immense pressure on the nerves that control the function of his bowels, bladder and the feeling in his legs & feet, leaving him immobile.Josh was rushed into emergency surgery where he had the herniated disc removed. His Doctors & Surgeons said it was the worst case they had ever seen.Now that the surgery is over, Josh has a long road to recovery ahead of him. Between the hospital stay and rehab facility he will accrue over a month of hospital bills.He has lost sensation of his legs & feet and sensation/control of his bowels & bladder which doctors are saying can take up to 2 years to gain back, if at all.

X-rays were done and she was told that she is just sore from doing back bends and sent home. The next day, things got much worse. Suddenly Avery couldn’t walk without the help of her parents and she was falling. She also lost control of her bladder. All of these symptoms were extremely frightening for a 12 year old girl. They took her back to the ER and on Friday evening, they were told that Avery has a brain bleed. Before they had time to process what was happening, Avery was on the Life Flight Helicopter, alone and scared out of her mind. Mom, dad and Avery’s siblings met Life Flight at Children’s Memorial Hermann in the medical center.As soon as Avery arrived, we were told it was hydrocephalus which is a build up of fluid on the brain, increasing pressure to her brain. They took her into the OR for an emergency ventriculostomy or EVD. This would hopefully pull some of the fluid off and relieve the pressure. Following the procedure, our Neurosurgeon, Dr. Sandburg, informed us that there is a “massive” tumor on Avery’s Thalamus. The thalamus is the part of your brain that controls sleep/wake cycles. Monday afternoon, Dr. Sandburg took Avery to the OR again to try and remove as much of the tumor as possible and send some tissue off for a biopsy. The surgery took a grueling 5 hours. Unfortunately, what is left of the Tumor is still quite large and due to its location, it is too risky to remove. It looks like a Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) grade 2 tumor. What we know is that it is extremely rare (only 1,083 people living with it in the US). What we don’t know yet is if it’s cancerous or not. Biopsy results should take a week so until then, we are all just holding our breath and praying, praying so hard.Avery has been able to stand up with some assistance, she is saying a few words here and there with a lot of coaxing, and is not tolerating some food by mouth. She will have the EVD for at least a few more days and continue to stay in the hospital until she is stable, and then be transferred to an inpatient rehab for physical therapy and speech therapy. Avery has been so strong and brave throughout this. Her personality has been shining through in her own goofy silly ways.A little back story...Avery is almost 12 years old, the youngest of 4 kids. Avery is sweet, soft spoken, so loving and affectionate. She is the best babysitter there is. She loves spending time with all of her younger cousins and entertaining them. Avery’s parents, Jennifer and Charles, have been by Avery’s side every day, while also trying to take care of their other young kids at home. Jennifer and Charles are people of strong faith. We are constantly in awe of my sister Jennifer’s belief and conviction. It is unwavering and something to strive for. Jennifer, is an English teacher in Cypress and is the sole provider for their family. Because of COVID, Jennifer has no more time off and will have to go back to work in one week. They are in need of any financial assistance that they can get right now.Avery and family have a very long and challenging journey ahead of them. Our God is a good God and He is in control. Please be a hero today and help out in any way you can to fight for Avery! Every little bit counts. Thank you for your support.Read more"

To say that Ryan and Kirstie are the average family next door is an understatement. Ryan is 40 years old and a hard working family man. A field tech for TPC Systems, loving husband of almost 14 years and hands-on dad to two energetic, young sons. And just like with the average family, money is always tight. But it was important to Ryan & Kirstie that they not put their boys in daycare, so Kirstie managed to get a job at Bridgeport Hospital as an ER scribe, working the overnight shift 4 days a week so she could be there when the kids got home from school. Ryan and Kirstie both quietly made great sacrifces on behalf of their happy little family every day and it worked. They lived a simple life but always had something to share with the many friends and family members that knew the door was always open.And then EVERYTHING changed! Did you just blink? Because that’s how quickly the universe turned upside down for this poor family…in the blink of an eye! On Wednesday, August 3, 2016, Ryan was found unresponsive at work. He had gone into cardiac arrest. It is unknown exactly how long his brain was deprived of oxygen. The doctors now believe he had a mild heart attack 4 to 6 weeks ago that his heart never recovered from, and all the while, one side of his heart was enlarging to compensate for the other, damaged side. If you’re like me, at this point you’re wondering, “didn’t he have symptoms?!” Well yes, but without the benefit of hindsight everything did have a reasonable explanation. He complained of indigestion…not exactly uncommon. He was sweating profusely that last week of July but we all were here in Connecticut – it was hot! And Ryan either worked outside or inspecting hot elevator shafts, old buildings without air-conditioning, etc. He was also extremely tired at the end of the day, but again, given the heat, that wasn’t exactly alarming either. And remember…he’s only 40!Now he lies in ICU, critical but stable; intubated, in a medically induced coma. They can’t even address the blockage he has because right now the top priority is determining if there is any brain damage.Does this sound like a nightmare yet? You wouldn’t think it possibly could, but it gets worse. I neglected to mention that on Monday, August 1, 2016, Kirstie lost her job due to outsourcing. No doubt, the stress of which was a contributing factor to Ryan’s cardiac arrest only two days later. This family has an immediate need for monetary funds. Ryan only has one week of vacation time left which will need to be used so they can start the process for him to collect Disability. They have a mortgage and the usual setof bills. The grocery bill alone to feed an 8 year-old boy and an 11 year-old boy could bankrupt a king! They don’t currently have a car payment but with Kirstie’s car at 168,000 miles and Ryan’s at 189,000 (and hardly reliable enough to go to the corner store without breaking down), they actually need a new car. And the medical bills?! We can’t even fathom how quickly those will pile up! Best case scenario, if and when Ryan pulls through this, he has months of surgery, rehab, therapy and recovery coming.Please. We are asking for your help. Today I am asking that you can find it in your heart to give something, even small, and possibly to a complete stranger, if for no other reason than because tomorrow you may blink and find you need help. I know times are hard and money is tight…at least I thought I knew. After what happened to Ryan and Kirstie, maybe things aren’t as bad for me as I thought. It could’ve been my family. It could’ve been me.Thank you for all the help you can give!Love, Ryan and Kirstie's Family(P.S. - In the interest of full disclosure, Ryan & Kirstie had a family trip planned to Disney World in November. They already have their airline tickets purchased, were staying as guests at their friends’ timeshare and were getting help with park passes. At this time, this vacation sadly is probably a moot point but we would NEVER want anyone to think that any donations they’re making in good faith would ever be used in that manner.)Read more"

She was advised that the survival rate for this type of sarcoma was 5%, however, she persevered and beat all odds. She was given time off from her treatment to give her body time to recuperate as it was weak from chemotherapy. Over that short period, she slowly lost feeling in her legs. She was rushed to the hospital where they found cancer cells pressing on her spinal cord. An emergency spinal surgery was scheduled and performed as she would've been paralyzed without it.Following the procedure, Renisa was sent to a rehab facility to help her regain mobility. While receiving her therapy treatment, the doctors overseeing her ordered an MRI and CT scan for the head, abdomen, and torso. The results were devastating... Not only did she have a sinus infection which caused constant headaches,also a new tumor is pressing on the cervical region of the spinal cord. This caused semi-paralysis in the upper portion of her left arm. She was rushed back to the hospital as her symptoms are getting worse. Her oncologist recommended her to be put on Chemotherapy in the pill form and also a few sessions of radiation.Since her diagnosis, her family has been there for her physically, emotionally and also financially.Even with insurance, medical billshave been afinancial burden. Her family has been stuck wondering ""How do you get help with medical expenses that aren’t covered?"" After Renisa received her diagnosis in October, she was told she would have 8 months to a year to live. Then at a follow up in December she was told a few months. In her most recent meeting, her Oncologist's nurse told her a few days to a week to live. Her family doesn't believe that! Renisa is a fighter and she won't let this cancer kill her. She has always been the selfless type that would give you the shirt off her back, who puts everyone in front of her. She was reluctant to even have this page set up for her as she would rather give than receive. However,she wants to get a second opinion but insurance only covers so much. There are a lot of companies out there that offer treatment but don't accept the health insurance that she currently has. Every day is a constant fight, Renisa wants to live more than anything in this world. She wants to beat cancer and be rid of it for good. There have been times where she feels to give up but is reminded that she has so much to live for. Family, friends and many loved ones who would love to see her live a long, healthy and prosperous life. Never in a million years would Renisa or her family think they would need help but every does at some point. This page was created not only toraise funds to help with Renisa's medical bills, her living expenses and also any additional treatment. She has been unable to work since being diagnosed, so she isn't financially able to do much.They appreciate any amount of gifts you are able to extend to Renisa as she moves from this difficult time toward a full recovery, they ask for your generosity, your prayers, and good wishes.Read more"

Youcan always count on her to be your friend, no matter how well she knows you, how you look, where you come from, or what your history is. She believes in doing the right thing, being kind to all, and trusting in her faith more than anything. She's unapologically confident and outspoken, incredibly hardworking, and always looking out for the people in her life. You could ask anyone what her impact has been on them and they'd tell you without hesitation that Monica has changed their lives for the better.On Saturday, Sept. 10, 2016,Monica was entering a crosswalk across the street from her campus when she was struck at full speed by a unattentive driver who sped away after the incident. She was on her way back from checking this week's schedule for her new job, which she attained to help pay for a private loan she took out for her studies. After she was struck, a bystander on the scene rushed to her side to help her to safety, calling 911.Monica just started her freshman year of college at Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, AZ, so we her parents, who live in Madison, WI, were about 1,600 miles away from her. Though financially burdening, Katie was able to book an expensive one-way redeye to Arizona within a few hours, not knowing when she might be able to come home.Though Monica is currently stable in the ICU at JC Lincoln Hospital, she faces many injuries and medical issues that will take many months to recover from. Her left leg is broken in several places, including her tibia and femur, her left ankle is shattered and her pelvic bone has a t-line fracture. She had six surgeries to place skin grafts, insert steel rods in her leg, stabilize her pelvic bone, and set her ankle.Monica stayed at the hospital for most of the month of September, which should end with a medical transport to a rehab facility in Madison in a few days.We are so lucky that she is alive and now on the upturn, but these next several months are going to be mental, physical and financial hardships for her.I do ask if you would donate anything, even just a few dollars if that's all you can give, to help with the following:- Travel expenses for us to fly to and from Madison, WI to stay with Monica- Medical necessities for Monica to be able to continue to recover and rehabilitate- Medical expenses including surgeries, hospital stays, and a medical transport back to MadisonIf you are not in a place where you can give, please share this GoFundMe page with as many people as possible, and encourage your friends to do so as well.Thank you for reading, donating, and sharing.*** please do not stop donating after we hit our goal - weneed as much help as possibleRead more"

Have you noticed how stories of personal triumph often begin with tragedy? How adversity creates modern day hero's? Here is a story of a boy, a would-be hero. Let his battle inspire you to re-examine adversity in your life.On Sunday, July 26, 2020, 14-year-old Wyatt Ellis went to sleep with a bad headache, only to awaken in the in the intensive care unit at Texas Children’s hospital, paralyzed from the jaw down.Upon arrival, Wyatt was diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, a rare infection that causes swelling of the brain and spinal cord. The swelling tissue compressed his spinal cord against his skull, blocking blood flow, resulting in a severe spinal cord injury and paralysis initially from the jaw down. Wyatt’s current condition is called ""Locked In Syndrome"" (LIS) or pseudo coma. Wyatt is fully conscious with his mental capacity unaffected, but he cannot move or communicate verbally due to paralysis of nearly all voluntary muscles in his body, except for eye movements, blinking, and now smiling.YES, SMILING :-)Even though Wyatt is trapped inside his body, he remains positive and funny. He has been learning to communicate by blinking his eyes to indicate a letter and spelling words. It is a very tedious and frustrating process to say the least.His first word, H-U-N-G-R-YHis second word, C-H-I-C-K--F-I-L--A (his favorite fast-food restaurant :-)Prior to Wyatt’s illness, he was a healthy and active teenager who loved to fish, explore the outdoors, and ride his mountain bike in state parks. He is well known for his constant smile, positive outlook, and resilient spirit. Wyatt has been eagerly awaiting playing high school football his freshman year. He deserves every opportunity to rebuild his life.The Wyatt that we know and love is still very much with us. Doctors are treating him as a spinal stroke patient, but only time will tell if he might regain use of his body, including the ability to breath or swallow on his own. He will require continued medical support, extensive rehab, advanced eye-communication devices, and long-term care to build a new life.Hospital visitation restrictions due to Covid-19 are adding additional hardships by preventing other family members from visiting and taking shifts at the hospital. Wyatt’s mother and father have been alternating shifts by his side continuously. They are the only family permitted access. Their hometown is nearly 80 miles away (one way) from the hospital and Wyatt has five other siblings at home.We have started this recovery fund to help Wyatt’s family pay for on-going medical costs, lodging, fuel, food, parking, and to acquire better communication devices so Wyatt can communicate his basic needs. Please help us support Wyatt Ellis and his family and give him the best chance at life. His family has a very rough road ahead and we are continually praying for the best possible outcome. Wyatt’s family would like to express their deepest gratitude to everyone who has offered to help and for their continued prayers.You can follow Wyatt's story here on his mother's Facebook page:

Roslyn and her family have been our neighbors for our entire lives and we wanted to be able to help during these difficult times. They never ask for assistance and so we believe they deserve it more so than anyone we know. Below is a passage by Laura Meola, one of Roslyn's talented daughters, and tells the story of her mother and what her family has endured during these difficult times. We'd greatly appreciate if you take the time to read and help spread the word and to help in any way that you can.The Story of a Warrior: Roslyn MeolaLet me tell you about a warrior. A woman who defied the odds. She is truly a miracle. My mother Roslyn has been through hell and back. She is a breast cancer survivor. She fought through having a mastectomy and chemo for that. She won. She is a skin cancer survivor. She had multiple melanomas removed and immunotherapy treatments. She fought through that and won. This all happened in a matter of a few years. She is my Superwoman. Through all of that, 2020 came. She was high risk to the corona virus. My family and I tried our hardest to keep her safe. Unfortunately, she couldn't stay home all the time and had doctor visits and immunotherapy to attend. No matter how hard we tried to keep her safe, the virus found her. We don't know how or where she got it from, but she go it. Devastation hit our family as she fought to survive. She has been on a ventilator for almost four months. The doctors told us multiple times she may not survive, yet she kept defying the odds. We prayed each night for a miracle because she deserved to come back to us. Finally she has started to find her way back home to us. She spent three months in the hospital and upon departure went straight to rehab. We continue to pray for her safe return home. She has been through so much, I can't even begin to imagine her pain and worry. She deserves to find the comfort of her home, family and friends once again. She deserves to find peace in her life and to have a break from all of the chaos that she fought so valiantly to overcome. I want to help take some of the burden off of her shoulders by offering to help her find financial support. I can not even imagine what the final sum of bills will be after a four plus months hospital and rehab stay. All I know is this should be the last thing on her mind when she comes home. Her focus should be on healing and living, not on financial strain.She is a true miracle, a warrior and a survivor. I implore you to share her story. Tell your friends of the cancer survivor that endured being in the hospital on a respirator for months and is still here to tell her story. We can only continue to pray that she can come home and share her wisdom of how she fought through these most troubling times.Anything you can contribute to help would be VERY MUCH APPRECIATED and a blessing for our mother and family. Even if it's not monetary, please continue to pass the word and pray for our mothers safe return home.God Bless You and Thank You,Sincerely The Meola Family & FriendsRead more"

After doing a biopsy it was determined that the lump was an injection site sarcoma due to the leukemia vaccination he received from his previous vet. In order to help save his life and prevent immediate suffering from the tumor, Alfy required immediate surgery on 3/5 to remove the tumor. The tumor removal was a success, but the tumor was a grade 3 sarcoma which means Alfy needs radiation therapy to help prevent it from returning. The initial biopsy, CT scan, and surgery have already cost $5,000 and the radiation will be an additional $8,000. I am currently completing my occupational therapy unpaid clinical at Emory Decatur inpatient rehab and will not have a steady income until August/September after I have passed my boards and can get employment. Gavin is currently employed, but having to pay all of this money up front in a 2 month span of time has been hard. Alfy is a really sweet boy and was failed by his previous vet because they vaccinated him in a location that is no longer recommended by veterinary experts which made has made his treatment much more expensive. If they had given the vaccine in the distal limb as recommended we could have amputated without requiring extra treatment measures, this would have also further reduced chances of reoccurrence.

If you know Nordia you know she is a great mother and always puts that sweet little girl before herself. She has always been a very hard worker and a great mother. Sadly last summer she started experiencing some stomach pain. It just felt like a burning sensation, pretty mild at first and then it became worse. As the pain worsened it became difficult to eat and she began to lose weight.In August doctors did an upper endoscopy and found a mass. Nordia was sent home with antibiotics. Her health continued to decline over the next couple of months, and day to day functions became nearly impossible. In October she experienced a seizure and her little girl found her unconscious on the floor. Nordia was transported to St Joseph Hospital where it was determined that she had a bilateral pulmonary embolism. She was diagnosed with metabolic acidosis, anemia, leukocytosis, hyperatremia, pneumonia, elevated liver enzymes and was in respiratory failure. She was placed in the ICU in extreme critical condition. Being unable to breath on her own due to respiratory failure a trach was inserted and she was placed in a medically induced coma, where she remained for over a month. During this time Nordia was officially diagnosed with Gastric Cancer.From Saint Joseph hospital she went to Kindred Hospital for respiratory therapy to learn to talk and breathe on her own again. From Kindred she went to Overland Park Rehab to gain strength on her right side and to learn to walk again. She was finally strong enough to go home on December 24th, more than two months after she passed out from the seizure back in October. She was back in the hospital on January 5th after another seizure, and then again a week later. Nordia's continues to fight this uphill battle. She recently underwent surgery to insert a G-tube, and then had to go back to the emergency room when the G-tube failed. She is preparing to begin radiation and chemotherapy. I asked Nordia how her illness has affected her. Her response was ""in so many ways. I can't see properlyanymore due to loss of peripheral vision in my right eye due to this illness. My body has become disfigured; I now have a G-tube I walk around with. I live in constant fear of when the next seizure will be, or the next time I will pass out and end up back in the hospital, or even worse back in a coma. I am weak and daily tasks are almost impossible. It breaks my heart how hard it is to take care of my daughter now, and it tears me up inside to know how much Kennedy has had to sacrifice due to my cancer. I worry constantly how I will afford necessary medicine, keep a roof over our heads and utilities on. I live in a constant state of worry about becoming homeless, and I worry even more that I will die and what will happen to my little girl.""Nordia has been unable to work since September due to her cancer and complications. Unfortunately her health insurance ran out on December 31st. She is still far too weak to even consider being able to return to work. Please rally with me to raise funds for this single Momma. Nordia has enough on her plate just trying to fight this cancer and taking care of Kennedy, she doesn't need to worry about these very basic things. Please help me to take this added stress from her.

Within hours, she was completely paralyzed from the hips down. Just the morning before, she was living the life of a normal nineteen-year-old girl but for almost three months now, she has been unable to walk or stand.  Unfortunately, after 38 days in the hospital and 6 weeks at Mount Sinai Spinal Injury Rehab, Stefanie is still undiagnosed. Doctor’s suspect she has a rare neuro-immune disorder (less than 1400 cases a year) known as Transverse Myelitis. While our immune system normally works to protect our bodies from foreign invaders, Stefanie’s immune cells are mistakenly attacking her own tissue, and in this case, her spinal cord. Stefanie has now lost most of the feeling and function of her lower body.  Transverse Myelitis currently does not have a cure and doctors are unsure whether she will ever be able to walk again. In the past few months, Stefanie has gone through countless procedures and treatments, some life threatening, to try to gain back the quality of life she once had. She had ports put into her neck to have plasma exchanges. She received endless amounts of IV treatments, as well as, surgeries, infusions, dozens of MRIs, X-rays, blood tests, and several spinal taps. She is working tirelessly in both physical and occupational therapy to not only try to regain use of her legs, but also to become as independent and successful as possible in her current state. All the while Stefanie has been remaining hopeful and is continuing her education at Binghamton University via test proctors and online work.  Now she has moved on to the next step in her recovery; living at home and attending outpatient therapy. Modifications to Stefanie’s two-story house to make it handicap accessible for her have resulted alone in over $20,000 debt, which doesnt include the thousands of dollars already accumulated from the medical procedures, testing, hospitalizations, physical and occupational therapy, medications, home equipment, and getting her a wheelchair.  The most important thing for Stefanie to be focusing on right now is her recovery, but instead she is looking at thousands of dollars of debt. She has the strength and will to overcome this and our donations will help ease the toll this life-changing diagnosis is taking on her. No donation is too small, and anything is greatly appreciated. If you cannot afford to make a donation due to financial circumstances of your own, just sharing this page will provide support. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and let’s work together to help Stefanie get better!Read more"

Our childhood friend Diane Zeng Malley’s husband Matt, 38 years old, has been in the hospital for over 100 days. In mid-October of 2016, Matt went to his doctor with flu like symptoms, was diagnosed with an infection and sent home. Late during the night of October 22, Diane found Matt in their bed having seizures and burning up. She immediately called an ambulance which took Matt to the closest hospital. Within two hours, Matt had to be transported to Northwell Manhasset, a much larger facility that has the doctors necessary to treat him. Matt and Diane are familiar with that hospital- just two years ago, he was treated there for grand mal seizures related to a childhood condition. During this three week stay, Matt had kidney failure, brain shunt revision surgery, and was intubated. Luckily, with the help of his doctors and support of his family, he was able to go back to teaching and resume his normal life in a few months.This time, within Matt’s first week of being in the Northwell Neurosurgical ICU, he experienced more extreme multi-organ failure and became gravely ill. He was put on full dialysis, and doctors began looking for transplant options for his kidneys and liver. Matt has had 13 surgeries in an effort to repair his badly damaged organs. Diane has been told several times that the family should prepare for the worst. He has been tested for autoimmune diseases, cancers, blood disorders and rare infections. Doctors have been unable to pinpoint the cause of this organ failure and his weight has dropped by 85 pounds. He currently needs a feeding tube to ensure he is getting the nutrients he so badly needs to survive. He also has a trach collar which helps with getting oxygen to his lungs when he needs help. Matt is starting to get some physical therapy that consists of dangling his legs. But with the feeding tube, many rehab places will not take him. Diane is praying he gets stronger to get the rehab help he needs as Matt continues to fight to regain his life.Before Matt’s previous hospital stay, life had not been kind to the Malley family. Matt was excessed at his job in the Roosevelt schools, causing them to lose their home in Massapequa Park, and move into Diane’s family home in Farmingdale. They live there with Diane’s parents, their dog Murphy, their beautiful 6-year old daughter Erin and their handsome little boy Connor, 2 ½. The children have only been to the hospital twice to see their father, and Diane hasn’t heard Matt’s voice since that evening in October. They have been married for almost 10 years, and together for 15. They are so blessed to have such a large family, on both sides that have been helping with the kids and staying over night at the hospital.Both Matt & Diane are popular local teachers and coaches- Matt in the Island Trees and Roosevelt School District and Diane in Syosset. Matt has also coached for Holy Trinity and South Side. Diane and Matt have dedicated their lives to improving the communities they live and work in through their teaching, coaching and community involvement. Many of the people whose lives they have touched have asked how they can help. The medical bills are mounting, and we are hoping that through the GoFundMe page and the fundraiser on April 1st at the Nutty Irishman in Farmingdale, we can help ease the burden. More details to follow regarding the event.Read more"

He has been the best possible friend imaginable to us!Now Barkley is too old to travel, and so for the last 15 months we've spent most of our time at home with him. A year ago Barkley nearly lost his ability to walk, and we started him at an amazing rehab center for dogs called Back on Track. He's received body work, acupuncture, laser therapy (where he has to wear goggles!), and best of all, underwater treadmill therapy. All of this has kept him walking, and most of the time he seems happy and relatively comfortable. Because Barkley needs constant supervision, we've limited our working time on the road, and therefore we've also greatly limited our income. We've steadily accumulated a large debt, since we can't bear to stop doing the things that are helping Barkley so much. Barkley's rehab bill in the last year was over $8,000, not including his regular veterinary care or the high price of quality pet care when we do travel(which costs about $2000 per month).  Now we're nearing the end of ourcredit limits and have decided to ask friends for help with our past and future expenses for Barkley. Barkley has met hundreds and hundreds of people in our travels and has lots of good friends (dogs, cats, and people)! He just turned 16, and he's been with us since we adopted him at 7 months from the Oregon Humane Society. Since we never had children, he's been our baby. We would be extremely grateful to you for helping us get out of debt from Barkley's care and for helping us help him for the rest of his life. His unswerving, unconditional love has been one of the greatest blessings of our lives, and we want to give him back as much as we possibly can!Thank you so much!!With love and gratitude,Heather, Benjy and BarkleyRead more"

He had suffered a sudden and unexpected severe brain bleed (specifically an acute subdural hematoma) from which he required two brain surgeries and removal of a blood clot in his brain. He suffered two mini strokes as he nearly bled out on the operating table which required him to have two blood transfusions. In order to save his life, doctors needed to remove part of his skull to relieve the pressure in his brain, and this will require another surgery after rehab to replace the missing bone flap. Jeff spent four long days in ICU and 9 days in the hospital overall where they ran numerous CT scans,an MRI, and ran numerous tests totry and stop the bleed. Through all of this, the doctors, surgeons and nurses called him the “Miracle Man” as he regained consciousness and even under sedation was able to make jokes and be his funny self to nurses. However, his right side is quite weak and he is in a rehab facility to learn how to walk and refine motor functions again. Eventually, he will return home with visits from a nurse for home therapy and have to wear a protective helmet that will serve as his temporary skull until they perform a surgery with a synthetic bone flap to repair his skull.The recovery from an acute subdural hematoma will be a long process, but anyone who knows Jeff knows he is strong and won't give up. Anything you can contribute would be a huge help to him, his family, and the upcoming months of therapy, doctor visits, and medical bills. He is so dearly loved by everyone, a huge part of the Bostoncommunity and music scene, and we are all here to support him.

Always a fighter, Randy dove right in with and a trusted team of medical professionals and--equally important--a warrior attitude to develop and activate a treatment plan. He started chemotherapy in November but did not react well to his first two treatments and unfortunately, spent two weeks in the hospital followed by two weeks in a rehab facility. Randy returned home, but quickly took a turn for the worse. He kept his battle private and did his best to deal with the unfortunate circumstances the fates had dealt him. But, the medical bills started rolling in and his insurance only covers a fraction of the ever-mounting costs, and didn't address living expenses for him and his family since he was unable to work. As such, please consider donating or sharing this campaign to help with their unexpected medical expenses and financial pressures. Every contribution goes directly to the Alexander family. In case you aren’t familiar with Randy, his firm, Randex Communications, has spent more than two decades as the Philadelphia region’s premiere entertainment and lifestyle PR/marketing agency. His clients through the years have included the likes of “Saturday Night Live” icon Joe Piscopo, The Hooters, Disco Biscuits, The Amazing Kreskin and Deep Purple. Among his more recent clients were Oscar-winning composer Franke Previte, the popular series of Time-Life music cruises and pop music immortals Kenny Gamble & Leon Huff.Randy has also devoted much time, effort and energy to such non-profit entities as the Philadelphia Music Alliance , which is the custodian of Philly’s monumental musical legacy, and the Asbury Park-based Light of Day Foundation, which is dedicated to Parkinson’s Disease education and research.Randy lived in Marlton, NJ with his wife Randi (yes, it’s Randy + Randi).

He was always ahead of his time. He wired every classroom, then put in Wi-Fi, then put in a 1:1 initiative—all before these things were things to do.In 2013, after a 25 year career in education, Greg retired. He and his wife Carol began enjoying an active retirement. They made new friends, took leisurely walks, fished more, took up kayaking, and enjoyed their cutie grand-kids. In July of 2019, everything changed when a routine back surgery left Greg paralyzed from the chest down.Over the last 18 months, Greg has experienced a lifetime of pain, had multiple surgeries, done a lot of soul searching, and reconnected with his faith. He's also been in constant rehab to try to stand and walk again, which he is committed to do!Pictures—past and present.https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPKmNS8h-EcWL50V7XUOjTJ7f9WWFKqM-hC9NOrSWS6fFmGDL00NGIlhbpc4Ha9Sg?key=WXhFUTNJVUlGVmN3TTZpYmJ4S1VDY25KaWxXSDhnGreg has churned through a big chunk of his retirement savings in the face of this new life challenge. Throughout though, he has tapped some of the skills that made him a great a tech director, including finding innovative tools and shopping around to find a good price.Recently he found a new wheelchair that can lift his body into a vertical position. Getting his body to stand would make such a life difference for him and Carol. But it's just not financially doable without some help.Please consider helping Greg stand up again. He's loves to cook, and he said the first thing he plans to do when standing in the chair is to make a meal in the kitchen for Carol.Read more"

Meilita is always smiling and full of positive energy and it was always fun to teach her tennis. She made great strides the last few years. God help her. We love you, Slezak family. 11/21/2020 Per Gofundme request, which I disagree with and feel that all the following info should have it's own place and do not interfere with the above story...... My name is Robert Slezak and I live in Palos Hills, IL. I am close friend of Meilita's family. For the past 3 years i teach her tennis and ever since then, she practiced with me and my daughter sometimes as much as 4 times per week. Meilita is doubles partner of my daughter on their high school team.  I have started this fundraiser for 2 reasons: 1. Even with the insurance, we all know that in the case this serious, the bills are coming and I wanted her parents to not ever worry about paying those bills. I also wanted to have money available for them to seek best available possibilities for pre-surgery, surgery and post surgery stages of her recovery. 2. I wanted to use this platform to keep everyone who is interested in Meilita's recovery updated on regular basis and in this way, keep the immediate family focused on their very difficult task on hand. Every penny of Your donations will be spent on Meilita's medical bills, including surgeries and rehab. Once she fully recover and all the bills are paid I will let her choose another child in need to use the rest the donations for or refund the leftovers to its donors. Every time her family is presented with medical bill for her Spinal stroke injury and all subsequent efforts to heal it, we will post that bill and withdraw exact amount from this fund to pay that bill. And so on. I am shocked and overwhelmed by peoples generosity and good will. When the goal was set, I thought it may take a year to reach it. Meanwhile we're two thirds there not even 2 days in. I wanted to thank each one of You for the well wishes, donations and especially praying for Meilita's recovery. God bless You all.Read more"

During this time, he has been battling with the insurance company and WorkSafe to approve the operation to have his leg amputated, which will help him move on with life. The good news is that the approval has finally come through and the amputation is planned for early March 2021. Unfortunately they need to arrange their own transport from Melbourne to Sydney and the cheapest option for them is to drive.We don’t think a 10 hour drive is a good idea for someone in Bart’s condition, so we are raising money to fund Bart and Corali’s travel expenses to Sydney and back. The money we raise will go directly to them to pay for return airfares, taxis, accommodation and basic living expenses before Bart goes into hospital for the operation. After a week in hospital, he will return to Melbourne for 6-8 weeks of intensive rehab.All donations no matter how small will really help Bart and Corali as they go through this tough time.Thanks for your support.Kind regards,Carmen & DarrenRead more"

He has brought that commitment and dedication to his recovery and continues to make progress every day. Scott will need intense and long term rehab once he is discharged home.

After running numerous tests, doctors discovered that Jordyn was in a diabetic coma and didn't believe she would make it through the night.As soon as they heard, her parents jumped in a car and drove overnight from upstate New York to Nashville, TN. They have taken time off work to spend every day in the hospital with her, constantly meeting with doctors, keeping family and friends updated, reading and talking to Jordyn, and urging her to wake up.After nearly a week of ups and downs, multiple rounds of dialysis, CT scans, EEGs, MRIs, and tons and tons of medications, Jordyn has finally stabilized and come out of her coma. She was taken off of the ventilator on February 21st and is now breathing on her own. She is starting to open her eyes, follow commands to blink or wiggle her toes, and respond to yes/no questions by nodding or shaking her head.Unfortunately, Jordyn has a long road ahead of her. Her kidneys and liver are still not functioning, and her doctors are afraid that she may have suffered neurological damage based on how long she was unconscious for. There may be other long term treatment needs too, such as physical therapy or rehab. Not to mention, learning to live with her new diagnosis will be a major adjustment.With the unexpected nature of everything, she’ll be taking time off from her job at Warby Parker for continued dialysis and treatment. Anyone who knows Jordyn knows that she goes above and beyond for her friends, family, and work.

I was sitting on the bed while nurse Gerald went about his nightly routines with a big smile on his face as usual. My dad, Gerald, and I chatted regularly and had a lot of fun together. Gerald was waiting for my dad to finish brushing his teeth (in the electric recliner) when out of the blue the recliner powered up and started leaning back for no apparent reason. Believing with his whole heart the chair had become possessed by some malevolent spirit, Gerald glazed over and bolted from the room. I found him in the hallway with his hand over his heart - simultaneously scared out of his wits and laughing hysterically. ""Gerald, my dad was sitting on the controller,"" I assured him. ""Everything's fine."" Gerald and I became fast friends and have shared many such laughs over the years.Gerald continues to be one of the finest caregivers you will ever meet - everyone's favorite. Unfortunately,in September of this year, he contracted COVID-19. Gerald's symptoms were severe and primarily neurological. Within a short time, he became paralyzed from the neck down, disoriented, and unable to speak. Gerald spent more than three weeks in the ICU on a ventilator, and his survival was at times in doubt. There were no underlying conditions, and the sole diagnosis was COVID-19.The good news is he is slowly recovering and gaining strength. Gerald can breathe on his own, move his hands and one leg slightly, and has just begun to speak. He has a long way to go and will spend significant time in rehab, learning to walk and talk again. Since the ordeal began, Gerald's wife (also a nurse) has been unable to work because of their son's in-home schooling requirements and the need to care for their newborn daughter. Everyone in their household has now had COVID, fortunately not as severe as Gerald's case.In light of this unfolding situation, would you consider contributing to ease the burden of Gerald's mounting medical expenses? It can be difficult for someone like Gerald - who has given his life to the care of others - to receive help, but the need is real. Gerald has worked tirelessly his whole life, courageously moving from Kenya to the USA as a young man to seek additional education, pursue a vocation, and start a family of his own. We all experience setbacks in life, andhave all endured some degree of COVID-related hardship this year. Yet, Gerald's circumstances are beyond what he and his young family should have to bear alone.If you are not in a position to contribute financially, please pray for Gerald and his family, and share the story as widely as you like.For many, COVID-19 has been little more than a series of inconveniences. For others, it's been a frightening, world-rocking reality. Gerald and his family have a solid faith and are confident of a bright future.Maybe we can lend a helping hand.

ENGLISH, scroll naar beneden voor Nederlands:Hi,My name is Kelly, I'm 23 years old and from the Netherlands.About 10 years ago, I started noticing a lot of pain in my body, and I struggled with intestine issues my whole life. As I got sicker and sicker, no one knew what was going on. About 3 years later, I finally ended up with doctors that instantly knew something was terribly wrong. During my graduation I was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that causes chronic pain and fatigue, and later on with Postural tachycardia syndrome, a disorder that causes heart problems. These illnesses cause me extreme amounts of pain and sickness.

I was very close to giving up on life, but ended up asking for help and finally started developing a life for myself. I went to rehab to learn how to live with my illnesses. I got a few mobility aids, my wheelchair and my mobility scooter, and here is where I'm asking you for help.I am desperately trying to get a Canta car, I can't get a license due to my illnesses. I am trying to be as independent as possible, and create a life worth living for myself. This car would improve my quality of life greatly, I'd be able to get anywhere on my own without having to wait for a cab while getting late for appointments, and I won't be bruising my legs on my scooter in hour long drives in horrible weather, which causes me so much more pain.(picture of the damage caused on my leg by my scooter, my skin is very fragile due my illnesses)During the COVID lockdown I couldn't take any cabs and was homebound. I'm also forced to rely on cabs in my social life too, which just takes away any chance at spontaneity.The government told me that they won't cover the costs of a Canta because according to them, physically, I don't ‘need’ it, but couldn't specify the exact requirements for a Canta.I am 23, a young woman. I am growing as a person, I do charity work and I try to be as positive of an influence as I can to people around me. My goal is just to be as independent as possible, and create a life worth living for myself. Thank you, for taking the time to read about me and my story.-------------------NEDERLANDS:Hallo,Mijn naam is Kelly, ik ben 23, en ik woon in Nederland.Ongeveer 10 jaar geleden merkte ik rare pijnen in mijn lichaam op, maar ik had mijn hele leven al last van problemen met mijn buik en darmen. Terwijl ik zieker en zieker werd, wist niemand wat er aan de hand was, maar ongeveer 3 jaar later kwam ik artsen tegen die gelijk wisten dat iets vreselijk mis was. Tijdens mijn diploma uitreiking voor de middelbare school kreeg ik de diagnose Ehlers Danlos syndroom, een bindweefsel ziekte, en later kreeg ik de diagnose Posturaal orthostatisch tachycardie syndroom (een stoornis die je hartrtime etc beïnvloedt) Deze ziektes zorgde samen voor heel veel pijn en ziek zijn.Ik wilde het leven echt opgeven, maar uiteindelijk begon ik meer hulp te vragen en begon ik ook een leven te ontwikkelen voor mezelf. Ik ben toen gaan revalideren om te leren leven met mijn ziekte, hierbij ontving ik ook een rolstoel en scootmobiel. Maar hier is waar ik jouw hulp nodig heb:Ik probeer echt een Canta auto te krijgen. Ik kan geen rijbewijs halen door mijn ziektes. Ik probeer zo onafhankelijk mogelijk te worden, ondanks al mijn ziektes en pijn. Ik probeer een leven voor mijzelf te creëren. De Canta auto zou mijn kwaliteit van leven heel erg verbeteren, omdat ik dan niet uren hoef te wachten op regiotaxis, te laat kom voor belangrijke afspraken hierdor, lange scootmobiel afstanden moet afleggen die mijn benen bont en blauw maken, ook bescherming heb onder moeilijke weer omstandigheden (door de kou krijg ik veel meer last van mijn gewrichten), en de ritten uitendelijk ook veel korter maken, waardoor ik minder pijn heb en minder vermoeid ben.(foto van mijn been na een scootmobiel rit, mijn huid is erg fragiel door mijn ziekte)Ook tijdens COVID kon ik niet met de regiotaxi en zat ik alleen maar thuis, wat erg negatief was voor mijn mentale toestand. Op sociale aspecten ben ik ook erg afhankelijk van taxis, waar spontaniteit compleet wordt weggehaald.De gemeente zei dat ik niet in aanmerking kom voor een Canta auto op fysieke basis maar kon mij niet vertellen wat je dan wel in aanmerking laat komen voor een canta.Ik ben 23, een jonge vrouw. Ik ben aan het groeien als persoon, ik doe vrijwilligerswerk en ik probeer een postieve invloed te zijn voor de mensen om mij heen. Mijn doel is echt om zo onafhankelijk mogelijk te zijn, en een leven te creëren voor mijzelf die het waard is om te leven. Dankje dat je de tijd hebt genomen om dit te lezenLink of the canta car

Growing up he taught me patience, he always supported me, and loved me no matter what I did. He is quite literally the best person I have ever known.On Tuesday, March 16, 2017 he walked himself into the ER after experiencing some confusion which we later discovered was due to having suffered a massive stroke. By Wednesday he was unable to walk, talk, or eat. After being in a coma for two weeks, he was moved to a rehab center for treatment where they attempted to help him regain his swallow and some of his motor abilities. Unfortunately, insurance only covers rehab for so long and he was eventually moved to long-term care. Since then, he has lived at the nursing home. For almost three years, my mom and I were at his side every day. We performed care ourselves, maintaining his physical and occupational therapy in an attempt to prevent further decline and to give him as good of a life as we could.2020 began as a hopeful year for him. We found a treatment facility offering hyperbaric oxygen therapy five minutes away from his nursing home. An absolute miracle as he struggles with long drives due to a mix of overstimulation intolerance and his inability to swallow. In January of 2020, he began his hyperbaric oxygen therapy five days a week, in which a bus came to pick us up and drove us to his treatments, we would do some exercises, and then the bus would drop us back at the nursing home. A roughly five hour trip in total. Things were looking promising for him.Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is used as a non-invasive treatment for strokes. The idea is to deliver oxygen at high pressure to increase the amount of oxygen carried by the blood to damaged areas, thus providing a greater opportunity for healing. HBOT offers benefits that include increased blood flow, encouragement of tissue regeneration, decreased inflammation, promotion of stem cell mobilization, aiding in fighting against infection, revitalizing mitochondria, and enhancing the body's natural ability to heal.Unfortunately, when COVID hit, we were forced to stop treatments and I was no longer allowed to visit him in the nursing home. I last saw him in March of 2020 and a month later, our worst nightmare occurred and he contracted COVID. I was convinced that this was it for my dad. I fell to my knees in despair not knowing if I’d ever see him alive again. The fear that we lived with for those few weeks were the worst of my life. But my dad is a fighter. He managed to survive COVID but has noticeably weakened since.My dad has been wheelchair bound for four years. He can’t enjoy his favorite meal, drink a sip or water, he can’t scratch an itch, but he’s in there. If I work for hours I can sometimes manage to get a smile out of him. My dad is 79 now. His condition is not well and his years are limited. But he is the best person I have ever known and the least deserving of such a sad circumstance. My ultimate goal is to bring my dad some comfort and quality to his final years of life. Unfortunately, there is no magic cure to his condition, but with the help of HBOT, I hope to bring him hope, allow him the possibility of being able to lift his arm to hold his wife's hand, the ability to remember his friends and family, an opportunity to watch his grandkids grow, watch me walk down the aisle, and even dabble with the possibility of him regaining a means of communication in any form.Our main obstacle is not driving two hours to take him to his appointments, getting his wheelchair on a bus, or coordinating a five hour trip for treatments five times a week. Our main obstacle is that each treatment costs $225. The recommended amount of treatments for maximum benefit is 40. If you have known my dad at all, you know him to be a wonderful person. An absolutely brilliant man, an avid book reader and lover of classical music. A master bird watcher who loves his wife, his kids, his grandkids, and his camera.If you can help at all in this journey, we as a family would be so beyond appreciative. Words cannot describe how badly I want to give my dad some of his life back and I would be so excited to share his growth with all of you.Read more"

A young 65 year old man, Dan realized what was happening and instructed the EMT’s that he was on blood thinners as he was rushed to the hospital, where they did not get the blood thinner message, and Dan’s bleed sent him into a coma. On that first night, Dan’s 25 year old daughter Katie flew home, and left behind her NY life to be Dan’s ferocious advocate and caregiver.
The doctors predicted that Dan would never wake from that coma, but Lea and Katie knew Dan’s tenacious spirit, and insisted on letting him fight his way back. When no one else believed in his ability to heal, they did.In June, two months later, Dan opened a single eye. By July, he was fully awake. He immediately displayed clear signs of complete cognition, and his unquenchable desire to fight hard against his condition was obvious. But Dan found himself in a body that was not going to make things easy. He was completely paralyzed, and speech was impossible. But the family figured out eye blinking codes to say “yes” and “no” and “I love you,.“ Since that moment, Dan has and fought tirelessly and methodically week by week to awaken one small body part at a time. A devoted meditator, Lea and Katie could see Dan use his meditative skills to build one muscle at a time, and then put the pieces together to achieve movements.When the doctors started to see what Dan COULD do, they all agreed that he needed immediate and consistent therapies: physical, occupational and speech therapy. But here is the catch 22 for ALL the families of serious aneurysm survivors: In facilities, they were told that Dan “did not qualify” for the minimal therapy that insurance offered, yet the facilities would not allow outside therapists. Any hope of getting Dan what he needed seemed out of reach.In what appeared to be a cruel turn of events, Dan’s hospital medicare allowance ran out at a time when all lesser facility beds were unavailable. Dan Lea and Katie were terrified when they were sent home to care for him, even though he was still on a tracheostomy. They had to hire round the clock caregivers. Self employed acting coach Lea started working 12 hour days seven days a week to pay for both them and most of the medical supplies. But steady therapy was still an impossibility.An emergency trip to a new hospital (Cedars Sinai) changed their lives A caring hospitalist told Lea and Katie about a concierge physiatrist who, for a price, would send wonderful therapists to the home. The price was beyond Lea’s reach, but she took out two more credit cards, and upped her work load to 14 hour days 7 days per week to pay the bills.It was worth it. Today, these amazing physical, occupational and speech therapists are working daily miracles in Dan’s life. Recovery is still slow, but it’s happening.Meanwhile, Lea and Katie continue to devote themselves entirely to Dan’s recovery and care. Katie has let her NYC apartment go, and spends her days and many nights as the full time head of Dan’s medical care, acting as a nurse, CNA, Respiratory Therapist, and Case Manager: helping to change him, turn him, tracking supplies, ensuring that he gets what he needs, feeding him, doing countless loads of laundry, and more. Until very recently, Lea has continued to work more than full time to get Dan the resources he needs.  (No. Government aid is not possible as long as Lea works so many hours to pay for care.)But now, in the past month, things have gotten harder. In April 2019, Lea went into the hospital. She has not been able to keep raising the crucial weekly funds for Dan’s care. Meanwhile, their landlord has decided to move back into their house (complete with eviction notice), so they have to pack up and move their 18 year residence along with Dan and all his equipment, ramps and supplies by the end of June.Dan and Lea have always been more interested in doing the right thing than in money. As a director and freelance university acting teacher, Dan has always put his students first. As an acting coach, Lea has always gone way beyond the usual to make sure that her students are getting what they need. Katie's unselfish devotion to her family shows her desire to be of service. Now they all need to ask for help.The family’s immediate goal is to pay their bills, and keep the therapies going long enough to get Dan well enough to continue his recovery in a rehab center. Their move will make it crucial for Lea to cut back on her work long enough to both heal and pack up the house.Again, Dan is working tirelessly to get his body to start doing those things that were taken for granted: moving his head from side to side, lifting a spoon from a plate to his mouth, and getting his swallowing mechanism to coordinate with that spoon. Making his vocal chords connect with his lips to make speech. Things that were never given any thought until that April night two years ago.The inspiration of Dan’s progress is matched only by his family’s unwavering spirit, but they need support to keep the momentum of Dan’s improvements going. The resources raised through this GoFundMe will cover Dan’s daily care, which works out to about $8000 per week. The care includes:·24 hour care givers (working alongside Katie/Lea)·physical, occupational and speech therapy (insurance pays for almost none when the doctors call it essential)·Medicines after deductibles - about $1200 per month·Medical transportation to and from doctor visits, hospital tests OR a used wheelchair van, so that they can start to transport him without the exorbitant costs of medical transport.·Diapers, wipes, creams, gloves, masks, special bandages, wound prevention, etc.·   Possible needs for speech and communication technologyPlease consider financially supporting this incredible family to restart their lives and help Dan continue his journey to recovery.

On May 14th, 2020, Andrea went into cardiac arrest. Her heart stopped for 34 minutes. She suffered an anoxic brain injury. So many tears have been shed for her. She had a beautiful life and then her heart stopped.Thankfully, that day Andee did NOT die. She has been a fighter Even when numerous doctors and nurses told our family that she had zero (0%) percent of recovery and that she would never wake up again. She would ""never open her eyes"", ""never say I love you"", ""never hug her children again."" Instead, Andrea has been fighting to come back to us every day. It has been a miracle, but the healing and growth still have a long way to go. Yes, she has defied odds but she is still not our Andee. So we need to keep up the prayers every single day for her continued recovery. And we thank you all for continuing to pray for her.Andrea has been in four hospitals; San Antonio Regional, Kindred, Meridian and Casa Colina, and we have been blessed with her insurance helping to cover the cost of her recovery. She has made remarkable progress over 5 months. It is a miracle. And we thank God daily! But her recovery has only just begun. We NEED money for continued therapy and rehab now.Andrea has not only WOKEN UP but she is mentally on her way back. She tells us, ""I LOVE YOU."" She constantly asks to talk to her children, her mother, and her boyfriend on facetime. She acknowledges friends and their well wishes. Her arms have movement. Her right leg has movement. But we know Andrea has the capacity to not only continue back mentally, but to be able to use her arms and legs, and walk again. She needs love and support to make that happen. She needs our help.Now, Andrea is fighting harder than ever, and we are being told that she will be ending her stay at Casa Colina and coming home. So we have a choice to pay for her continued recovery at Casa Colina or pay for her at home care. These bills will run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Our short term goal is for her to remain at Casa Colina, which is helping so much in her recovery, both mentally and physically. The first year after anoxic brain injury is so important, and she needs to have physical, speech and occupational therapy.So many loving and concerned friends have reached out to see how they can help. Prayers for Andrea's continued healing are still needed. Secondly, this fund is set up to cover a variety of practical health issues. Andrea is coming back to herself. So much love has been given to her, and she has love to give back. She still has a beautiful god-given life, just a different one now. Please help if you can. She needs us all.Jesus looked at them and said, ""With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."" - Matthew 19:26Read more"

I got a call a little after 9pm.... a phone call you never want... Your brother has been in a motorcycle accident and is being lifeflighted to Metrohealth. Steve was in a very very severe motorcycle accident on the first warm riding day of the year. He took his Harley out after work like he usually does on warm days to ride and decompress. His brand new Harley was his baby, and he He was on his way home about 8pm when he was riding eastbound. A F150 was riding westbound on the same road and turned left in the intersection directly in front of my brother giving him no time to react. Steve crashed right into the front passenger side of the F150 being ejected from his motorcycle. Steve sustained very serious but non-life threatening injuries which can only be explained by God. He underwent a 10 hour surgery to fix his right ankle, broken pelvis, bilateral broken wrists and forearms, and broken left elbow. He also have extensive lacerations on his face. We are firm believers that God and our guardian angel father were sitting on Steve's shoulder protecting him through this horrific accident. Although he is not out of the woods, as of now he has no noted brain injury, his spinal cord is intact and he has full function of his entire body and there is no internal bleeding. This is truly only explained by acts of God.He has a very very long and difficult road to recovery. Due to his pelvic injury, he will be non-weight bearing for 10-12 weeks. This means he will be on bedrest for an extensive period of time to let his pelvis heal properly. Right now he is a total care patient, unable to do anything for himself. Once the acute phase of recovery in the trauma intensive care unit is over, he will be moved to step-down and then we will be supporting him through inpatient rehab as he rehabs and and endures extensive physical and occupational therapy. He will need to learn how to walk again and regain his fine motor skills of his hands and wrists again. This means Steve will be out of work for a very very long time and as we all know he received the most expensive escort (life flight) to the hospital available, and care in the trauma intensive care unit is astronomically expensive. As well as rehab and all that is to come with his recovery.At this time I am asking for anything you feel in your heart to give in order to show Steve your support and help alleviate the financial burden that accompanies a traumatic experience like this. No amount is too little. If you cannot give financially, please keep Steve and our family in your thoughts and prayers as God moves mountains and works miracles through Steve.Read more"

Al had a crash which lead to him needing immediate medical attention. He was attended to very quickly and airlifted to Vancouver General Hospital. Upon arrival he was accessed right away and after only a few hours was in for surgery. Al sustained a break at the C5 vertebra. The 8 hour surgery went well and he is in ICU beginning his recovery. Doctors believe he should regain full use of arms and hands during the rehab process but for this injury the doctors say that most people don't regain use of their legs.

I met her when I was her nurse in the pediatric ICU when she was only a few months old. It would take entirely too long to tell her whole story, so I will give you an abridged version of the struggles she has endured for the 14 years she has been alive.Brianna was born with a brain tumor. She has never known life without this reality. The tumor she has, while not aggresive in nature, required surgery to remove as much of it as possible when she was a small infant. The location of the tumor meant that the surgeons could not remove all of it, and left irreversible damage to the fragile structures of her brain that were disrupted.She then underwent countless surgeries over the next decade to place, repair, replace, and troubleshoot the shunt in her brain that drained excess fluid away from her brain.When Brianna was only 5 years old, her father Jim died after a long courageous battle with a rare form ofperitoneal cancer.His death left Aimee (Brianna's mom) to raise and care for Miss B's many medical needs. A word about Aimee...this woman is one of the strongest humansI have ever met. She has been tireless inadvocating for Brianna, finding the bestmedicalcare for her daughter, balancingthe complex needs of a child with a brain tumor, and working in whatever capacity she can to provide for her. I frequently ask Aimee how she continues to fight so hard, how she gets up every day knowing that this is her reality...her response, ""I have no choice. I would, and will, do anything for Brianna."" In recent years, Aimee metJohn who loves Brianna as if she were his own. He has been a huge source of strength and support to his love, Aimee, and sweetMiss B.Thescary thing about brain tumors is that one never really knows how the body will respond asthe years pass. I always hoped that the first several terrible years were the worst for Miss B. That was not the case. Briannadeveloped a condition called Hypothalamic Obesity...herhypothalmus was damaged from the braintumor and she gains weight because of improper hormone and energy control from that area of the brain. It is refractory to diet and exercise, and she will continue to gain weight no matter what she does.Still not the worst of it. Brianna went from having some strange ""spells"" a few years ago, to having major, scary, untreatable seizures. She has had a Vagal Nerve Stimulator placed, has been on every medication possible, has been on a special diet, and has had numerous hospitalizations and tests to try and understand what was happening. These seizures are no longer scary and inconvenient...they are life threatening. Every seizure at this stage requires 911 and an ambulance to the hospital.Some days she has many seizures and there is a concern that they might not stop.Aimee has literally turned over every stone and asked every question. Seemingly the only option for Brianna right now...a plan that is not curative, butpalliative...involves major brain surgery to remove the parts of her brain causing the seizures. This will happen on both sides of her brain in the areas that have the most damaged areas. The outcome is uncertain, but will likely require rehab and many life changes for Brianna and Aimee. The hope is that her seizure activity will lessen significantly and allow her to enjoy her life more. Aimee is consulting with more doctors to see if there really is nothing else that can be done.I fell in love with Brianna when I cared for her in the hospital. I fell in love with Aimee and her late husband Jim, and admired how dedicated they were to their sweet sick baby. Brianna was a flower girl in my wedding, and I have remained close with her family. I sit here and wonder how I can help. How can anyone help in a situation like this? So I decided to create a fundraising page to try and help Aimee with the costs associated with having a very sick child, especially if major surgery is the next step...gas, tolls, housing, food, paying for things while sheis caring for Miss B and unable to work. I know money doesn't solve the problem, but will hopefully giveAimee fewer things to worry about so she can care for Brianna.*added to note that Brianna had another massive seizureyesterday at school and was taken to the hospital by ambulance. She is being admitted and the surgery could be happening sooner than expected*Please consider donating, even a small amount...I am firm believer that every little bit helps. No one deserves these challenges. No one. Please help Aimee and Brianna if you can. Thank you!Read more"

In 2016, my mom started noticing difficultly breathing and shortness of breath with everyday activities. Through two years of countless doctors’ visits, her condition worsened and she was finally diagnosed in 2018. Specialists at The University of Florida were able to diagnose my mom with a severe case of Bronchiolitis Obliterans: a rare, degenerative, inflammatory condition that affects the lung's tiniest airways, the bronchioles. The bronchioles become damaged and inflamed leading to extensive scarring that completely blocks the airways. She has been rapidly losing lung function since, and her disease is now considered end-stage.My mom has required oxygen for over 3 years now, and the disease has progressed to the point where oxygen support is no longer enough. It’s difficult to see my mom, who has been the main caretaker for our family, not be able to do so many of the things that she used to. Things as simple as walking up stairs, carrying our 2 year old sister, or walking across a room without struggling have become nearly impossible. Even basic self care, such as showering and brushing her teeth, is arduous. A common cold would send her to the hospital.This condition has no cure and the damage cannot be reversed. Her only treatment and chance for survival at this point is a double lung transplant. She has completed her week-long transplant evaluation (aka “hell week” as they say!), and the doctors have said the time is now—she cannot wait any longer. A double lung transplant is an extremely risky procedure with a long recovery period. She and my dad, Alex, will have to stay full-time in Gainesville for several months following the transplant, in close proximity to the UF Health Shands Hospital, while the rest of our family remains in Orlando. My dad will be her full-time caretaker. No one's transplant recovery is the same, and there is great potential for complications requiring extended hospital stays, inpatient rehab, or readmission. There are so many hidden costs such as temporary lodging, gas, food, parking and then the obvious medical costs of surgery, hospitalization, rehab, ongoing testing, and post transplant care living. Some of these expenses will be lifelong, such as the several prescription medications she will be required to take. Our hope is that this fund will support whatever is not covered by insurance and will help with the expenses while in recovery, including relocation funds.We are all hoping for a successful transplant and recovery, though we know the road ahead is not going to be easy or quick. My mom has never been comfortable asking for help, though she has always been willing to help and care for those around her. For her to open up about her health and reach out for help, I know she is at a point where this is her only hope. It has been heartbreaking to watch as this disease has stopped our mom from living life as her full, vibrant self. It’s still a shock to watch as she loses her breath while talking to us or suffers a coughing fit. She is the center of our family—we all love her so much and want to do whatever we can to help her. Thank you for your love, prayers, and support.Read more"

Kynslee's story is very, very long, but here is a condensed version.Kynslee was a happy, healthy 14 month old in April of 2016. On April 22nd she woke up without the use of her entire body. Over time she also lost the ability to eat, she has trouble swallowing, she has many seizures per day, swallowing just her saliva is difficult, she often gets sick and is susceptible to pneumonia and aspiration, she doesn't have most of her vision, cannot talk and still doesn't have use of her body, unable to even hold her head up.We have been to many, many hospitals starting with the ER at Spotsylvania Regional. We've also been to VCU, John Hopkins, Children's National, Children's of Philadelphia, Children's of Wisconsin and Kennedy Kreiger inpatient rehab facility.We're almost 2 years into this journey and not one of these hospitals has been able to tell us what happened to our daughter, how or if it can be ""fixed"" or where to go from here. What we do know is she has had every genetic test done that is available and they are all normal. Her brain has shrunk and she has white matter all over her brain, but no one knows why.Kynslee faces many struggles each day. She's currently on the ketogenic diet for seizures in addition to 2 seizure medications. At first the diet did wonders for the seizures, but now she continues to have many seizures a day. She's also on 2 reflux medications, but still spits up multiple times daily. In the future, she may need a procedure called nissen to prevent the spitting up as it can cause aspiration which is extremely dangerous for Kynslee. She recently had a sleep study done which revealed nothing except that her eeg is ""not normal"" (duh). She also had double hip surgery in March where they cut the tops of her femurs, put them back in socket and placed a screw and plate to hold them in place. She's been in a wedge for 6 weeks and getting her used to being without it is proving to be another struggle. In one year she'll need another surgery to remove the plate and screw. In total, Kynslee is on 8 medications multiple times a day and several vitamins and supplements.This life changing event has completely changed the lives of our entire family. While our 9 year old is an amazing brother filled with patience and love, it is still extremely hard for him. Dan and I are both working, but I have to take so much time off for appointments, hospital stays, etc. that I don't make very much and it's always a struggle to make ends meet.Right now we live day to day. We cherish the good days and even the smallest of milestones. Without knowing what the future holds we try our best to get through the bad days with grace and always advocate for the best care for our sweet angel.Your support means everything to us and we are forever grateful for your love and prayers.Read more"

Our dear friend Rick needs our help. On December 20th, Rick sustained a fall that resulted in a spinal cord injury which left him partially paralyzed. It has been an enormous challenge: physically, emotionally and now financially. He is currently in a rehab facility where he has been learning how to stand, walk, dress and feed himself again. Although he has progressed, he still has goals to meet and should remain there to get continued professional trained care to return home stronger, in a more independent state. Moreover, it would be inappropriate to require his family to assume these professional responsibilities. Unfortunately, as of February 16th, his insurance company is only paying 80% of his bill. Now, he is responsible for the remaining 20% for each day from that date. Rick and his healthcare team believe for him to have the best possible outcome, he should stay at the rehab until mid-March. This debt would pose a huge burden for him to carry on top of all else with which he is currently dealing. Additionally, there are other expenses he will likely incur when he returns home, i.e. homecare, physical therapy, equipment. Your generosity will have a lasting effect upon his physical recovery and be enormously helpful in minimizing the financial stress his continued recovery is likely to bring. Rick is deeply moved by the tremendous outpouring of love and support which you have all given so freely. Thank you.Read more"

Instead of celebrating another year, DeWayne was dealing with the beginning of this unusual medical journey. DeWayne had been experiencing severe migraines for an extended period of time. He and his wife, Jamey Rickard, visited with doctors and tried medications to help with the migraines that would last for days on end with no relief. Nothing worked. Eventually, DeWayne started experiencing waves of dizziness paired with confusion. At this point, Jamey took him to the ER where he was diagnosed as having had a stroke in the previous two weeks. With some relief of a diagnosis and possible solution to the issues he had been having, DeWayne started on a couple of different medications as well as mental/physical therapy to help him recover from the stroke. With no improvements, DeWayne was essentially forced into ""early retirement"" from the job he loved so much and a company that's like family to him. He then had to file for long term disability. A couple of months go by of Jamey and DeWayne waiting on approval for his disability. In July, Jamey was laid off from her job. Her job which was providing insurance for both herself and DeWayne. To say stress was at an all time high would be an understatement. At this point, DeWayne still had yet to be approved for disability, even with his company fighting hard for it to be approved for him, and now Jamey was out of a job as well. But, as always, the Lord provided and answered our many prayers and Jamey was offered a job. The only issue was that the location for the job was in San Antonio, TX. Through much prayer and discussion, they decided that the Lord opened this door for them so they were going to walk through it! The date was set for Jamey and DeWayne to be moved to San Antonio by September 7th. A new house was rented! The old house was packed up and loaded up to ship to San Antonio. Jamey and DeWayne were both having concerns again because DeWayne's health issues still had yet to improve and were actually getting worse. DeWayne was unable to help pack up very much because he was again having severe dizziness, confusion, short term memory loss, extreme fatigue and weakness, and even vomiting. On Friday, September 4th, DeWayne was so bad off that he could hardly get out of bed and stand on his own. Jamey called his doctor who informed her to take him to the ER immediately for fear that he may have had another stroke or was currently having a stroke. Jamey was finally able to get DeWayne to the hospital in Moultrie, GA where a CT and labs were run. When the CT came back, DeWayne was transported by ambulance to Archbold Hospital in Thomasville, GA. The CT showed heavy swelling and fluid build up in the ventricles of his brain. The plan was for DeWayne to be evaluated by Neuro Surgeon at Archbold and probably rushed into surgery to place a shunt to remove pressure from his brain. Once DeWayne arrived at Archbold, many tests, CTs and labs were run. The results from the many, many tests that were run came back and it was discovered that DeWayne had Cryptococcal Meningitis. The doctors believe there never was a stroke and that the C. Meningitis was the issue from the start, and it had just been smoldering inside him all this time. Hence, no improvement and worsened conditions since initial stroke diagnosis in February. This form of meningitis is rare for all to contract, but especially rare because it normally would affect someone with a weakened immune system, like someone with AIDS or cancer. Neither of which DeWayne has.Now, the current situation is, thanks to your many prayers and the Lord's Will, DeWayne has started to improve!!! PRAISE THE LORD!!!!As of Wednesday, 9/23/20 - day 19 in the hospital - 3:00 pm update.*PT used the standing machine thing and though he wasn’t able get fully stood up - he was able to put some weight on his legs, for a few seconds, four different times. They also got him transferred over to the chair, where he has been for a few hours. Holding up his head really good - better arm control, better core control!!*got the staples out of his head from where the external drain was!*got the NG/Silk tube out - no more need for water push - sodium is good! *starting last IV bag of potassium*allowed to have a cup of coffee!*lumbar puncture done yesterday and early results show no cryptococcal meningitis infection. There are still some ‘bugs’ in the fluid but it looks good and they feel it will clear itself up as time goes on. Protein in the fluid is showing high - should be at 45 and it’s at 350. also, white blood cells should be at 10 and are at 60. *he’s been awake all day except for a short nap after his bath this morning but he has not napped since PT - which is big - he’s getting stronger!We could not be more happier with his small, yet, significant improvements. The doctors are now discussing moving DeWayne into In-Patient Rehab. We have already found a doctor and a In-Pateint Rehab facility in San Antonio, TX. We really need to have DeWayne transferred to Texas for this next step for many reasons. The biggest reason is so Jamey can start her new job, which they have currently held for her since September 14th! The sooner Jamey can go back to work, the sooner they will have affordable insurance again, as well as income coming into their household.This is where the donation page comes in. I set this page up for DeWayne and Jamey Rickard to try and raise money to help cover the cost of all the medical expenses and transportation. I am asking you to please give what you can. With DeWayne and Jamey's faith and determination, they will make it through this situation. And being surrounded by family and friends that care so much for them and have lifted them up in prayer so many times, I know they will get through this. So whether you can give or not, I ask that you please pray for Dewayne and also for Jamey and his family, that really is the best that anyone can do!Thank you for all your prayers and donations!Read more"

Joseph Flavill, a very close friend of mine and many others, has been in hospital since March 1st 2020 following a road accident which has resulted in a serious head injury. Joe is sport mad! He loves going to the gym, skiing and surfing- his dream is to go to Bali next year for 3 months on the trip of a lifetime to get his surf instructor qualifications. However he is never happier than when wearing his Barton Hockey Club shirt and playing for the Men’s 1st team. Joe’s family and friends are desperate to see him back with his cheeky smile on his face again, and doing the things that he loves. Starting on May 18th, I am going to be cycling 200km in 7 days to hopefully raise some money, that will go towards physio and other support for Joe and his family to try and speed up his long rehab journey. All money raised will be going to support Joseph’s Journey, an initiative being set up by his family which will be launched in the summer, which will give more opportunities to support Joe.Thank you!Sophie

On the 29th June 2019 my brother Jeff (aged 38) suffered a stroke. He was alone working at his yard on cars like he always was. Thankfully somehow he managed to get himself to a point where he could be seen & an ambulance was called. He was then flown by air ambulance to Kings Hospital in London and put onto life support, where he spent the next few months in intensive care and the journey that followed is just unimaginable. 

After he had been assessed and scans were done we were told by the consultants that Jeff had suffered a catastrophic brain stem stroke. It is very rare (1% chance) of anyone becoming “locked in” with this type of Stroke and our Jeff being 1 in a Million, unfortunately was confirmed as having Locked In Syndrome. Jeff defied the consultants and fought his way out of intensive care at Kings. He was placed onto a less intrusive stroke ward and awaited a bed to become available at our local hospital. During his stay he ended up back in intensive care a couple of times, we almost lost him on a few occasions but Jeff came fighting back. Eventually Jeff was transferred to an amazing team at QEQM who weaned Jeff from his tracheostomy and gave us hope and encouragement, he stayed with them through many complications over the coming months moving from ward to ward depending on his circumstance at the time. He contracted infection after infection but still defied consultants and carried on fighting. Jeff was given daily physiotherapy to help which in turn helps his mental health. 

Only being able to move his eyes up and down, Jeff had no way of comunicating at the beginning. A Spell Board was created as Jeff can only move his eyes up and down (up for Yes, down for No) and finally we were able to start communicating and asking questions he could answer. This was such an amazing breakthrough.

Then Covid-19 hits…… It became rife in all our local hospitals.  We fought for Jeff to be able to come home as we felt this was the safest place for him to be, as he was so susceptible to contracting Covid. This was denied by the medical profession,at first due to his needs, but just in the nick of time, the NHS pulled through and allowed him home on the condition his wife (Sarah) cares for him. Jeff has wonderful carers 3 times a day, and his amazing wife has been by his side 24/7. The main issue now is that Jeff only receives the physio that Sarah has been trained to carry out. 

Whilst Jeff was in hospital he was given physio on a bike. This bike is amazing. It pick’s up any movement that Jeff may be trying to work against it. You could tell when Jeff had finished on this bike, it tired him 20 minutes on the bike is like running a marathon), his muscles had been exercised andhis mental health improved. He is desperately missing this piece of equipment and we want to get his Journey with locked in syndrome back on Track.

Jeff will remain at home until Covid is over, he will then go to rehab to support him whilst his house is adapted to have him home permanently. We want to be able to access any form of equipment we can to help Jeff carry on his fight at home especially one of these bikes. This equipment is expensive, with a remodel of a house and now being down to a single income we wanted to see if we could raise some money towards the cost. 

Our target is £7,000 which is approx. the cost of the Physio Bike. Please, donate if you are able to and become part of Jeff’s Journey with LIS. 



Thankyou from all Jeff’s Family.

You know the song by John Lennon and Paul McCartney right? I need a little help from my friends for another friend, George Jackson, III. I have known this man since the 90's and I consider him not a friend but FAMILY. George has suffered a medical crisis and is in need of financial assistance. George is fighting for his life. Before I go there, let me tell you a little about Mr. Jackson. His passion is teaching. His passion is kids. His background includes Director of Multi-Cultural Student Affairs, Coordinator of Diversity Affairs and Substitute Teacher-Special Education which is his current role. George suffers from kidney disease which forced him to apply for Social Security Assistance but still have the ability to continue to work but only part-time. He has been on the kidney donor list it seems like FOREVER. He does everything right but can't seem to get a break. His faith is unwavering and his PRIDE runs deep which is why I am starting this Go-Fund-Me page. George recently suffered a set back where he blacked out at home causing injury to his face, mouth and arms. He has developed blood clots in both forearms and has been diagnosed with syncope (temporary loss of consciousness caused by a fall in blood pressure). That was 2-weeks ago and this week he was moved to a rehab center. If all of the things I have described were not enough, he is also in the midst of defending his Social Security Benefits due to a paperwork error on their part. Did I mention, his FAITH is unwavering? He continues to be positive, upbeat and concerned for others and their well-being. My goal is to raise a minimum of $5,000 in the hopes of exceeding that number. With everything going on in the world today, I know there are many without work, wondering where their next meal will come from and whether or not bills will get paid but I am hoping you can see someway of contributing whatever you can. There is always someone in greater need than ourselves.Funds raised will go towards medical expenses, rent, food and day to day needs. I thank and appreciate you all.Read more"

This is for my good friend Baron Li and his family. This is their story…On Friday July 10th, as Baron was leaving to go to work, someone started shooting at him. The assailant shot more than 10 times, hitting Baron with NINE bullets, six of which were at point blank range. Baron was rushed to the hospital and underwent a long surgery to remove two of the four bullets that got lodged in his body. The other two are too dangerous to remove and will remain. Kiro News Story about shootingBaron is so lucky to have survived this encounter. Things could have turned out worse! It is unknown who attempted to kill him and the police are investigating. He has a long road to recovery and needs a sense of safety and security for he and his family so he can focus on recovery. His right arm is shattered because it was hit multiple times as he tried to shield himself. He will need future surgeries to repair it. He will also need a hip replacement. The future medical costs are unknown and he is still in the hospital recovering. He is on unpaid leave from his company, which has raised a huge concern over how he will afford his medical expenses as well as his everyday expenses.Baron’s young son Arik has Dystonia and Kernectirus and requires 24/7 care. Baron recently won full custody of Arik from his ex-wife. His wife, Didee, has been providing constant care for Arik. Unfortunately, since the shooting, Arik has been placed in respite care so that Didee can support Baron. Without Didee’s income as a care giver, or Baron’s income from his job, there could come a time where Baron will lose custody of Arikbecause he can’t provide the adequate environment for Arik.All donations will be used to help Baron and Didee with medical bills, any rehab Baron will need as well as every day expenses until Baron can resume working. Any little bit will help. If you are not in a position to help out, prayers for him are welcome. Thank you with all of my heart,Susie Pietz on behalf of Baron Li and Family#HelpforBaronRead more"

Brendan was immediately transferred to McLaren Oakland Hospital for further testing and supportive care. Over the course of the next 48 hours Brendan’s health rapidly declined, his organs began shutting down and by Sunday morning he was intubated as he was unable to breath on his own. The team of ICU doctors at McLaren decided that Brendan was too sick for them to care for as his condition became critical and life threatening. He needed to be transferred to a larger and more specialized hospital. Brendan was airlifted to U of M on Sunday evening and admitted to their Surgical Intensive Care Unit to be treated by the best team for his condition. Upon his arrival at U of M he was put on continued dialysis for acute kidney failure, continued on the ventilator to breath for him, received treatment for a very rare condition that lead to necrotizing pancreatitis, was put on antibiotics to treat sepsis, and began being closely monitored for other serious complications throughout his body. Doctors are still trying to figure out the root cause of Brendan’s illness as he continues to receive treatments and is being monitored by several teams of doctors in the SICU and other specialty units in the hospital.His care team has stressed that Brendan and his family have a long road ahead that will have bumps along the way. He is expected to be in the hospital for month/s followed by extensive rehab. During this time both Chelsea and Brendan are unable to work. We are hoping this will help alleviate some of the financial burden due to medical expenses and the loss of income from being out of work.

The owner told the veterinarian that he “was given Peanut three months earlier as a gift”. Peanut was unable to walk, in pain, terrified, but very sweet and docile. The owner stated that his roommate went on a rampage and beat Peanut, aggressively punching him multiple times. This is an 8 lbs., 2 year old dog. Felony charges have been filed against the roommate.Peanut had severe neurologic deficits: proprioceptive deficits in both rear limbs and left front limb, a hairline fracture on his pelvis, and general pain. This poor boy was unable to walk without significant assistance. He would take two steps and completely fall to his side, unable to get up. Peanut was shaking in pain and fear, but he licked his new vet friends and crawled in their laps for safety. He was so thankful to be somewhere he felt safe.Peanut’s owner was unable to provide any financial support to help with treatment, diagnosis, or even general healthcare, so he surrendered him to Take Paws Rescue. When scanned, this boy’s microchip was related to an entirely different owner. Take Paws Rescue contacted this previous owner, who finally responded after 36 hours. This sweet baby’s name was actually Buddy! She admitted that Buddy had gotten out a few times, was mainly an outside pet, and that he even ended up in her local shelter, where he stayed for a month!!! POOR GUY!She had no evidence (or veterinarian for us to contact) to show that she had EVER vetted him and the only care he received was at the shelter where he was vaccinated, neutered, and chipped.The shelter made her “readopt” him!But her lack of care and neglect continued and Buddy once again escaped in January. (Which lines up with the timing the second owner was “given him as a gift”.) Needless to say, she surrendered him as well, because she did not have the ability to care for him.We knew with Buddy's symptoms that spinal cord injury was likely. A specialist prescribed strict kennel rest and steroids along with pain meds to attempt conservative therapy. He said that if significant changes didn’t occur in 72 hours to recheck and consider a cat scan. Buddy improved slightly as far as neurologic deficits were concerned, but his pain became worse each day. He cried out randomly (likely due to the spinal chord trauma present). When Buddy did not improve, a cat scan was preformed. Buddy has a cervical extruded disk (C4-C5). The vet recommends surgical spinal cord decompression by ventrical slot. His prognosis is excellent. With surgery, Buddy will recover and have a wonderful life. We need your help! This is an expensive surgery, but even with a rescue rate, we need to quickly raise $2500 to help Buddy. He cannot live with this injury and this pain. There is no good alternative. This darling dog will have to be put to sleep without this surgery.This boy has been repeatedly let down by humans and severely abused. Buddy is such a special dog. He is nothing but pure sweetness. His first owner neglected him and his second owner did not protect Buddy from severe physical abuse. Neither of them provided any veterinary care. Yet, Buddy shows no resentment or anger towards people; he only want to be held and snuggle but that is what he does. He is also completely house trained, good with dogs and kids. He approaches everyone with love. Please consider donating to Buddy's surgery fund. He is worth saving. Read more"

She is currently in the National Rehab Hospital, adjusting to life in a wheelchair. Work has just begun on the house to make it suitable for a wheelchair user, and we are looking for funds to make this happen as comfortably and stress-free as possible.In September 2020, our wonderful Mum felt a pain in her back one day and was whisked off in an ambulance the next, unable to walk or even feel anything below her waist. She has spent the time since in recovery, working incredibly hard, gaining strength and adapting to her new lack of mobility. The hospitals and rehab have been amazing in helping her with this new reality of being in a wheelchair full-time. We have all been surrounded with so much love, support and prayer, from friends, family and our church community. She feels very well cared for and her faith in God is as strong as ever. This means so much and we are eternally grateful. We know that what the future holds will be different with many new adventures and challenges but we know she is cared for, loved and trusts in the plan God has for her. The reality now is that we want to get Mum home. We cannot do that until our family home gets a lot of essential work, being remodeled to comfortably and permanently fit this new way of life for both Mum and Dad. Doorways need to be widened, ramps need to be installed, walls need to be knocked though, kitchen counters need to be lowered, and that is just the start of it. As this is such a huge adjustment, we as their daughters, along with other close friends and family in our community, want to make this transition home as stress-free as possible for our parents who have done so much for us. We are aiming to raise funds to take away some of the stresses that will come with this next challenge, this next step in getting Mum and her new wheels moving back home. Funds raised will be used for the essential building work as well as other necessities and comforts to make their home the best possible space to accommodate a wheelchair and its careful (we hope) driver.

Our beloved Wise Family needs our help right now. On Tuesday, October 13, Jaimee Wise suffered from a ruptured brain aneurysm while she was at home playing with two, out of three, of her young children.Luckily, her 9-year-old son recognized that she was having a medical emergency and was able to get help to her quickly. She received the best care possible by the first responders, as well as the nurses, techs, doctors, and surgeons at the hospital, but Jaimee is still unresponsive and in very critical condition. Jaimee is known to be a “fighter” and has already survived TWO very traumatic and premature deliveries. We are still hopeful for a full recovery but understand that she will be in the ICU for at least another 3 weeks.Many of you have been kind and asked how you can help. As you can imagine, the road to recover, and everything that goes along with it, is very expensive.In addition to possibly having to make some major home renovations and purchase any necessary medical equipment, Jaimee’s husband, Josh, will be responsible for hospital bills, rehab bills, medical transportation costs, home health care, and more. (Josh has dedicated the last 13 years to serving our community as a firefighter/EMT for the Arlington County Fire Department.)We all want to help make sure Jaimee receives the very best of care and has every possible resource available to her to help with her recovery and quality of life.So, we believe the best way we can do that right now is to help alleviate the financial stress this has put on them.

Let’s show Jaimee and the Wise Family that they are not alone and how much she is loved by her family of friends! Whatever you can give will be greatly appreciated and every dollar will be used to assist with whatever needs come up: medical, at home, for the kids, etc.#TeamJWStrong

Hello friends and family. I’m starting this go fund me on behalf of my sister in law Cynthia.

My brother Jd was admitted into the hospital due to complications from Covid. He was under sedation for about a week to help his body heal. Unknowingly he pulled his tube out in which the doctors said instead of putting it back they would leave him back on just oxygen. It’s been a couple days and he’s been transferred from the ICU to a normal room. He’s showing great improvement with his oxygen levels and his rehab to help him walk again and get his strength back. Prior to being hospitalized, my brother was diagnosed with Sleep Apnea and required a machine to help him sleep at night. Cynthia was informed he would be able to return home but the doctors won’t release him until he’s able to purchase a stronger sleep apnea machine and a oxygen tank. Of course insurance is covering some cost but his out of picket cost would be 1,000. Cynthia says any help is greatly appreciated and she just had the green light toreturn back to work after testing positive a couple weeks ago which led to both of them not working. Any help is greatly appreciated and God will surely bless you in return! Again Jd would like to thank everyone for their prayers and support! God bless everyone and in good health!

After failing the physical exam a few days later, the physicians have anticipated that he stays a minimum of 15 to 20 days at the rehab facility to undergo physical therapy. When Charlie found out that the physicians are requiring him to miss work and reside in a rehab facility; his first concerns were the amount of time he will be missing work, medical expenses, financial expenses, and his family’s well-being.

She needs our support. Please read on for details, and if you are able, please contribute.Marty is a vivacious 75 year-old dancer who discovered flamenco later in life through DTES community flamenco classes. She quickly found her passion and once she met Oscar, that was it: she became a part of the Mozaico Flamenco community. She was a core part of Barrio Flamenco over its 7 years at the DTES Heart of the City Festival (as shown in the cover photo), and has danced and sang in the coro for Mozaico student shows, while taking classes with many much-loved teachers. She gets out to Kino whenever she can, and last year, hosted her 75th birthday party there.While at a bus stop early in March, practicing a turn for Sevillanas, Marty fell and broke her hip and wrist. She is recovering well at a rehab facility. However, in the meantime, she is facing some difficult issues and unexpected costs that put her housing and health further at risk. This is made even more uncertain by the current COVID-19 crisis. Marty has always been incredibly self-sufficient. Her family are not nearby and I don't know what other networks of support she has available.She would be so touched and grateful to know she has the support of the flamenco community in her time of need.While not sharing all the details out of respect for her privacy, Marty is on some housing waiting lists. In the meantime and during this interim period, some of the things Marty will need support with are (in order of importance and priority of how the funds will be used):- Costs related to restoring her rental apartment to a healthy and safe living environment, not covered by the landlord or insurance (this has been checked into)- The cost of replacing some of her household items- Taxis or other transportation while she is unable to take the bus and to protect her from COVID-19.- Costs toward a basic phone or laptop so that she can connect to the internet from home, especially given the need for isolation/physical distancing- Other unforeseen costs.Thank you for thinking of Marty and providing whatever support you can for her during this challenging time.Much love and OLE!Read more"

As most of you probably know by now, Cory Frye suffered a stroke on March 8, 2020. After a week in the hospital followed by a brief brush with freedom, Cory had to return to the facility in Corvallis and has been entertaining them with his charms for a couple of weeks now.

There is still no clear answer in when he is going to be sprung from the joint, and there is still rehab ahead. I’m sure you can imagine what weeks of inpatient stroke recovery care cost in our system.

Cory has such a kind heart for his fellow humans, and it would be wonderful to be able to support him at this time. (Especially as he can no longer have visitors due to virus precautions).

I would love to be able to wrap up with an obscure music or Marx Brothers reference but it would never be worthy.

Please donate if you can. Leave him a note of clever well wishes. Pass along the link far and wide.

On the 30th of March 2020, James went in for surgery, although despite the surgeons’ best efforts, it did not go as planned. James experienced intracerebral haemorrhagic strokes.We were not given a great outcome as to James’ future but he has defied the odds and is now able to think, learn, talk, eat, and drink normally.

As is the case with many strokes, this came out of the blue and was totally unexpected. Megan was 43 years old (she has since had a birthday), in good health, and a vibrant person who loved life -- especially her family and friends. In the 24 hours following the stroke, she underwent two life-saving surgeries to relieve the swelling in her brain. In one of the surgeries, doctors removed almost half of her skull to allow her brain to expand. Megan spent over two weeks in the neuro ICU at Brigham & Women’s Hospital and a few days on a medical floor there. She spent 7 weeks at Spaulding Rehab in Cambridge and is currently rehabbing at CareOne in Lexington.Mighty Meg, as she has come to be known, has made great progress in the months since her stroke. She has worked incredibly hard at her PT, OT, and speech therapy -- but she has a very long road ahead of her. She is still unable to move her right side, and her speech and communication have been significantly impaired by the stroke. As you can imagine, she gets frustrated sometimes, which breaks our hearts. She also still faces another surgery down the road to replace the portion of her skull that was removed.At this time, we still don’t know Meg’s long-term recovery prognosis. While we are grateful for the progress she has made and consider every small improvement a victory, but she has a very LONG road ahead of her. Her care team has told us that even at her best, Megan is going to need a lot of assistance and support when she finally goes home, much of which isn’t likely to be covered by insurance. She obviously hasn’t worked since the stroke, which has significantly impacted her income. We’ve started this GoFundMe to raise funds to help Megan’s family as she continues on her journey to recovery. We invite you to contribute and support Megan during this difficult time.Megan is an Applied Behavior Analyst (ABA) for Accept Education Collaborative. She works with elementary aged Autistic and other special needs children in the Medway school system and absolutely LOVES her job. Her students all adore ""Ms. Megan"" and she considers all of them a special light in her life! She worked extremely hard to earn her Bachelors Degree from Northeastern University; working her full time job and bartending at night on top of studying to graduate with honors in order to perform the job that she loves to the best of her ability.Anyone who knows Megan knows that she is the sweetest, most loving, caring, and amazing person in the world, and she’d do anything for anyone. We are so grateful for all of the love, prayers, and support Megan’s friends have shown her and us.

My family and I met him and his wife, Tina, about 14 years ago at Kerr lake. We immediately became great friends and have enjoyed every minute of our friendship since.FAMILYBruce and Tina have been married for 41 years. They have a daughter, Tracy, which has gave them 4 wonderful and energetic grandbabies. The oldest is Madison 5, then Harper 3 and 10 month old twins, Corbin and Leah. They are very much the apple of grandpa’s eye!THE JOURNEYBruce was diagnosed with IPF (IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS) in 2016 after his 2nd rotator cuff surgery. The doctors seem to think theIPFsurfaced from the nerve block medication they gave him during surgery. It temporary paralyzed part of his lung. He had difficulty breathing after the surgery. So test were done to determine that he did haveIPF.THE 2ND ATTACKERAbout a year into his journey with IPF,Bruce was diagnosed withCOPD.At this point he had 2 things attacking his lungs and making breathing and everyday things almost impossible. The IPFmade the lungs harden and not let oxygen into the bloodstream. TheCOPDwas compounding his ability to breathe.LIFE BEFORE IPF & COPDBefore IPF & COPD, Bruce was an avid outdoorsman and sportsman. He loved hunting, fishing and being the best grandpa possible. He was always there for anyone that needed help or needed something fixed. We call him our "" Macgyver"". He could do anything from sewing to refurbishing an entire boat and everything in between. But he is so much more to us. He is our forever friend.THE LONG ROAD AHEADNow he spends his days hooked to oxygen 24/7, in and out of hospitals and traveling to Duke rehab 5 days a week with his wife. While at rehab, he does exercises to keep him strong for his transplant. They also attend classes when they go to learn what to do and what to expect before and after transplant. They have been doing this since September 19th and the plan is for him to continue this until he gets his transplant.They called Bruce and Tina on September 28th and said they had a set of lungs for him. I was so excited! They packed up and drove to Duke only to find out the lungs were not a match. This absolutely broke my heart. I can only imagine how they felt.LIFE AFTER TRANSPLANTOnce he gets his transplant he will spend at least 3 months in the hospital. Then when he gets out, they will have to live within 30 mins of the hospital. So, that means renting a place to stay and utility bills. They will stay here 3-6 months, depending on how he does.THE COSTAs everyone knows, this has been and will be very expensive. The trips back and forth to Duke everyday, Tina missing work, renting a place close to the hospital to stay, utilities, post medicines, medical supplies, medical bills, gas, food, rehab, and most expensive, the anti rejection medicines he will have to be on the rest of his life. Tina has checked on the cost of the medicines after transplant and one of his anti rejection meds will run around $800 a month after insurance has paid.HOW YOU CAN HELP!Bruce is not only a husband, a father, an awesome grandpa and dear friend...He is a special man that has spent his life helping others. I hope you can find it in your heart to help a man that has helped so many. No amount is too small. Any amount you are willing to give will be greatly appreciated. Most of all, keep him and his family in your prayers. We know our Lord Jesus has Bruce in his loving care. Jesus said..... ""For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them"" Mathew 18:20Please feel free toSHARE, SHARE, SHAREto your social media and tag your friends!WORDS FROM BRUCE""Without GOD and the prayers I have received so far, I don't know where I would be right now. It is a struggle for me to just go to rehab daily and do the things they ask of me. It is hard for me to ask for help. I have always been a one man band. But, I have come to realize I do need help. I want to see my grandbabies grow up and be able to share all of their special moments with them. I want to do all the grandpa things that grandpas are supposed to do.

He is an amazing man and needs your help & support at a very difficult time for his family!￼Jeff and his wife, Cheri were married September 1988. They have been married almost 28 years. They are southern California natives, but now live in Gilbert, Arizona. Early in their marriage, they struggled with infertility issues, but wanted nothing more than to become parents and to raise a family. They tried everything. After failed medical procedures and much heartache, they chose the miracle of adoption! After years of adoptions falling through, they relied on their faith and prayer, and they were finally blessed with their daughter, Alyssa. She was born on their 7th wedding anniversary in September 1995. Life was wonderful and they were parents at last! Their lives were just beginning and they looked forward to many happy years to come!￼As fate would have it, those happy days were short lived and were replaced with shock and uncertainty of what their future would now hold. When Alyssa was still a baby, only a year old, Jeff had a catastrophic event take place that landed him in a coma and fighting to survive. He had warning signs prior to this and tried seeking medical help, but his doctor felt nothing was wrong and told his wife not to worry. October of 1996, he was rushed unconscious to the hospital, into emergency surgery, and was in the hospital for the next 9 months, facing a very life threatening situation. There were many complications that resulted and it was touch and go for quite some time. It was discovered that Jeff had a very rare type of brain tumor called a pilocytic astrocytoma, growing deep inside his brain, which they believed was there since birth. This rare AV Malformation is a conglomeration or tangling of blood vessels that had slowly built up pressure over the years and resulted in a large hemorrhage into the brain stem and also the cerebellum. (The outcome is similar to a severe stroke.) The doctors gave him no hope to survive. If he did live, he would remain a vegetable. (Fortunately, the tumor was benign) Jeff defied all odds and lived through surgery after surgery, neglect and mistakes by hospital staff, failed surgeries, setbacks, deadly infections, but had a will to live to raise that daughter he waited so long for and to rejoin his family! He was transferred to two more hospitals over time, which eventually would help save his life. Cheri stayed by his side and never gave up on him! His siblings, in-laws, family members, and so many friends were there for him during his time of need. His parents had already passed away and as of now, Jeff has lost both his in-laws, all too young.Jeff eventually came out of his coma, and had to re-learn everything he'd ever known, all over again. Walking was not one of those things however, and he was now facing life partially paralyzed, in a power wheelchair with many new obstacles to overcome. It was a time of loss, acceptance, transition, and dreaming new dreams. He perservered and never gave up. Days, weeks, and months of therapy and rehab followed. He worked hard and progressed more than doctors originally thought, but he only regained some of his abilities and function back. He has had situations that have placed him back in the hospital over the years, one even this last summer, when his shunt became clogged. His hopes and dreams of having a large family and supporting them with his accounting degree was not to be. The once very independent man now relied on others for complete help. He has been left with many deficits and life is difficult. He is hemi-plegic, which means he only has use of the left side of his body. He has ataxia, tremors, vision & speech difficulties, and his gross & fine motor skills were also affected, along with a host of other things. Thankfully, his cognitive function remained in tact. Jeff is a living miracle! His family roots helped him be the strong man he has turned out to be today, despite the things he's endured and will continue to face the rest of his life. ￼Jeff has lived with his disability now for nearly twenty years, and to this day, has never complained once. He is just thankful to be alive and happy that he was able to help raise Alyssa, along with his wife. He loves Cheri and Alyssa very much! They have been by his side since the beginning and are still there for him, each and every day. Cheri originally had the option of placing Jeff in a nursing facility or bringing him home to care for him. She chose to bring him home, because she said, that is where she felt he belonged... with his family! Jeff's faith is strong. They have always relied on the power of prayer. He believes in a loving Heavenly Father and Savior, Jesus Christ. He has faced many losses in life, but he remains very positive and is an example to so many!￼Jeff tries to stay active and enjoys going out with his family and friends to the movies, ball games and out to eat. He attends church each week and hates to ever miss. For the past 14 years, he has used a special wheelchair accessible ramp van that Cheri drives their family in. It is their only vehicle. But with age, it has had many expensive repairs and once again, is broken down. It is now at the point where they cannot afford to repair their van this time around. This is Jeff's only means of transportation and he is not able to leave his home now to go ANYWHERE. Not even to his Dr. Appointments. Cheri has always worked to try and make ends meet to provide for their family over the years. However, right now she is unemployed and Jeff requires more care at home, so that is her priority, as his wife and caregiver. She and Jeff hate more than anything, I know, to ask for help. Financial struggles seem to keep popping up for them and they don't know where to turn anymore. A new accessible van would be a huge load off their plate and being able to rely on something most take for granted, would be such a blessing to their family. Let's help get Jeff back out doing the things he loves, with his family and friends in a vehicle he can travel in and rely on!￼If you would like to help Jeff, by donating to a new accessible van, I know he would be very grateful!We are hoping you will share this with friends and family via social media and email... the quicker we can get Jeff back to ENJOYING LIFE, the better! He has upcoming Dr. appointments that he does not want to miss. A brand new accessible van is not cheap. They are roughly $50,000-$60,000. (Double the price of a typical van) The goal is $40,000 for a used one, so remember to please SHARE this with your friends, family, business/co-workers. :)* I know that Jeff would, in no way want this to be a burden on anyone and no amount is too small. Thank you for your love and support! It means so very much!￼Read more"

Elijah is a student at Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, AZ. He was to complete his graduation in December 2020. But something happened to Elijah that is changing his goal of graduating and becoming a part of the medical field. Here is his story:On November 20, 2020 we received word that Elijah had to go to the Emergency Room. His legs wouldn’t hold him up and he was not able to get up. He did not know what was happening to him. His sister, Morgan was there in Phoenix as they were going to drive back together to Albuquerque, NM for the holiday. Instead Elijah had to be driven to the ER in Phoenix, AZ.Elijah entered the hospital as an emergency patient. Tests were administered to determine what was happening to him. He had CT scans, MRI, lab work. Finally he had an imaging test which resulted on his diagnosis of Cavernous Hemangioma. The doctors found three of these Cavernous Hemangiomas. There is one on the frontal lobe of the brain. The one on the frontal lobe cannot be removed because it’s on the brain. The two on the back of his neck were surgically removed (a seven hour surgery). One of the two on the back of his neck was causing him not able to walk or move.Elijah is in the Intensive Care Unit and will remain there until the doctors can release him to the Rehab Center in Phoenix, AZ. He is unable to move his muscles in his body. He currently has Pneumonia and not able to breath on his own. This is long term care. Funds raised will help his family financially for Elijah's medical care which will require constant care. We ask for prayers and any donation you can give.Read more"

We've launched The Herbfarm's Patreon page so you can contribute monthly until the COVID-19 crisis ends. There are also great rewards there too.Where can I watch interviews with The Herbfarm staff? Interviews are available hereor on YouTube.Where can I see all the photos from The Herbfarm and meal deliveries?You can view photo albums here.How can hospitals contact you to sign up for these free meals? Great, email us at [email redacted] — we should have a phone number set up in the near future.Is there a way for me to provide ongoing support? Yes! We've launched The Herbfarm's Patreon page so you can contribute monthly until the COVID-19 crisis ends. There are also great rewards there too.Why does each meal cost $25? Due to the infectiousness of COVID-19 and risks to medical caregivers, the meals must be individually boxed. The hospitals are not accepting ""family style"" shared dishes. Furthermore, as personal protection equipment (PPE) is limited, caregivers must spend hours in protective gear without eating. When they finally get a break and get to remove the gear, they are dehydrated and hungry. Our full course meals meet their immediate needs and help them feel supported by our community.Who are the volunteers and what do they do? Carl Coryell-Martin and Patrick Halstead came up with the idea and worked with Ron and Carrie at The Herbfarm to jumpstart meal delivery. They along with other team members are connecting with hospitals and managing food delivery.What if my kids just want to walk The Herbfarm's pigs, Basil and Borage?Check out The Herbfarm's Patreon page, the $100 monthly contribution level allows just that!Chef Chris Weber of The Herbfarm talking about pivoting the restaurant's operations to serve hundreds of boxed meals each day to doctors and nurses on the front lines of COVID19###################

He was airlifted to the nearest large hospital for emergency brain surgery. He spent the next 5 days on a ventilator and 10 days total in ICU. We are happy to share that he is now recovering on the Neurosurgical floor, waiting to be medically ready to relocate to an intensive inpatient rehab facility in the Seattle area. We are all hoping and praying for as much recovery as possible. At this time, Alex is still unable to move or feel the entire left side of his body. He will be in rehab for at least 30 days, followed by months of therapies to help him learn a new way of life and achieve a new set of goals.Due to CoViD-19 risks, Alex has not been allowed ANY visitors throughout this ordeal.Alex has always been very active outdoors: riding mountain bikes since he could walk, cutting firewood with his dad in Montana, instilling a love of nature in his children with lots of family camping trips and hikes. Alex has been an avid mountaineer, backcountry skier, and volunteer mountaineering instructor, sharing his passion for the natural world. Now, at age 45, Alex will face the largest and most difficult climb of his life thus far.As a self-employed small business owner, and effectively a one-man army, Alex has operated a small general contracting business, serving his small community north of Seattle since 1999. This accounted for approximately 70 percent of the family’s household income. Due to the severity of his stroke, and complications during his time in ICU, Alex’s medical team expects he will be unable to return to this type of work for at least a year, if at all.So many of Alex’s friends and family have asked how they can be of help during this time, which led me to creating this GoFundMe page. During a time when we cannot be there physically, we can support in other ways. We hope to ease the financial challenges of this life-altering nightmare for Alex, his wife Heather, and their three children, Keegan, Miranda, and Mallory. They already feel blessed by the immediate offerings of support by friends, family and the community Alex has worked in for years.



Thank you to everyone, we will keep you updated on Alex’s progress.

The Kemps were notified that Kyle will be transferred to an inpatient rehab facility in Jacksonville, FL to build Kyle's strength on January 22nd, which is great news. Though still paralyzed from the chest down, his markers for the cancer has reduced, again great news. Kyle is heading in the right direction and very excited. He just recently toldme last night he is nervous and looking forward to Monday. He stated, ""This is like going to boot camp, I am going to work hard and stay focused, so I can come home to my wife in our house and not be put back in the hospital."" With these great milestones made, also came some bad news on Tuesday. They went to order Kyle's chemo medicine just as they have for the last few months and was told the cost would be $4400 which is part of their deductible. They asked if they could make payments, and was advised no must be paid in full. As of right now Kyle has not been able to take chemo for 2 days, the same chemo that has reduced his markers. In addition to that Kyle will need home equipment such as a specialized wheel chair, hospital bed and much more which won’t be determined until after rehab. The insurance will only pay $5000 for the DME benefit everything else will be out of pocket. He will also need 24/7 care when he returns home.  I know there has been so many people that have helped in many ways, which the Kemps are very appreciated of. Help is not always about giving financially, but maybe someone knows someone who can help with getting equipment or knows programs that help in getting things like this. If you can donate to help that is great as well. Sometimes it just about sharing the story to see who is out there who may have gone through this with advice on how to cope with this situation. Kyle is also a Veteran from the US Coast Guard so maybe there is programs we aren’t aware of that can help. Thanks in advance for your Support #TeamKemp Sandie MillerRead more"

Hi, my name is Tara Nicholas.

The reason I started this fundraiser was to try and raise money to help my sister Dakota with the medical costs related to her diagnosis of              Guillain-barre.

Guillain-barre Syndrome is a rare disorder in which your body’s immune system attacks     your nerves. Weakness and tingling in your extremities are usually the first symptoms.      These sensations can quickly spread, eventually paralyzing your whole body.My sister is probably one of the sweetest people you will come across. She hasn’t had the best of luck when it comes to her health the past couple years. Dakota was diagnosed with bladder cancer 5 years ago. She has been cancer free since and             continues to get checked every year.Last February Dakota lost her job of 5yrswhen the pandemic hit. Meaning she also lost her health insurance. She ended up having to move back home to Indiana.This past January Dakota started feeling some pain in her feet when she would be walking.That pain lasted for about a month and a half before she was able to get into a doctor.By this time she started feeling numbness in her legs, arms, and hands.Her doctor diagnosed her with neuropathyand sent her to get blood work. She was told to go to the ER is she started feeling worse. Her symptoms got worse and her body started to feel numb.Within a couple days she went from being able to walk to needing help to get out of bed so she headed to the ER.

Dakota was admitted to the hospital on       February 25,2021.She’s had 5 MRIs, CT scan, lumbar puncture, and a EMG. She is receiving transfusions daily. Dakota has already lost all function of her feet and 75% of function of her hands.She’s tough and I know she has a long road ahead of her for when she is released from the hospital she will be going into a rehab facility to help her gain her muscle strength back.They say recovery can be anywhere from 6-12 months. We’re not sure how long she will be receiving treatment before starting physicaltherapy in the rehab facility.Thanks everyone for taking the time to read   this! I know not everyone will be able to       donate. All I ask is for everyone to say a prayerand to please share this!

The limb was so large and heavy that Ryan suffered severe head and neck trauma. He stopped breathing and had to be revived by his mom as his family waited for paramedics. Ryan was transported to one hospital, only to be told they could not handle the extent of his injuries and he would need to be moved to Johns Hopkins Hospital. Once at Johns Hopkins, Ryan's family learned that he had massive brain bleeding, extensive swelling of the brain and a broken neck. Initially doctors thought the brain swelling would remain undercontrol. However, within hours Ryan had to be rushed into surgery. He underwent a 3 hour brain surgery to stop the bleeding and in order to have a portion of his skull removed to relieve the pressure from his swelling brain. Ryan has been placed into a medically-induced paralysis in order to protect his neck and spinal cord while the doctors work to keep him stable from his brain injury. Within the next day or so he will be placed into a medically induced coma for possibly 5 days to give his brain a chance to heal. Right now it is a waiting game to see when he will be brought out of the coma, and to see if he will regain consciousness. Only then can doctors begin to determine the extent of his brain damage and whether or not he will be paralyzed from the neck injury.Ryan's family is in dire need of funds to pay for this long and heart-wrenching journey. Family and friends are all praying he will wake up and that he will not be paralyzed. But even then, he will require months of inpatient rehabiliation and the medical bills will continue to mount for this family. Ryan's mom will not be able to continue working while Ryan is recovering and in rehab. Their lives are forever altered.Some of you may know Ryan and his family personally, some of you may not. Let me assure you that this is a family you will want to help. They are kind, generous and giving in every thing they do. Ryan is the most upbeat, positive person I have ever met. He is wise and compassionate beyond his years, and he would do anything to help someone in need.Ryan's family has one job.....to be there for Ryan and see him to recovery. They should not have to worry and stress over how they will pay for the medical expenses and contiue to pay their bills.  All funds will go directly to Judy Lapinski, Ryan's mom.Thank you for taking the time to ready Ryan's story. Please help in any way you can. No amount is too small. Your prayers and well wishes for a fast and full receovery are welcome as well.Sincerely,RobynRead more"

I suffered an incomplete cervical spinal cord injury (resulting in becoming quadriplegic), severe lacerations, broken bones, and a head injury. After multiple surgeries and rehab we were blessed with having our sweet baby girl. There have been improvements since the accident, and I truly feel that this is the next step. We have found a company in the US that offers self derived mesenchymal stem cells from your abdominal adipose tissue.

On April 12th, 2020, (Easter Sunday), Zachary “Zack” Fehrenbach was involved in a very serious motorcycle accident. Zack spent 12 days in the ICU at Elliot Hospital while in a coma and on a ventilator. He has suffered a traumatic brain injury that has required multiple very high risk medical procedures to save his life. Zack wasn’t expected to survive the first 3 days in the ICU due to his injuries but has overcome the odds and has been making progress. His ventilator was removed after day 7, but he developed bi-lateral pneumonia and was combating high temperatures along with high blood pressure for several days. Despite all of these added complications, Zack has managed to hang on and become stable enough to be moved to a medical floor with in Elliot Hospital. His prognosis is uncertain at the moment. The extent of brain injury is unknown. The Fehrenbach Family has been informed that Zack has a long road ahead of him and to what extent he will heal is not predictable. His Parents Ed and Velvet have been with him around the clock and are doing everything in their power to bring him back to to us. A key factor in Zack recovery is receiving long term rehab at a facility that specializes in traumatic brain injuries. Unfortunately, Zack doesn’t have insurance. His parent have been actively seeking assistance for Zack through government aids and funds during this tragedy. Zack’s Parents have both been out of work tending to their child’s needs during this time. Their sole focus is to help their child heal and recover. The financial impact has been devastating. With every day that goes by the bigger the financial strain will grow. Let’s all gather support and love for the Fehrenbach Family and our loved Zack. Any financial contribution is greatly appreciated.Read more"

From Sara 4/21: Day 26: Hi everyone we just wanted to give you the daily update earlier this evening. Last night and into today was the first full day Paul/Tucker is off of oxygen and on room air! Every breath is still fought for and the best news about this means it’s a first step of coming home! Speaking of steps, therapy has proven itself and he’s walking again, though in his own words “it’s more of a wobble than a walk- kind of like how I dance”. Importantly he gained 10lbs of nearly 40 lost and this is also a milestone of return. His doctors are thinking of sending him home late this week and though it’s a moving target, it’s something to motivate him. We love you all and are continued to be stunned by the support from everyone! We will get through this and it is not without your support. Cheers!
Hi everyone! Potential discharge tomorrow! Tentative SURPRISE if you want to gather outside of Saratoga Hospital socially distanced.
Day 24: Well everyone I wanted to try to give my own update today, 7 days after the ventilator was removed.  I’ve had some bad days and some good but every inch I’ve fought for is hallowed and I won’t give it up. Sara read to me so many messages of support and love when I was unable to read but I could always understand.  I am stunned by the support of everyone; friends colleagues and even strangers have been touched not by my story but for the message of hope and the humanity shown by all. I owe it to you all for what has been done and it’s my promise to you that I will continue to fight the fight. I will walk out of this hospital.  I will continue to serve the community that has supported me so selflessly. I thank you and love you all for the endless support and together, we will triumph over COVID and once again walk shoulder to shoulder!
4/17 Day 22 Rather than ending on a negative note I will share a note with you all. Some people who are on a ventilator for 11 days are just starting to talk after a few days. As you all know how Paul/""Tucker"" talks he started speaking right away and was even upset that speech therapy was sent to help him. He said, ""Speech therapy? Talking is the only thing I am good at."" Cheers and have a great weekend! #Tuckertribe #Tuckertalk
From Sara 4/15: Paul/Tucker is off of the ventilator and graduated from the ICU, no longer in critical condition! He is recovering and thanks you all for the outpouring of support, love and prayers. He has a road of recovery ahead of him and we will continue to keep everyone updated on the status reports. As always, many thanks, sending love around the world! Cheers #Tuckertribe!

I thought she was being silly but instead, she said she couldn't feel her legs.It was that evening that she ended up in the hospital for emergency surgery to save her from becoming paralyzed. Dr. David Feldman was our angel that day. He performed emergency surgery on his day off and because of him, Maria was able to walk, dance, and live again.Fast forward fifteen years, October 2016, from a simple fall in the bathroom, Maria injured her knee. She was born with a genetic disorder that consists of insensitivity to pain with anhydrosis. Meaning, she does not have the full capability of feeling pain as we do. Since October 2016, she was still able to work and walk on her knee until it was completely shattered until she needed to have surgery. Only this time, Dr. David Feldman has moved to Florida and cannot perform surgery on Maria. You would think there are so many other doctors in NY, why go to Florida? Because of insurance, she was not able to go to Florida and have the surgery and had to look for a doctor here in NY. After a handful of NY doctors refused this surgery because ""it is too complicated,"" she was able to find a doctor that wanted to help Maria and perform the surgery. He was nice enough to have Dr. Feldman fly in and assist him in the operating room. These expenses were paid out of pocket by my parents. It only took 3 months of waiting on bed rest to get this situation under control. On April 3rd 2017, Maria finally had the surgery and was hospitalized for another 3 months including rehab to get the physical therapy and care she needed to get her back on her feet. Unfortunately, even after the surgery, rest, and physical therapy, the results were not what we hoped for. She will now need another operation to save her leg. However, she needs to have the operation in Florida with Dr. Feldman and his team. And because her insurance does not have out of state coverage, she will have to pay out of pocket for not only the surgery, but the hospital stay and recovery.  As we all know health care is very costly. The price is unreal, and for this reason we are asking for your gracious support.Doctor Feldman's expertise will make the osteotomy a success. Maria just wants to live a normal life. Her road to recovery is long. Her will to walk and run is strong.It breaks my heart to see my sister go through this and all I want is for her to get her life back together. To get back on her feet and be the bold, lively, young woman that she was. Time is not on our side. It's been almost a year since she fell and shattered her knee and will probably need at least another 3 months of physical therapy after the surgery. The sooner she comes up with the funds, the sooner she will be able to have the operation to save her leg and get her back up again.Thank you for your time and support.""I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers."" -Ephesians 1:16Read more"

Two CT scans and a MRI later, we learned that his 6th Cervical Vertebra (C6) was crushed and was touching the spine. He was immediately taken into surgery where they removed the broken piece of bone and infused it with a metal plate. The strong impact on the spine has resulted in him losing all movements in his body waist down. He can lift his hands but not use his wrist or fingers.His lungs were highly inflamed because of the water he consumed while drowning. After three days, he was taken off the ventilator. He is now trying to breathe on his own. We are thankful to God and the doctors at Grady for giving him back to us.Dhrupad is a young kid who had an American dream to come here, be a pilot and become a contributing member of the society. Dhrupad always talks about establishing a non-profit organization to help children in need. He is now struggling each day to wrap his head around the fact that he may never be able to walk or write again. We need your prayers and support to tell him that we are all with him and he must believe in himself to finish what he started 8 years ago.His path to recovery includes extensive rehab for atleast 3 months. We are trying to get him into a Rehab Center which will cost him out of pocket an estimate of $ 150,000.This fundraiser is to help meet exceedingly high medical costs which would be incurred during his rehab.Read more"

You are reading this right now because of love and inspiration all having to do with one very special woman, Ashlee Terwilliger. This past week Ashlee underwent a double lung transplant because she has Cystic Fibrosis. Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that attacks the lungs, filling them with mucus which causes infections and, overtime, damages the lung tissues making it nearly impossible to breathe on your own. Ashlee has spent her entire adult life taking 5 breathes for our every 1 and now she has new lungs. This is fantastic! The reason you are reading this is because as great as this is, there is a road to recovery she and her family must travel. Ashlee must live within 5 minutes from the University of Pennsylvania Hospital for a year while undergoing rehab. This is 2 hours away from her home so she and her family are going to have to rent a place to stay.When you add that up with medical billsand travel, it gives us a great opportunity to lessen the cost. While you can’t put a price on health, I’m asking that we come together and raise money for Ashlee so she and her family can strictly focus on her rehab and not have to worry for a second about any kind of financial burden. If you know Ashlee and her husband Jimmy, you know they don’t want it. Donate anyway! Please get this message to as many people as you can. Give what you can. Ashlee’s road to enjoying fresh air starts now and we can help. Thank you for your support and contribution for this very special lady. Read more"

Whether you've gotten to tour with him, or just talked to him for a second, you already know how kind, compassionate, talented, and hilarious he is. He's the sort of guy who would give you the shirt off his back if you needed it, and Sunny is equally as amazing. Let's help them out in their time of need. All funds will be deposited directly to Sunny's bank account whether or not we reach our goal.Here is a message from Sunny:The love of my life, Chucky Hope, was working a show in rural Australia when a PA fell on his head. A few hours after this, he ate the only vegan catering option available, and a few hours later spent 8-10 hours vomiting from what was suspected food poisoning. He made his way home to me in Byron Bay a day later. He was weak and I suspected dehydration from the food poisoning.Over the next two days, he slept and only had the strength to make it to our bathroom and back to bed running a fever. On Tuesday January 29th, he messaged me at work that ""something is really wrong"". We got him into our local doctor immediately, and that was the last time that he walked.From there he was rushed to the local hospital where tests were run, and then to a larger hospital. Overnight, the paralysis spread to his entire body and he was transferred to the ICU. After a lumbar puncture, they suspected Gillian Barre and treatment began.Two days later, the treatment wasn't working and his left lung collapsed. He was intubated and put on a central line. He was like this for 10 days with little memory of his time spent in there. The diagnosis then changed, and a full team of doctors remained puzzled. Developing pneumonia from the intubation, he fought infection and fever like hell. When he was awake, he kept communicating by blinking and little finger taps in the two fingers he could move. That sense of humour I love so much still very much alive in a trapped body.He began to improve, so was moved to a ward and taken off the intubation while sore, exhausted and confused.He now has some movement in his upper body, and we are trying desperately to get him into a rehab facility before too much muscle mass is lost in his legs. He just wants to walk.... he just wants to go home.The road to recovery is going to be a long, hard and mentally challenging one, but he is up for the fight. He is currently unable to work though. Days exhaust him, and the support needed is extensive and expensive so any little bit helps. If you can't help with money, just help with sending him love and positive vibes please.Thank you.Read more"

A vessel bursted which caused bleeding in the brain which led to the stroke. He was rushed to the hospital. As of right now, he is currently in Baltimore, Maryland. He was away for a softball tournament with his team. He had collapsed in the middle of the game. His wife, Carla, and his mother, Josephine, flew out as soon as they found out. If you know Shawn, you know he loves to play softball and hockey. When he wasn’t working, he would be out and about at practice and tournaments or spending time with his wife and daughter, Casey. He was a huge part in Casey’s love for softball which they bonded over. He often helped out with her softball team as he was her biggest fan. This stroke has forever changed his life. He will not be able to play again or work again. And maybe not even be able to walk again at this point.It’s important that he gets transferred back to this area not only for his family but to Mass General Hospital in Boston because they specialize in neurology. He may need surgery. He cannot feel anything on the left side of this body, which means he will need extensive rehab to hopefully get some movement back on that side.Please keep praying for Shawn and keep him in your thoughts. If you would like to donate, it would be much appreciated! The money would be going towards transporting him to MGH in Boston. I know money can be tight, so if you cannot donate, help us by just continuing to pray! He has a long road of recovery ahead of him! Please share and keep the positive thoughts coming this way.

She was diagnosed with Covid on December 14th, and then placed on a ventilator January 3, 2021. Drue was life-flighted from Cullman Regional Medical Center to North Alabama Medical Center in Florence, Alabama. We believe that God opened that door for her, after we had called hospitals in seven states and they were all on diversion. Later, God magically revealed a chance for a higher level of care, and it included specialists, neurology and pulmonology. We didn't even consider the financial burden that the McSwain family would ensue. Our goal was to improve Drue's chances of surviving here on Earth. When Drue arrived at Florence, her condition was dire and critical. The doctors wanted to be optimistic because of her age, but we were told her chances of surviving were minimal. Her lungs were ravaged by this horrible virus. After approximately 5 weeks on the ventilator, multiple positive Covid tests, a tracheostomy and coding for almost 15 minutes, Drue was slowly weaned off the ventilator. Our family was finally able to visit after she tested negative for Covid. Drue began communicating via eye movements and a week later she was texting and Facebooking. On the day she was sent to rehab, Drue finally reunited with her sons Candler and Cullen. There have been a few minor setbacks since Drue was dismissed from the hospital the first time, but she continues to persevere. It has been 81 days and counting since Drue has been at home with her family and when she finally makes it back there will likely be many months of continued rehab. Drue is a pure miracle! God has supernaturally healed her in a mighty way. Her healing is from God, and God alone, and we give Him all the Glory. We stand in AWE of what He has done. Drue is determined and she will overcome all the medical, physical, emotional and financial challenges that have been laid before her. However, we feel lead to attempt to lessen her earthly burdens and challenges. The McSwain family has accrued a large medical bill and we would first ask that you pray for Drue, Jay, Candler and Cullen; but secondly support her in any way you feel lead. Let us join forces, unite and love on this family in a mighty way!Read more"

Arthur Coon is the ultimate soldier and veteran. He served 32 years between the US Army and NY Army National Guard, enlisting over 250 soldiers during his 13 years as a recruiter. He’s incredibly proud to have jumped out of airplanes in the 82nd airborne and is constantly showing everyone videos of blackhawks, c-130s, and any other military planes he can find. He knows the sound of a Blackhawk and runs for a video every time he hears one.He started the SFC Coon’s Christmas Eve Road March in 2004 as a way to show soldiers who couldn’t be home for Christmas that we’re thinking of them and aren’t forgetting about their bravery for our freedom. He continued his service after retirement and grew the Road March to over 1800 people in 2019, as well as continued to serve in any capacity that he could. He answered calls for prospective soldiers, helped with photography where he could, and maintained a small hill at the Queensbury Armory with trees and plaques honoring soldiers who served through the Glens Falls and Queensbury armories who are no longer with us.

Our dad, Arthur Coon, had a massive stroke on May 11, 2020 at age 58. He was the picture of health. He exercised for up to three hours a day, watched his diet meticulously (other than his one daily diet Mountain Dew!) and told our family constantly that he would outlive all of us to well into his hundreds. This is a huge blow to our family. He is larger than life, this unshatterable presence in our family and to this community that we never expected to see in such a serious condition. Julie Coon, our mother and his wife of almost 36 years, saved his life. She found him in just barely enough time to get him to the Glens Falls Hospital and was told with Amanda that his condition was “grave”. Unexpectedly, the doctor came in and let her know they’d sent his records to Albany Medical Center and if they flew him via helicopter within an hour they could try surgery.He may have retired, but along with his wife Julie, he is not in retirement. They’re still giving everything they can to give back to soldiers, families, and the community. If you need a patch sewn on your uniform, you call them. If you need help with deployed soldier care packages, you call them. They’re selfless and give everything for their love of their country, their soldiers, and anyone they meet. They’ve been beacons of hope for so many families during deployments, basic training, and even privately for families who need them.His pilot happened to be flying his first patient and was also a beloved enlistment of our dad. That fact immediately felt like fate to our family. He had the surgery, and by some absolute miracle he was off the ventilator and talking by the next day. He’s making progress but it’s an incredibly long, expensive road ahead. There are also still a lot of unknowns, including more surgery on his brain. We are anticipating some home modifications that would help in the short term, but potentially long term. Healthcare costs are already mounting and rehab is not expected to be fully covered.Our parents are unbelievably generous. They are givers and wouldn’t ask for anything from anyone, but we know what they’re facing. Between the two of us we can help some things, but we’re afraid of what the future holds. Our mother is already exploring the option of selling their home of 29 years and we want to do everything we can to prevent that. These two are so loved and respected for everything they’ve done and we feel that we have to do whatever we can to ease this burden on them. We truly appreciate any donation, it will help our parents immensely and take a lot of pressure and fear off the table. We want them both to be able to heal and move forward without worrying every step of the way about what impact the costs will have on them. In the words of SFC Arthur Coon, HOOAH!

The pain persisted for a few days and continued to get worse; at this point, it was time to seek medical attention. Yadan and his family soon found out he had a blood clot. The pain continued and the clot did not go away. There was no warning or no preexisting conditions. Life can change abruptly!Following this diagnosis there was a month and a half of doctor visits, urgent care visits, misdiagnosis, and ultrasounds to figure out why his discolored swollen ankle would not subside. It was not until his final ultrasound in December that Yadan was rushed to the ICU. On December 1, 2020, Yadan was hospitalized and the blood clots were now in the arteries of his left thigh. He checked into Emory St. Joseph’s Hospital at around 9:30 and was immediately hauled off to surgery. In efforts to get rid of the clots and alleviate swelling, the vascular doctor cut two incisions on the back of his left calf. Al-Hamduillah (praise God), blood began to flow; however, it was too late to save his left foot. At that time, his doctor advised him that he would have to amputate right below his knee because the infection in his ankle was getting worse and spreading. Unfortunately, there was no way to undo the damage. Because this was a life-altering decision, Yadan went home to his wife and children and began to brainstorm the ways he could attempt to save his foot. After various alternatives were investigated, the damage to his foot progressed. On Monday, February 15, 2021, Yadan again checked himself into Emory St. Joseph’s to proceed with the amputation.Changes to theBrucefamily’s livelihood and home are inevitable.This GoFundMe has been created to help offset the cost of home expenses, home modifications, and medical equipment. Yadan has been out of work for several months and has several months of rehab ahead of him. In addition to the drastic change, the family insurance will not cover a prosthetic for Yadan. After conducting research, the price of the prosthetic ranges from $10,000 - $50,000.We are humbly asking for donations for this family to make this transition a little easier.

Unfortunately his MShas changed from Relapsing remitting to a progressive MS. Cody is an amazing and determined individual that has a huge heart. Cody is the best husband and father to an amazing woman Morgan Yates and young girl Kya Yates. He has been hospitalized since October 2019 between multiple hospital and rehab. Cody was a candidate for the plasmaphorisis treatment that unfortunately did not help. At this time he is back in Saskatoon to decide on the next steps. Morgan continues to work as the best nurse I know throughout the hospitalization of Cody to help support her family. Even though they have an amazing family and friend support throughout this, there is still the financial aspect that would greatly help though this tough time to help with travel, accommodations, and everyday living expenses. Any donations would be a great to help out this amazing family!From Morgan:Well Cody did his stay in Clover House, where sadly he did not get better.. he slowly developed new symptoms. His hearing became next to nothing, his swallowing and speech became effected and he lost mobility more and more in his left arm and than also in his right arm. We got a hearing appt where he found out sadly hearing aids would not help his hearing improve and Cody needed to find out if a lesion was affecting the hearing nerve. With all this going on Cody moved from Clover House into The Meadows as well, we stayed in contact with the MS doctor in Saskatoon, and hearing about these new symptoms he wanted a transfer up there but agreed with family that Cody should stay in Swift for Christmas. December 27th Cody was transferred back to Saskatoon, and his dad was able to go with Cody. Cody went for another MRI yesterday and we found out Cody has multiple new lesions on his brain, brain stem and spinal cord, along with old lesions have gotten bigger. Meaning his MS has changed from Relapsing remitting to a progressive MS. Cody is still in Saskatoon because I believe there is still some more tests to be completed. From what I have been told Cody is in the best spirits I feel/think you can be, as there is no medication in Canada that can help him at this time. Thank you everyone from the bottom of all our hearts for your well wishes, prayers and thoughts. They are greatly appreciated, I will try to keep everyone updated as I know alot of you have been wondering how Cody is doing.I also want to thank all of our family for everything they have done, and continue to do for Cody, myself and Kya, we greatly appreciate it!**Cody Update from Morgan**Cody's neurologist and MS doctor are baffled at how much his MS has progressed in such a short time, they said for it to produce so many new lesions and make old ones grow is something extremely rare. However, with that being said we are trialing a chemo medication called, Cyclophosphamide. There is side uses for autoimmune diseases with it, it will not stop Cody's MS but it will slow the progression and temporarily halt it. They can not promise he will regain things back that he has lost, but in some cases certain patients have regained some things back, so our fingers are crossed and we are hopeful he regains some functions back.Cody has been able to take a blended/puree diet and tolerating that I have been told and tolerating juice as well. He has regained a little bit of strength back and his spirits are slightly better. The treatment he is receiving is a four day treatment, today is Day 3 of 4 and than the doctor's would like to keep him up in Saskatoon for another 7 days, I'm not too sure why but my guess would be to maybe do another MRI to see if this medication has done anything. Thankfully Cody's Da, Mike, is able to stay up there with him so Cody will not be alone during this time.I will end this saying I'm not to sure what 2020 has in store but whatever it is we will get through it with all the love, support and help from family, friends, loved ones and people who just genuinely care.

Help my sister, Gina, after a surgery mishapI am not one to ask for much. However, at this time, I am reaching out to my family and friends to help me raise money for my sister, Gina. On September 5th, after a year of back pain, she met with a neurosurgeon. At that time the surgeon recommended spine surgery. It was to be an outpatient procedure that was minimally invasive. She was told she would be back to work after 3 to 5 days. Surgery was scheduled for September 27. Unfortunately, on September 16, Gina was rear ended in an accident. She was taken to the hospital and had a 6 day hospital stay. She was released on Sunday and spine surgery was scheduled for that following Friday. The surgery was performed. The next day Gina ended up back in the E.R. in excruciating pain. She was admitted for pain management and observation. The doctors were unable to figure out the source of the pain. She was basically bedridden. They discharged her after 14 days. Home health care was set up, along with pain management.Today is day 68 post op, she is mostly still bedridden and still experiencing excruciating pain and muscle spasms. Gina is still not able to sit for any extended period of time. She is working on walking now. She is unable to walk without the aid of a walker. This week she starts physical therapy. Her Physical Medicine Rehab doctor, along with her physical therapist, say it’s going to be a long and grueling process. She is still in the process of trying to figure out the source of the pain and the diagnosis.The reason I have set up this fund is that Gina is self-employed. If she doesn’t work, she doesn’t get paid. She has done her best to stay above water and being her optimistic self, had hoped to return to work before her savings were depleted. But, that is not the case. She is a hard worker, and truly enjoys what she does.Gina finds it very difficult to ask for help, as it is embarrassing. But the reality is, she needs help. So I have decided to take the initiative to reach out to our family and all of our friends. If you would please consider donating any amount, we could help her and her son at this difficult time. I assure you that once Gina is back on her feet and back to her sparkly self, she will be paying it forward as well.Thank you for taking the time to read her story and for your consideration to donate. Together, we can help to keep her head above water, her spirits bright, hopeful and optimistic, during this long healing period. 

I am also hoping it will help to alleviate the financial pressure she is enduring due to ZERO income, incoming medical bills, and her monthly expenses. Let’s give her the opportunity and the ability just to focus on her healing.With much gratitude,Jane BrittonSent from my iPad

On Sunday, our dear friend freelance photojournalist Wil Riera was admitted into a hospital while working in Venezuela. He has undergone two emergency brain surgeries to correct a congenital disorder which has caused him to a have a brain hemorrhage. He is currently in a medically induced coma and the prognosis is uncertain. The funds collected through Go Fund Me will be sent to a personal family friend of his who is overseeing his finances while he is hospitalized with the consent of his family.

The funds will be used to help alleviate the costs of any medical care not immediately covered by insurance. In addition, the money willbe kept for future rehab, treatments, and daily life expenses as he rehabilitates. Since, he is a freelancer he is not receiving any income during his stay and his future is unclear.

Wil is the sole caretaker for his family. We will be sharing some of the money with his parents to cover their basic needs.

I have been Wil Riera's assignment photo editor at Bloomberg News in New York for over two years and have worked closely with him on a daily basis. Wil is an exceptional photographer and person.

Please give what you can -any amount is appreciated. Help us spread the word.

In January he underwent brain surgery to remove as much of the tumor that could be. He remained in the hospital for 8 weeks, where he suffered many setbacks. He was finally released and went to a rehab center where he worked so hard to get his strength and other simple skills back. He was doing very well. Then he started his chemotherapy and radiation. It sent him backwards- just about every skill he had redeveloped relapsed. At the same time, his insurance stopped paying for his upkeep at the rehab center, so he was sent home, which meant he needed round the clock care. It is extremely costly; his family is struggling to make this work. Any help that any of you can give will be greatly appreciated.I will update his progress on a weekly basisThank you"

Prior to her accident, Nicole lived a very active lifestyle, including an extremely successful varsity soccer career with both the University of Alberta and MacEwan University. Forever the outdoorsy woman, she loves hiking, camping, and adventuring wherever she goes.Nicole, otherwise known as Pal, is a strong, positive, and kind force that inspires everyone around her with her optimistic outlook on life.

As some of you may be aware Shaun had a serious accident while playing AFL on the 19th of September.

He was paralysed from the neck down. They airvaced him from the footy field direct to Royal North Shore Hospital. He was in a stable condition in ICU, and now has been moved to the rehab ward.He fractured his C- spine (C3-C5 vertebrae ) resulting in an Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury. The injury is complicated because of thebleeding, swelling and inflammation in and around the spinal cord.Until the swelling goes down and Shaun completes rehab it’s uncertain if he’s currentdeficits are temporary or permanent.

Shaun is genuine, strong and just an all round good bloke.Anyone that’s had the pleasure of being in Shaun’s presence knows this!However, the next few months are going to be tough for him and his family.

This gofundme will help with the financial stress while he navigates the uncertainty of the future. All donations will be going directly to Shaun.

Thank you for your generosity!

Her husband is a full-time mechanic and she is a Dental Hygienist.On Monday May 18, 2020, Russ drove Jenna to the ER in Ann Arbor because something was seriously wrong. For a about a week prior to heading to the ER, Jenna started experiencing a variety of symptoms that progressed each day. It started with numbness and tingling in both her feet and hands which progressed up her legs and arms. We thought she possibly had a pinched nerve or slept funny. Then one morning, Jenna was barely able to get out of bed, walk, and she could no longer lift up her youngest boy. She became unable to ambulate, sit or stand, or even go to the bathroom without assistance. Prior to this, Jenna was a healthy 31-year-old. As these symptoms progressed and we knew something was not right, I drove to her house to help take care of the kids which gave her and Russ the opportunity to go to the hospital to get some answers.After going through many tests from neurologists, a couple MRIs, blood tests, a lumbar puncture, and a sleepless night in the emergency room, the next day it was confirmed that Jenna was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). This is a very rare autoimmune disorder that is not inherited nor contagious. It can happen to anyone and her neurologists said they diagnose between 20-30 patients with this each year at their hospital. The doctors believe Jenna developed this due to a bacterial or viral infection where her own body mistakenly started attacking her own peripheral nervous system which involves the nerves around your brain and spinal cord. Symptoms can range from weakness to paralysis that starts peripherally and works its way centrally and can even lead to respiratory failure from paralysis of your respiratory muscles.Immediately after receiving the diagnosis, Jenna received 2 intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusions. The goal of IVIG therapy is to transfuse healthy antibodies from donors into your blood since your own immune system has produced antibodies that are harmful and are attacking your own nerves. The neurologists said it can take up to 48-72 hours to see any benefit from the infusions. After receiving these infusions, they scheduled for Jenna to begin intense inpatient rehab as soon as possible.Currently, Jenna is getting rehab 3 times a day. When we have FaceTimed, she is easily short of breath and winded when talking. She has said that respiratory therapists have been monitoring her and have been doing exercises with her breathing. She has a wheelchair, still needs 2-3 people assisting her to a bedside commode, is having a hard time reaching us on her phone because of the struggle she has had with her dexterity, and they have had to wrap utensils to make them thicker and easier to grasp while eating. Walking has been a challenge as she is still having a hard time feeling her feet and having strength. Her PT/OT team has said she will need to continue this intense inpatient rehab for at least 3-4 weeks now.We have been hoping and praying for God to heal her quickly and make her stronger each day. It has been very tough on the family since nobody is allowed to visit her and help. Each day has been a tough mental struggle with Jenna because all of this happened so fast and going through it alone in the hospital was never something anyone expected. Although we have not seen improvement as quickly as we all have hope and prayed for, we are still praying vigilantly and know that she will pull through this and will heal and become stronger with each day.This has been very tough for Jenna and Russ and it will be a long road to recovery. We still don’t know if Jenna will have any permanent damage to her nerves or if she will recover fully. I ask during this time for your support in any way possible. We wholeheartedly believe in the healing power of prayer and encourage those of you that also believe this to please lift up Jenna, Russ, and the boys in yours as well in hopes that she can be 100% recovered and back home with her husband running around with her boys before we know it.All money raised will go directly towards covering medical bills not covered by insurance. On behalf of Jenna & Russ, we are forever grateful for any help you can give towards helping them. Thank you from the bottom of my heart,Sandi (Jenna’s mom)Read more"

The next few days will be critical. Please keep him, his family, friends and the donor in your thoughts.*UPDATE ON TUCKER*Tucker is currently at Duke Medical Center getting a double lung transplant. We made it but there is still lots of raising and support to go! Thank you for everyone's continues support and love!!Tucker Gordon has been dealing with cystic fibrosis is whole life. Its a hereditary chronic disease that effects your pancreas, lungs and other vital organs. After 25 years of treatments, medicine, and many days and nights spent in the hospital, his lungs are close to giving up and Tuckers only hope is to receive a double lung transplant. Receiving a double lung transplant is more of a process than you would think-you don't receive the lungs and then go home. Once you are accepted by a hospital like DUKE your family has to promise to be fully committed mentally, physically, and financially. Although the mental part will come natural, the other two are a struggle. You have to promise that all all times(24 hours a day seven days a week) there will be someone there for the patient that will be willing to take care and watch over him. This is a process that takes minimum of three months after the transplant. This person will have to drive the patient to and from their rehab help with medicine and iv's, and be able to live in the duke area out of a hotel for that whole time. This is a huge financial problem when most hotels withe the medical discount in that area is about on avg 90$ a night. They don't want to transplant patients who wont be able to receive the proper care after and be able to heal right so they make sure that you have the proper funding. If everything was to go perfect and Tucker was released to go home after three months that is still over 8000 just in living. Not including gas, food, medicine etc. We were lucky enough to have insight on this early and raise money for Chantel and with help of family and friends get the money together. Not everyone is as fortunate and you can imagine being a single mom and having to pay her rent, tuckers rent, and now rent in DUKE this is close to impossible without help. Please think about Tucker and without these lungs he cant get better. Chantel finally had the chance to see what it was like to breathe and she told me it was the best feeling in the world. Lets give Tucker that chance and the chance to keep living a better life. Anything will help. Thank you for taking the time to look at this page.Marye-AnnRead more"

Suddenly, in June 2016, at the age of just 3 ½, Laney started having strokes due to an extremely rare and aggressive vascular disease affecting the brain. In the time since her initial strokes, Laney’s family and friends have watched her lose all of her abilities — walking, talking, eating, playing, smiling, laughing, seeing, and moving. Laney spent three months in the hospital, and then for the next five months, she worked so hard in daily intensive rehab. Unfortunately, Laney recently suffered additional acute strokes, which have removed any possibility of recovery — making her condition terminal. Her loving parents are heartbroken. Laney also has a baby sister who was born two months after her strokes started. Laney was so very excited to be a big sister, but sadly, never had the opportunity to connect or play with her. Laney’s medical and therapy copays, equipment expenses and other related expenses have piled up, and additionally, the family may need to hire a medical professional to help take care of Laney at home while she is on hospice care. I know many of us have asked repeatedly if there is any way wecan help, and so many have already helped — through constant love, support, food, and offers of assistance. I’ve seen firsthand how much her parents, Laura and Brian, appreciate this outpouring of love and support from their friends and family. Donating to this campaign is another way folks can help a wonderful family during a very difficult time in their lives. With much love and appreciation,Aubrey CollinsRead more"

He is a student at GCU and despite being careful, he still contracted Covid-19. He was admitted to Banner Medical Center in Phoenix, AZ 2 days later with a high fever, bad cough, and double pneumonia in both lungs with infiltrates. They put him on the medication regimen for covid, steroids, and oxygen but he wasn't improving.  On Christmas Day, he had to be transferred to ICU and intubated on a ventilator because his lungs were shutting down and he was not getting enough oxygen. Things would only get WORSE. In the next coming weeks, the coronavirus took over his body and he had to be put on maximum Lung Support, Heart Support, and Kidney Support. He had inflammation throughout his body and the heart and kidneys started to fail. I remember doctors telling us that Austin was one of the sickest covid patients on the ward.  As a last resort, the cardiac surgeon put Austin on the Advanced Life Saving ECMO machine. ECMO pumps deoxygenated blood out of his body ,filters it, and returns it back into his artery. It functions as an artificial lung and heart because his lungs and heart was essentially not working.   With complications along the way, it was not looking good at all. He had very low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat in the 130's , MRSA infections, blood clots, and later on, a nosebleed that lasted about 10 days. The neurologist had to embolize and inject medicine from his leg catheter up to his nasal cavity in order to stop the bleeding. It made his recovery very difficult on top of everything else. The doctors told us that they have Austin on 3 forms of Life Support , but he is just not meeting us halfway.   Despite being in an induced COMA for 5 weeks, my brother did not give up. Prayers and support continued from friends, family and pastors as we did not give up HOPE.   After about 5 weeks in the ICU, there was finally some improvement. Austin was starting to respond to the treatments. His heart got stronger and they removed him from the heart ECMO and a few weeks later his lungs improved enough to be taken off the Lung ECMO. Miraculously by the Grace of God, he fought and fought and after 8 Intense weeks in the ICU , he was leaving ICU.  My brother was in Banner Hospital for a total of 80 days. He is now at a PT Rehab Center to regain strength and mobility.  God is the ULTIMATE HEALER and we truly believed that the Lord performed a MIRACLE on Austin. Austin has a tattoo on his arm of ""Isaiah 41:10"".  ""Do Not Fear, for I Am with you, Do not be Dismayed, For I am your God, I will Strengthen you and Help you, I will uphold you with my Righteous Right Hand"". It is clear that God has a plan for Austin here on earth. My brother's battle has been short of miraculous and I hope his story will touch the lives of those who read it and be a ray of Inspiration....   My brother is the ULTIMATE FIGHTER and the Tong Family want to thank the Medical Team of doctors and nurses at Banner for their utmost care and to all of our friends, family and pastors for their Love, prayers, support , and generosity.

At that time, it was also discovered the cancer had spread to Cory's lungs.Doctor's at Mount Sinai hospital in Toronto moved quickly to treat Cory. A biopsy was performed, and Cory started chemo in January 2021. Last week, the Doctors performed an emergency amputation due to the condition of his leg. Because the chemo is working for his lungs, the risk of stopping chemo and repairing his badly infected leg outweighed amputating. His left leg was amputated above his knee Friday, February 26th. Cory is still in the hospital recovering from this traumatic experience, and will begin rehab, and continue with chemo, over the next weeks and months.We, his family, are raising funds to cover the costs of future prosthetics, rehabilitation, medical equipment, and other unforeseen costs that arise. Because Cory wasn't working leading up to his diagnosis due to the pain in his leg, he does not currently have any Benefits to cover these costs.Cory is a son, a father, a brother, an uncle, a nephew, a cousin, and a great friend. He is always the first to support his friends and family during difficult situations, and we are rallying to raise funds to support him during this critical time.

I visited Sarara camp two years ago, spending almost a month living amongst the Samburu tribe and was deeply moved by the experience. The Samburu are beautiful, kind semi-nomadic people who devote their time to conservancy efforts in their Kenyan wilderness. Pius will have to completely reinvent his life going forward, and he'll need significant resources both for his care and his rehab.If you can imagine how challenging it will be for Pius to navigate his world livingin a very remote, isolated part of Kenya and wheelchair bound... then I'm sure you'll want to join me in this worthy effort to help make the road ahead just a little easier for him.Pius just recently attained the status of warrior. The Samburu, known as the butterfly people due to their bright and colourful clothing, live in small groups in temporary villages, tending cattle and goats and moving locations as resources dictate.Once completely nomadic, many of the younger Samburu now find work in the game parks and safari camps that focus on protecting the unique and rare wildlife in the area, such as elephants, giraffe, buffalo and rhinos. Pius works in Sarara Camp, a remote and beautiful elephant sanctuary and wildlife viewing safari destination located in Kenya’s Mathews ranges. His schedule has been to work for weeks at the camp, primarily in the kitchen, then travel by foot back to his village to reconnect with family and friends, help tend his animals, and to take on the responsibilities of his newly acquired role as a 'warrior'.A few weeks ago, on the last day of camp before the rainy season closing, Pius was walking alongside the pool at Sarara when he slipped, striking his head on concrete before falling unconscious into the water. Because most of the other workers do not swim, they immediately raced to alert Katie, the camp organiser, of the unfolding emergency.Katie pulled Pius from the water and resuscitated him, though it was clear his injuries were serious and that he would require immediate medical attention. Given the remote location of Sarara, they had to drive him several hours in a jeep over rugged back country terrain to reach first responder care in Nanyuki, the nearest town with a small hospital. Sadly, examination revealed that Pius had sustained a broken neck and severe spinal cord injuries, leaving him essentially with quadriplegia and with the use of just one arm. Living in a country which lacks ready access to many modern conveniences, this sort of injury is devastating for Pius. Unable to work and incapable of making his way to his nomadic village, his only option is to betaken back to Sarara to be cared for by Katie and Jeremy, camp managers, and the Samburu staff.His needs with this disability will be manyfold: Of course, a wheelchair—perhaps electric, certainly modified for the uneven terrain at camp—as well as countless medical supplies (catheters, continence pads, pads for pressure sores, antibiotics etc). In order to maximize the chance of regaining some use of limbs during his recovery, he’ll need physical therapy, too, a service that will of necessity be provided on site at camp by a professional hired for that purpose. Sarara, under the tireless work of hosts Katie and Jeremy, does exceptional conservation and orphaned-animal husbandry. Though they’re willing and engaged caregivers, responsibility for the care of Pius will certainly place extra workload on their already-full plates.Receiving funding to help in Pius’ recovery and longer-term care will go a long way in helping relieve that burden and will ensure he receives the best possible attention going forward. Sarara’s intent is to have Pius serve in some capacity at the camp, once he’s fully healed, but until then Pius is facing a long, expensive and especially challenging near-term road.""Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed, citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has."" -Margaret MeadPlease note: All donations will benefit Pius directly and will be distributed through the registered Sarara Foundation NPO. His immediate needs, such as an electric wheelchair, necessary medications, and specialized equipment for his spinal cord injury (SCI) will be dealt with first. His ongoing care, daily medications, physio, future operations, etc, will be met with funds raised and kept in trust by Sarara Foundation.Thank you all for your generosity and kindness for Pius. Every donation makes a difference and gives him the best chance of recovery from this devastating injury.Several photos credit: Ami Vitale / Thomas A. Stafford/ Selengei

It started with four friends, a mini bus, and plan to hunt elk for the first time in Idaho. However, the trip of a lifetime was cut short when an elk found them first in Montana.

Austin, Branden, Spencer, and Ryan were driving to Idaho for a hunting trip in the early hours of October 10th when an elk came into the road. Their mini bus camper hit the elk, lost control, and went off an embankment. 

All seriously injured they were rushed to a nearby hospital in Miles City, MT and then promptly transferred to Billings, MT when it was clear their injuries were too severe to be treated in Miles City.From Billings, MT it was assessed that Branden and Spencer would need to be transferred again in order to get the treatment they needed. They were then transported to Salt Lake City, UT.Below is where each of our friends are at in their recovery. We will continue to update the below with more details on their progress. So please check back!Austin:Being treated at Billings Clinic Hospital, Billings, MT. He has broken vertebrae in his lower back, a broken pelvis, and broken sternum. He has had one surgery already for his back on Saturday, 10/10. He is scheduled for another surgery Monday, 10/12 for his pelvis. After his second surgery there will be more details on recovery and rehab.Ryan:Being treated at St. Vincent Hospital, Billings, MT. He has sustained neck, upper back, and leg injuries. He has broken vertebrae in his upper neck and back, as well as a broken tibia. He will need surgery for his leg scheduled for Monday 10/12. More details on his stay and recovery will come after his surgery.Branden:Being treated at University of Utah Hospital, Salt Lake City, UT.He has sustained head and lower back injuries. He has broken vertebrae in his lower back, a broken orbital, sternum, and toe. He had surgery for his back on Sunday10/11 coming out of surgery they will do more chest x-rays and monitor his head injuries.Spencer:Being treated at University of Utah Hospital, Salt Lake City, UT.He sustained head, neck, and back injuries. He has had surgery for the broken vertebrae in his back overnight late Saturday 10/10. They will then check his head and neck injuries and continue to monitor. He also has a broken bone below his eye that will need to be looked at closer to home.Please know they are all conscious and communicating at various levels with their loved ones with them at the hospital.Knowing the boys all have a long road to recovery we would like to help relieve some of the stress associated with medical expenses thus far. All money raised will be split evenly among the boys. Any amount helps, but understand times are tough right now for a lot of us during the pandemic.The pandemic also means it is not possible to gather in-person for fundraisers so wehave created a GFM page so it is still possible to support them on their journey to recovering. They are so grateful for the outpouring of love and support they and their families have received this far. They can all feel it even from half way across the country. Please keep the thoughts, prayers, and kind words coming!

With that said - let's help crush their medical bills like a case of Busche Latte!For additional background: Leah Wainwright is a lifelong friend and grew up with all four men. Kayla McLain (formerly Nystrom) is the sister of Ryan and also life long friend to the other three men. A bank account (ABSR Recovery Road Fund) has been set up at Stephenson National Bank and Trust.  Kayla will deposit the donations from GoFundMe directly to the account to disperse between the four men.If you would like to donate, but do not feel comfortable doing so online, please contact Leah Wainwright via the contact button below directly for other ways to give. You can also contact Kayla or any other friends/family for more info as well.If you choose to write a check and drop it off at any of the Stephenson National Bank and Trust Branches - Please make checks payable to ABSR RECOVERY ROAD FUND.

The disease has been extremely debilitating and done a number on her body, sight, and mobility. She has persevered to serve others throughout her lifelong career in social work and volunteerism. Her career spanned 40 years of service at Western State Hospital as a Social Worker, Director of Admissions, and Emergency Management Planner. An inspiration to everyone who knows her, Susan, a legacy Red Crosser, followed in the footsteps of her Mother, Marie Roversi Tydings, who served in WWll aiding the troops in Europe. Susan spent years as a volunteer, doing Disaster Relief through the Red Cross. Despite her disability, fatigue, and pain, she lived for weeks in tents and sleeping on floors to clothe, feed and care for those who lost everything in the immediate aftermath of countless devastating storms and natural disasters. In her late 50's and early 60's, Susan trained and was EMT-certified. She was a volunteer EMT First Responder that ran with the Waynesboro Rescue Squad until her RA and vision limitations became too great. She constantly says how much she misses the Red Cross, Rescue Squad, and Social Work. She also served on numerous boards and committees to benefit the local Waynesboro community, which she so dearly loves.Susan is now completely blind in both eyes and, after numerous falls and 7 major orthopedic surgeries over the past several years, is now in a wheelchair and dependent on others for all mobility. Her most recent fall in August resulted in a severely broken femur which she is struggling to overcome. While in a rehab program, she contracted Covid 19, which severely limited her strength and ability to rehab properly. She is now also suffering from suspected Lewy Body Dementia. Susan's care needs are so great that she recently moved into a fulltime assisted living facility without her devoted husband, Jerry. Jerry cared for her from home for as long as he could, but it has finally become too much. Jerry is also suffering from Dementia and needs help himself. He can no longer live on his own either, despite how badly he’d like to. The facility has agreed to let Jerry move into a private room with her. This is wonderful news, but extremely expensive. The family is looking for financial help to pay for their fulltime care and to buy a handicap accessible van.As Susan’s loved ones and community, it is our turn to take care of someone who has spent her lifetime caring for everyone else, and help Jerry and her kids give her the care and comfort she deserves.Read more"

He did not return home that evening or the following morning. We began searching frantically and filed a missing person’s report. Unbeknownst to us, Sean had already been found and transported to Shock Trauma in Baltimore sometime Wednesday afternoon. He has suffered a gun-shot wound and as a result has a traumatic brain injury. He remains in shock trauma. While he has made some neurological progress like wiggling toes, giving thumbs up, trying to open his eyes, etc. it is still touch and go and we have not yet been given a prognosis for his future. Sean will continue to undergo a series of cognitive and physical evaluations to better determine his progress. Right now it’s a waiting game. The next few days/weeks are sure to be a series of a few steps forward and a few steps back off and on as his body tries to figure out what’s going on. We have all been googling and reading success stories of other people with similar injuries and it is those miracles that are giving us hope! What we do know is that no matter the outcome, it will be a very long hard road ahead with therapy, rehab and recovery. We are all hoping and praying for a miracle, but most of us are grappling with the realization that while he may physically be the Sean we all know and love as a husband, son, father, brother or friend; it’s quite likely that his future (and the future of his family) will be drastically changed forever. Sean has always had a love for life be it spending time with his wife and children, golf, poker, snowboarding or playing pool. His love and ambition is endless! Sean and Docia are high school sweet hearts and have built a beautiful life and family together. Throughout the trials and tribulations they have always been by one another’s side and managed to overcome whatever obstacles have been thrown their way. This time no different – Theirs is a relationship that exhibits the true meaning of “in sickness and in health”. I can’t think of many times when either of them has reached out for help, but now it is time. We all need to pull together and help them in any way we can. Their family is loved by so many and each friend/family member brings a special gift to them and their family. We all need to pitch in and lift them up in helping them get through the tough times ahead. Sean and Docia have both always worked hard to support their family and provide a comfortable life for their children, Tyler and Bella. Unfortunately, a few months ago Docia lost her job and has not yet found new employment. Even before these tragic events, it was a huge strain on their family to go from two incomes to one. The bills have already been mounting and now resources are sure to be stretched even further. They are only covered by medical insurance through the end of February. At that time alternative options will need to be put into place. Sean is going to need round the clock care for quite some time and it’s a very real possibility that Docia may not be able to re-enter the workforce until Sean is in a more manageable state. It is also not likely that Sean will be able to work for many months, if ever. The financial burden of medical bills is just beginning and is sure to be a mountain in no time. Please keep praying, sending positive vibes and lifting this whole family up! Please share this GoFundMe page and donate if you can. No amount is too little. We love each of you so much and are so grateful to have your support in this tragic time of need. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.Read more"

Thank you for taking the time to read and consider donating to our fund. For those of you who don't know me, my name is Ashley and I am starting this GoFundMe for an amazing woman who started out as a neighbor and ended up like a second mother to me and a grandma to my kids. Charlene Levin is one of the most generous people I know. When I was a single mom, she watched my kids while I worked 10 hour days and only asked for $20 in return (which basically covered snacks she fed my kids and gas for taking them to their afterschool activities). She did this for over 3 years until her brother and sister-in-law moved in with her full time who are each battling serious illnesses. Charlene has been caring for them for over a year.Charlene's husband, Mike Levin, had a stroke on October 28th and was in ICU for 5 weeks. When Mike started to show some improvement, they sent him to rehab but, unfortunately, he was only there for 1 day before he pulled out his feeding tube and they sent him back to the hospital. From there, his kidneys started to fail and his heart rate was all over the place. Charlene was only allowed minimal visits with Mike during this time due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The doctors recommended at this point to focus on Mike's quality of life. The options at the time were to be bedridden in a nursing home where visitors would not be allowed, or bring him home to be around his loved ones. Charlene chose to bring Mike home so they could spend the rest of his days together. For 10 days, Charlene took care of Mike around the clock, with some help from in-home hospice care. When Charlene could not longer handle the 24/7 constant care Mike required anymore, she had to make the difficult decision to send him to the hospice tranquility center. There she was able to be with Mike every day until he passed away on Christmas morning 11 days later.Mike was a school bus driver for Cobb County School District and was the main financial provider for their family. Charlene is retired. As you can imagine, the household bills are starting to pile up and the hospital bills will be coming in soon. Mike wished to be cremated which will cost $850 alone. My goal is to raise at least this much to cover the expense. All other donations will go towards hospital bills and any other unexpected costs that comes with losing a loved one.With all that Charlene has been through with the loss of her husband, and still being the main caregiver for her brother and sister-in-law, I want to do anything I can to help take care of the financial burden. No one should have to worry about how they are going to pay to cremate their partner. If you can give ANY AMOUNT, please donate to our fund. If you cannot afford to donate, please send prayers, good vibes, or you can get in touch with me if you would like to send flowers, donate a meal, write a card or anything else you can think of. I'd be happy to help arrange and deliver anything you would like to gift her with. Thank you all for your support and PLEASE give if you can.

Hello and thank you for even venturing to this page. For any of you who knows our beloved mother, grandmother, great grandmother, wife and sister Shirley Jenks, you already know how loving and caring this young woman is. She is such a strong foundation in our family and always has been this to us. Unfortunately life happened on the morning of 8/9/17 and my grandmother Shirley had a stroke that has severly debilitated the entire right side of her body that she will have to work ferociously to regain strength and balance in her right side. For anyone that has had to endure physical therapy from a significant debilitation, it is one of the toughest and most challenging things not just physically but mentally that one can endure. 
  She has put so much time, effort and most importantly love into our family for her entire existence it has been such a blessing to us to have her in our lives. During such a trying time the last thing anyone wants to have to worry about is expenses and the stressthat such an issue can cause. Shirley has willingly housed many of her children and grandchildren, siblings and more for years long after ages that should be necesary and she has never asked for anything in return for such generosity. She has such a beautiful faith in God and has worked endless hours volunteering not only for family but for anyone that has ever been in need.
   She has medicare currently and her responsibility of the bill will be 20% of all expenses charged and although the initial sum that is our goal to raise is set we are really unsure what the true cost will be so any donation is greatly appreciated and your generosity will not be forgotten. She is spending over 4-6 days in an acute hospital and will be going to physical rehab as planned now for 7-14 days depending on her rate of recovery. Not including if there will be any necessary expenses to have a home health nurse assist us at home.
  It is such a terrible event but such a blessing to have the love and support surrounding us in such a stressful time when we need to continue to try and keep this as stress-free as possible at least for Shirley to not exacerbate her condition. Even the smallest contribution will be welcomed and such an enormous help.God bless and much LOVEfrom our family to yours.

That night, we were told by doctors to either consider organ donation or prepare for him to be in a vegetative state if he ever came out of his coma. It was the worst night of our family's lives. Cordy has always been a bright, intelligent, and caring young man full of personality and spunk. Anybody who knows Cordy will tell you that he could light up a room. Cordy was not only kind but he was also a very dedicated young man. Just before his accident, he was following his dreams and practicing to try out for a professional soccer team. Cordy was also only two classes away from achieving his bachelor’s degree in Business Administration. He had so much going for him and it all came to a halt. Cordy suffered a traumatic brain injury and was in a coma three months. He also suffered from a severe open fracture on his right arm. Surgery was performed and doctors managed to save his right.On February 1, 2016, Cordy was airlifted to Texas Neuro-Rehab Center in Austin, TX where he would undergo physical, speech and occupational therapy. As he slowly began to regain consciousness, we were able to see his condition more clearly. Despite what doctors had told us, Cordy pushed through and fought hard to come back to us. Although he is a different Cordy. He is learning to do everything all over again. At first he could not walk, talk, eat or perform even the most basic functions. But he hasn't given up and neither will we. Thankfully he has been backed by a dedicated and loving support system. Cordy's condition is slowly improving and he is learning how to eat and speak again. We have begun to see a little bit more of our Cordy as his condition improves. He constantly mutters to his mom “I want to walk.” He is trying so hard and always seems so hopeful for a better future. Everyday he acknowledges how grateful he is that God gave him this second chance. Cordy is not mobile yet and suffers from stiffness, inaudible speech and involuntary movements caused by the brain damage he endured. He is also hearing impaired from his left ear and partially in his right because of the accident. With therapy and time we are hopeful that Cordy's mobility, speech and hearing will return.Doctors and therapists at the Texas Neuro Rehab Center did all that they could to help but unfortunately due to insurance purposes, Cordy could not continue with the therapy he needs. We have sought help from DARS (Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services) but funding is not and has not been available for almost three months.Cordy was sent to a nursing home in McAllen to receive care, with minimal therapy. Cordy needs post-acute neurological care that is not available in the valley. He is not ready to give up and we are definitely not giving up on him. We are determined to get Cordy the treatment he needs so that he can have the future that he deserves. We are hoping to raise funds for Cordy’s care along with any ADA modifications that he will need in his home. His care is estimated to be about $1,000 a day and he'll need this care for three months. These unfortunate circumstances have also caused his mother to take a long leave of absence from her career in order to care for Cordy. If he is able to receive the neurological rehab care that he needs, his mother will leave work again to be by his side as she has been from day one. We are asking for any donations to assist in getting him the treatment he so desperatelyneeds. Since I (his sister) live in Oklahoma, Khiabet, his girlfriend and caretaker, will be accepting the donations and ensuring that these funds are used for Cordy. Even the smallest donation goes a long way. Another way you can help is to share his story.We greatly appreciate your love, support and prayers.￼￼Read more"

It all started just before midnight on February 2, 2021. My mother, Annette, unfortunately fell down the basement stairs, hitting her head on a small metal box at the bottom. Thankfully, I was upstairs and still awake, so I heard when she fell. When I ran down to check on her, she was unresponsive. An ambulance was called, and she was rushed to Barnes Jewish Hospital. The neurosurgeons there performed emergency lifesaving surgery to relieve the building intracranial pressure. They removed coagulated blood as well as a sizeable portion of her skull to allow room for the brain to swell, and ultimately she was diagnosed with severe traumatic brain injury with extensive bruising and swelling of the right side of her brain.



Annette then spent 17 days in Barnes Neuro ICU where she was cared for by an amazing team of doctors, nurses, therapists, and staff. While there, they transitoned her from a breathing tube to a trache collar, and even weaned her off the ventilator. They also switched her from an oral feeding tube to a G-tube.







Eventually, she was declared stable and transferred to Kindred St. Louis, a Long Term Acute Care Hospital. The Kindred team has been very helpful and understanding, and Mom has made several baby steps in her recovery, including having the trache removed and even talking some.











Though what she says doesn't always make sense at this point; she is definitely, slowly, regaining awareness of the world around her and is starting to communicate some of her needs and desires. She's also started occupational, physical, and speech therapy. Soon she'll be transferred to either a skilled nursing facility or an inpatient rehab facility to continue her recovery journey from traumatic brain injury.



Annette's road to recovery will be a long one; that much is certain. Unfortunately, with a long recovery comes numerous expenses that our family simply can't afford. That is exactly why Angels for Annette is being set up. Any funds donated will be used to cover expenses related to her treatment and recovery. It will be used to pay for the surgeries, therapies, equipment, ambulance transportation, facilities, etc. necessary to get Annette back up and on her feet again.



That very first night in the ER, one of the surgical nurses took some time to talk to me. She said, 'With injuries like this it's best not to think of her health as a straight path from trauma to being better. Rather, it's a long, slow, winding road. There will be bumps, detours, twists and turns, and it will take a quite a while, but eventually she'll get to whatever point recovery is for her.'



That doesn't mean she'll be the same as she once was, and we may have to figure out what her new 'normal' is. But along the way, we can do everything we can to help. With a donation, no matter how big or how small, we ask that you become an Angel for Annette. Help make that winding road just a little bit smoother, and help keep the destination somewhere worth reaching. Not only would you be helping Annette, but also our family as a whole to get through this hard time. So, if you can, please consider giving. We would be profoundly grateful.Even if you don't end up donating, we as a family appreciate even being considered. So from the bottom of our hearts, Thank You. ❤





Sincerely,



Allison (Annette's daughter) and Dave (Annette's husband)





P.S. - At the time of creating this gofundme, the goal amount of $3000 is just a general estimate. I plan on adjusting it as the bills come pouring in and we have more concrete numbers available.

She was born on September12, 2020 at 31 weeks, weighing in at 2.5 lbs. Her diagnosis is Trisomy 21, more commonly known as Down Syndrome. This little blessing has already endured more in her 3 short months than most have in a lifetime. She has yet to come ""home"" to where her family lives in Mineola, NY. She has not met her 4 older siblings as they are not allowed to visit her during these unprecedented times. She has not left the High Risk NICU at Cohens Children's Hospital, her temporary home for now. Today, she had her first surgery of a few to come, for what is called Laryngomalacia, a Congenital Malformation of the larynx and trachea. She has been struggling to breath on her own for months now and keeping food down has been a challenge. Pending her progress, she will be moved to St. Mary's Children's Hospital in Queens for Rehab for an indefinite amount of time. When she is stronger, she will be transported back to Cohens Hospital to have open heart surgery to repair an AV Canal Defect. She has a very long road ahead of her to say the least.Her mom, Stacey, has been back and forth to the hospital every single day, feeding her, loving her and being her advocate, communicating with the doctors for her treatment plan. She spends upwards of 6-8 hours in the evening, sometimes not coming home until the early morning hours. She then spends some time with her other children before they head off to school. It's sleep for a handful of hours, wakes up to work, spend what little time she has left with her family before she heads back to the hospital. The stress and strain she and her family are under is indescribable. When Hannah goes to the rehab, Stacey will have to move in with her, because in these times, there is no going back and forth for visits. She will have to work part time in order to be with Hannah. Her husband James has taken on the brunt of the home situation, and they have had to hire a 2nd person to help with the children who range in age from 18mts to 8yo, in addition to working a full time job. He juggles sports, cub scouts, doctor appointments and daily life with 4 kids. Things have become extremely tough and medical bills are piling up.Stacey and James have always and continue to help in the community. They have forever had an open door policy, constantly being inclusive in all they do. There's always some sort of post saying ""come one, come all"" for Birthdays, Halloween, whatever it might be, the Tracy Family has always had a love for community. Stacey has spent countless hours driving around, dropping off cheer and happiness to children, especially when COVID hit, helping children in the community smile, using her PTA as a cover. But it was her and James who were the masterminds behind that. James is a Cub Scout leader who despite what's happening and how busy he is, always makes time for meetings and events because it means so much to the children. They are the first ones to step up to support their friends. We'd like to support them for medical assistance, and to make sure their children at home are getting all they need at this time. As a community, we can help them alleviate their present financial burden and what lies ahead. We want Hannah to come home and meet her siblings under the best circumstances possible.Read more"

My father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and within months passed away. In the wake of his death I had to leave home in Chicago and move to Mississippi where I could inherate his small business and keep life afloat for my mother in his stead. At the same time, I developed a strange pain in my stomach that I naturally assumed was stress and just kept moving forward.As time went on the pain grew and grew. I tried diet changes, hydration and stress management. Which was nearly impossible while juggling the responsibilities of my father and his small business while coping with his death and coping with the sudden shock of uprooting my entire life amungst those circumstances. My dad was my rockAbout a year later the pains grew into heart attacks. Three heart attacks, three ER visits and two EKG’s showed there was nothing actually wrong. But the attacks still came. Now however, they came with panic attacks and terror because the professionals say there is no apparent cause. Anything I eat. Anything I drink. Any way I stand, or sit and any way I sleep causes immediate sharp pain that is now taking over one whole side of my body, my back and my chest. Massive attacks multiple times a day until the last few weeks when it’s all grown into one constant state of immeasurable pain.All the same things my father went through before finding out it was cancer.Finally last week and ONLY with the help from a dear friend in the medical field, telling me the SPECIFIC vocabulary to legally obligate the hospital to run specific tests on me, did I find out that I have been suffering from Biliary Colic and that my gallbladder absolutely needs to come out. It’s too far gone to be healed with a diet change but according to the doctor, since I don’t have insurance, it isn’t life threatening enough yet for them to do the surgery with out a guarantee of payment.By the time the doctor left the room it was laid out plain as day that the only options I have are to either develop a massive infection or my gallbladder has to rupture for them to move forward without that payment guarantee. Ironically, when the pain originally started I was still insured but as times changed my premiums went from $300 a month to $700 a month and I can’t afford to pay a second rent that is essenctially on my own body. Now the only ways to schedule the surgery are to be approved by vocational rehab (which the doctor and staff already said I don’t qualify for since I am actually ABLE to make payments but apparently not able enough to gaurentee the payments) or paying outright (which requires at least an $8000 down payment upfront). The payments, I can make. The down payment, I can not. Since my dad died all my life has been is taking care of the living expenses and wellbeing of my mom by maintaining all the stresses of a business I wasn’t mentally prepared to take on while also managing a mysterious excruciating pain.This link tells the story about what was once my fathers small Italian restaurant but is now top 50 in the countryBut with everything I’ve done so far, it’s still only enough to keep the roof over our heads. Now though, I’m unable to work because of the mounting pain.I admit that the stress, pressure and fear are closing in on me.I have no idea where to turn and no idea what to do. I’m afraid I’ll have to wait until something truly terrible happens inside of my body before I can get any help but I can’t even work enough to live that long anymore. All I can pray for is this somehow makes a dent in that down payment . Any amount of it I can bring down gets me that much closer to being alive again. I hope to take the steps to get myself better now and continue to work hard for my family with my full energies, concentration and spirit. Ihope to find a solution while it’s still “easy” to fix. Before it turns into something I only *might* survive.I want to give my mom the life she’s always deserved.Thank you for spending a moment learning my story. Any help you can give, even just sharing my story, will be a blessing for me, my family and my working family.PS: I’ll personally give my vintage Alf and Harry Potter memorbelia to random contributors if that’s REALLY what it has come down to!Read more"

On Sunday night around 9/9:30 Janet had a stroke. She was taken by ambulance to the Delta Community hospital. They administered TPA, a massive blood thinner which came with it's own risks. She was completely non communicative and her right side was lacking in coordination. She was taken by helicopter to Utah Valley Hospital where she's been in the Neuro ICU. Because of the TPA she had to remain laying down flat for 24 hrs so an MRI had to wait until this morning. Shortly after they gave her the TPA she was able to say a word here and there. By last night she was able to speak in sentences again. She will require speech therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. She has a long road ahead of her but I know she's a fighter and a very determined one at that!!

They determined that she has PFO ( a hole in her heart) but aren't convinced it's the only contributing factor. They are running blood panels to see if there are other indicators. She'll go from the hospital in a few days to acute rehab for 1 to 2 weeks depending on her progress. (I'm saying less than a week )She's making great strides already in her recovery. They also believe it was one large clot that broke up in the brain and sent several smaller clots throughout her brain damaging seven different areas. THANK YOU ALL for your love and support emotionally. It has been felt. I know God hears and answers prayers. I know our Grandpa is with her helping and comforting her, along with other family members.

Janet does not have medical insurance and at this time we are asking for donations to ease the burden. ANYTHING HELPS!Janet is a mother of 10 with 3 small Children at home. Janet is always donating her time and willing to help anyone with anything, she is a shinning light in the darkness. She is an amazing Baker who find so much Joy in baking and cooking for anyone.

She was in the ICU at Cedars-Sinai for weeks due to brain bleeding and swelling, pneumonia, followed by a brain infection. On July 14th, after nearly two months in the hospital, Ashley was stable enough to fly home with her mother and sister to continue her recovery in Texas. She has required 24/7 supervision, nightly antibiotic injections, twelve daily prescriptions and daily rehab.This horrific situation has been life altering for Ashley, her mother and her two sisters. Her round-the-clock medical care and multiple surgeries have been extremely expensive --- extended hospital stays, travel back and forth from CA to TX, moving out of her LA apartment, continuous one-on-one rehab, prescriptions, blood draws, daily injections, and so much more. We still are not sure how much Ashley will owe out of pocket for the millions of dollars of surgeries including the upcoming surgery and hospital stay.Ashley’s family have been extremely involved with her daily care. Ashley’s father passed away two years ago, after a ten-year home stay due to early onset Alzheimer’s. Her mother and younger sister took care of him during that time.Any donation amount helps! Ashley has made an amazing recovery so far considering the severe traumatic brain injury. However she still has to have another surgery to close her skull and needs rehab and other specialty care.

The hospital bills themselves are going to be outrageous as well as the continuing care and rehab. Her mother and support team will be moving into a new home with Kima to help care for her.

He was a born a healthy 8 lbs 8oz after a speedy delivery.While Ryder is doing great, the new Mom has had a tougher road since his birth. Less than 24 hours after delivery, Molly suffered a stroke, and after emergency surgery, was placed in a medically induced coma. At just under 3 weeks post-partum, the Harrison family is facing a lot of unknowns and a long road to recovery. The details: Molly had pre-eclampsia (a condition during pregnancy with high blood pressure) when she went to the hospital in labor. The day after his delivery, Molly then developed a very rare but life-threatening condition – HELLP syndrome – which resulted in a large bleed on the right side of her brain. Luckily, as Molly was confused and somnolent, an OB/GYN resident realized what was happening quickly. A neurosurgeon was called and Molly was taken for emergent surgery to take part of her skull off to allow the swelling in her brain to happen without further damage. Molly was then kept in a medically induced coma for several days to help her brain heal. During this time Molly was very ill and many of her organs shut down (including her kidneys; she needed several blood transfusions and many medications).Since this time, Molly has woken up and it is unclear what the future holds for her. While she was initially confused and missing large chunks of her memory, she seems to be making rapid progress. She will require at least several weeks to months of inpatient rehab focusing on cognitive therapies. Unfortunately, the closest neuro-rehab facility is in Edison (about an hour away) and will place an additional burden on the new family. Molly will also require many specialist appointment, outpatient therapies, and medications after being discharged home. She will need another surgery in about 3 months of have her skull replaced (and until this time she has to wear a protective helmet while out of bed).While we are all hopeful for a full recovery, we are unsure of many variables, including how long Molly will be in inpatient rehab, insurance coverage, and if Molly will be able to able to return to work, and/or take care of herself and Ryder when she does go home. We are hoping this will ease some of the burden in her journey towards recovery. Thank you all in advance for your support!Read more"

He is the 3rd oldest child in our family of 7 kiddos. He was the victim of a shooting on Friday, January 29, 2021 and has suffered a spinal cord injury (SCI). We have been told that he is neurologically presenting as a quadriplegic, and he is on a ventilator. We appreciate all of the prayers, love and care that everyone has shown. If you have the means to help financially during this difficult time, we would really appreciate it. Every little bit will help. Thank you so much for your care and consideration! If you cannot afford to donate, we ask that you would send your prayers, light a candle, and/or send loving thoughts his way. He needs our love and support desperately. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, we have not even been able to go in to see our baby boy. If you could pray for our family as well, we would really appreciate it. Please see below for more information on our ask.Current Immediate NeedWe need to raise about 35k for in-home rehab equipment, 15-20k to make our downstairs livable for DJ (including ramps, entry/exit modifications, hallway and door modifications, washroom install/modifications as all of our bedrooms and bathrooms are on our 2nd story and already full of kiddos), and another 25-30k for a vehicle outfitted to transport a full body tilt chair. He is still presenting neurologically as a C3 injury so will need accommodations as such.About DJ's InjuryThe bullet passed through his arm, went through his chest, and is now located in his spinal cord at the T3 level. The bullet missed his heart, but has caused damage to his left lung, and the vessels and nerves in his arm were also damaged. He currently does not have any sensory or motor function below his level of injury and is being classified as a Grade A on the ASIA Impairment Scale. He is currently in critical condition in the trauma-ICU. They have decided not to remove the bullet at the hospital he is currently at stating that the literature supports leaving it in the spinal canal. There have been debates for decades on whether or not removal improves outcome with many doctors on either side of the fence. We have had further consults with outside providers that believe he may have added benefit from the bullet being removed. Some of the benefits of removal are preventing further damage from things such as bone fragments, migration, and toxicity due to the lead content of the bullet, as well as to try to reduce the risk of other things such as post traumatic syringomyelia (PTS). While there are also risks with removal (and with any surgery), they tend to be significantly less in the T-spine compared to the C-spine due to location. However, these must also be taken into account. If the bullet remains, it may exclude DJ from elective and experimental rehab therapies that are cutting edge in the treatment of spinal cord injury. We would really like him to have the option for removal, if he chooses to do so. However, this is not the current fundraising focus as there are more pressing current needs.More About DJ's Financial NeedsThere is a misconception, even in the medical community, of what is covered by insurance when it comes to spinal cord injuries. DJ's insurance should cover most of his current in-patient trauma based medical care which is primarily focused on getting him out of the hospital alive and in a tilt chair. However, insurance will not cover things that are necessary for DJ to stay safe and healthy such as a vehicle for transportation (we live in a rural area with no access to public transportation), home modifications, and/or any in-patient elective (or even some non-elective) or rehab programs in or out-of-state that have helped other people gain function, nor will it cover the expenses of access to spinal rehab and devices that may prove to be extremely beneficial to his care and improve his function both in the short-term and in the long-term and also improve his quality of life. Either way, he is facing a very long road ahead of him.Messages from his family:From DJ's Mom, Anna: This is a parent's worst nightmare. Due to COVID, we are not allowed in the hospital to able to see DJ and to care for him like every parent wants to. I cannot hold his hand, kiss his face or calm him down. We also cannot speak with the doctor's face to face, which has led to confusion and chaos. While I understand the necessity of these stipulations during the pandemic, it has been truly heartbreaking to know that he is lying there, not knowing what is happening, strapped to a hospital bed, being intubated, and not knowing what to expect and why he cannot feel his legs. I hope they find the people who did this and stop them from ever hurting someone like this again. They have taken away his ability to move anything below T3 and his left hand grip. He can only rely on his right hand at the time being. It is my hope to provide DJ with the ABSOLUTE best care and best chance at restoring as much function as possible. He is only 20 yrs. old and needs our help! This kid has a HUGE heart!!! I appreciate all of the prayers, love and care that everyone has shown. If you have the means to help financially during this difficult time, we would really appreciate it. Anything will help, as this is a pretty life-altering event. Thank you so much for your care and prayers. Please continue to send them our way!From DJ's Eldest Brother, Tyler 23 yrs.: I just want him to have his best fighting chance. Anything you can do to help... we are hoping and praying for miracles.From DJ's Sister, Bella, 14 yrs.: I want my brother to have the best care. If you can, please help him get care that may help him. I am worried about his life and how this will be for him. I think this would help him mentally and physically. Mentally is probably the worst for him.From DJ's Youngest Sister Eva, 9 yrs.: I just want my brother to get better. I love him so much. He means so much to me. Please pray.From DJ's Youngest brother Brendan, 12 yrs.: Me and my family were on zoom this afternoon, and I saw that my brother was in a position where he cannot move anything and that made me sad. I think that if we raise money, maybe we can help him. would you pray for my brother DJ?From DJ's Stepdad, Kelii: This just sucks. It is the saddest thing I have ever witnessed. We were able to finally see him this afternoon on video, and he is able to write with his right hand on a white board. He is intubated, so could not talk and became so emotional at his Mom's voice that it became hard for him to breathe. He was worried about us and everyone else and was worn out pretty fast. This kid deserves a miracle. Deserves people to believe in him. He deserves the world. Thank you for all of your prayers.Thank you all for taking the time to support DJ. If you would like to leave him a note that we can read to him when things are hard both now and in the future, please do so. Every thought, prayer and well wish means the world right now.Read more"

From the start she was calm, content and a great sleeper. I was so lucky and happy to be a mom. The first 3 months of her life were quite typical- 2 month needles, smiling, tummy time, batting at toys and following me with her eyes every minute.  One night, a typical night like one we had so many times before, her dad came home from work and put her to bed while I had supper and a shower. Maggie woke up in the middle of the night, which was strange for her to do. When I got her from her crib, I knew right away something was wrong. I called 911 and an ambulance came and we went to the ER.  Before I knew it, we were on air ambulance to the major children’s hospital in Vancouver (Maggie was born in Comox, BC) and then came X rays, CTs, MRIs, intubations and more. Maggie was seizing uncontrollably and was unconscious. As they worked on her I was whisked away by police and doctors. I wasn’t sure why police were there. I was so confused and terrified that something was wrong with Maggie.  Maggie had multiple skull fractures, multiple rib fractures, a broken foot and a broken clavicle. Her brain was bleeding and her intracranial pressure was extremely high. She had 2 hemorrhagic strokes. She was admitted under “nonaccidental injury and traumatic brain injury”. She was 3 months old. Maggie’s father (my now ex-partner from that very date onward) had nearly beaten Maggie to death in her bedroom when I was in the shower, then laid her down in her crib to sleep so he wouldn’t “be caught” . He confessed in full, and after months of court proceedings, he was sentenced to 5 years of federal prison, which he is serving the last year of now, in northern BC, and will end up only serving 3/5 of his sentence, as is the norm, because of “overcrowding and such”. There isn’t enough time or paper to begin to even try to explain how all of this felt. The horror, the shock, the fear, the anger, it is beyond comprehension or description. I decided instantly that I was now a single mother and all I could do was think of Maggie.  The bleeding and pressure did subside, and surgery was not needed. A central vein IV was inserted because of all the meds she was getting, and a NG tube. I was told it may be 3-4 weeks in PICU before we would go up to the neurology floor.  Maggie was safe now, safe from a horrible threat I didn’t even know existed, with only me at her side. After less than 2 weeks, we moved up to neurology. The nurses called her Miracle Maggie, as she was so strong. They weaned the meds keeping her sedated and she started to become alert and awake. The NG tube came out. Again we were told it would be weeks on neurology. We were there for a week. The staff was so impressed with how determined and strong Maggie was. She started bottle feeding and moving her limbs. It was obvious that Maggie’s vision had not returned, and that made sense seeing as how the strokes were in her occipital lobe.  As she recovered in hospital for 3 weeks, and then in a hotel with me and my mother while we had follow up appts for another 3, I was granted full sole custody and guardianship of Maggie and all my ex-partner’s parental ties were severed. He was not allowed 25 feet near Maggie or me. We packed up and moved back to NL, where I am from and my family was, Maggie was just shy of 5 months. She was still blind and still having seizures. Over the last 4 years we have become well accustomed to the Janeway, pediatric rehab, neurology, neuropsychology, ophthalmology, physiotherapy, orthopedic surgeon, occupational therapy, cerebral palsy clinic, speech language pathology, the ER, CNIB, and many more. It was unclear how much damage was done to her brain and what the long term outcome would be. Maggie was now 6 months old and still non visual and still having seizures. Maggie truly is a miracle. Every day I am so grateful that she pulled through this horrendous attack, something no one, especially an infant, should ever endure. She remained the happy content girl she always was. I didn’t know what was to come, but I knew the reality of the brain damage meant developmental delays and the strokes meant vision loss. All I knew was, whatever came to be, it didn’t matter because she was alive.  I struggled for a long time with the fact that this was just so unfair. So unfair that she was going to have so many physical struggles and health problems because of what he did. It gets easier every day, and I have let it go slowly that this wasn’t the path her life was supposed to be on, in the sense that she was born healthy. It is never fair for a child to struggle, born with the issues or not. So I couldn’t let that fact keep me down. This was our life now, and we had to live it, happy and together us girls.  Maggie is now 4 years old. She has been diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy, Cortical Visual Impairment, Epilepsy, and Neurocognitive Disorder from a Traumatic Brain Injury. She goes to PT weekly, OT biweekly, speech weekly and swim therapy weekly. She is in daycare now that I am back to work. She is non-stop, crawling, climbing, laughing, playing and happy. It took months of work for her to gain the milestones that she has, and that is fine. We have our own milestone timeline now, as many parents of children with special needs may relate to. I did not think that I would be a single mother of a child with special needs. But such is life- the life that we share now together. It is with great pride that I write this, pride in the strength and love I see in her every day. I had to declare bankruptcy the end of the year we moved home from BC to NL. Despite working full time as a registered nurse, which I continue to do, the financial hardsips of moving from coast to coast, weeks in hotels in BC, and Maggie’s adaptive equipment, simply was too much to bare. Our life is not what I imagined, but I wouldn’t change a thing about my little darling girl. She has overcome so much and continues to amaze me every day. I learn from her so much and I cannot wait to see what her future will hold, though it may be a different future than expected it will be one of joy and happiness! We are happy and I love our life, but we simply are outgrowing the basement apartment we live in, but also cannot afford to buy/build an accessible house. A house that has no stairs and has wide doorways, a ramp at the entrances and wide hallways so she can use her walker safely at home. Safe and sturdy rails on the walls, bathtub and toilet, padded floors for the crawling, and large enough rooms for the walker use. Safety is such a priority for Maggie, as well as space to learn and grow, as for any child.My relative, David, approached me about writing this and using this site for help, which I humbly agreed to do. Maggie deserves the world, and she has surpassed all of my and her doctors and therapists expectations, and I want her to have the best in this world. She deserves it, for all she has been through, and for all the struggles she will continue to have as she grows and matures, she deserves a space of her own, that I can adapt as needed. She is such a happy girl, and that is what truly matters, but at this point in time, we are running out of space and safe living. I continue to work full time, but financially, as a single parent and of a child with multiple special needs, I am not at the level of buying a house.Our goal is to raise $75 000 as a down payment for a new house and to modify it as needed for Maggie's special needs. Thank you! Your help will make all the difference for Maggie and her future!Read more"

She kept both of these girls awake and talking to her the whole time until help arrived. Millicent broke her toe and is doing great under the circumstances. Jessica and London were both airlifted to UNC at Chapel Hill. Jessica suffered a broken femur and ankle, but is in good spirits and hopes to go home in the next few days.London, however, broke her neck, her shoulder, her back, has seven broken ribs, has countless lacerations throughout her body and is paralyzed from her waist down.

At first, I was hesitant about creating a Go Fund Me page due to the crisis we are all facing with the virus but I feel the need to do so, as my brother is very sick and has a long recovery ahead of him. We know for sure he will need a lot of therapy and will not be able to work for months or may not even return to work at all. On March 18th, 2020, Scott suffered a massive stroke due to an AVM (arteriovenous malformation) on his brain. He was rushed into emergency surgery and the doctors were not even sure if he would make it through that. Without surgery, Scott would have died. Since then he has had many setbacks. He has been on a ventilator since March 18th and has since developed a bacterial infection called Elizabethkingia Meningoseptic. He remains in the ICU on the ventilator. He has been running a fever with this as well. He had stomach issues which created abdominal distention which pushed on the lungs and made it even more difficult for him to breathe. He finally got through that set back.They now want to put him on a tracheostomy to assist him with his breathing and put a feeding tube in his stomach. We are just waiting for the doctors to believe he is strong enough to go through the surgery. This procedure will definitely help him to heal faster. The longer he is on the ventilator the worse it will be and can increase damage to his esophagus and diaphragm. The extended time on the ventilator could also result in additional bacterial infections from the tube that is going down his throat. Once he passes these hurdles, he will be in rehab facilities for many months. They are not sure as to what neurological damage has been done due to the stroke. We know his right side is paralyzed and he was only reacting to pricks and pinching. It also affected his speech.Since there have been no visitors allowed since March 19th it has been very difficult to not go and see him. Thank goodness for technology and the wonderful nursing staff, we have been able to face time with him twice a day. We appreciate all the care he has been given as well as all the other patients who are in the ICU due to the virus or other medical emergencies. God bless all Healthcare Staff throughout the world.Deb is back to work today. She has been quarantined for 14 days which her work requested since she was at the hospital with Scott when this happened. We totally understand her company’s decision due to the virus. Scott and Deb will be going through financial difficulty over the next several months due to Scott’s medical bills and him not being able to work. Deb is doing everything possible to make ends meet but she needs some help. She loves my brother so much and will do anything to get him through this. She has had many sleepless nights and still manages to keep it together with a smile on her face. I thank the Lord for her being there for him and encouraging Scott to keep fighting when she has her face time calls with him. Even though he cannot respond by talking, we know he recognizes us and blinks to commands. He even gave us a small smile last night when we face timed with him. These may be baby steps, but to our family it is huge progress.Our family thanks you all for any donations that are received. We will keep you updated on Scott’s progress. God bless you all. We hope and pray the best for everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.Love,Deb Parks and the family of Scott JahnkeRead more"

It was a Saturday night and he was going to meet his friends for dinner. As he made his way towards the restaurant, an altercation broke out between two men. Shots were fired. Andy turned to run away but was hit by one of the bullets in his back. He was an innocent victim to a senseless shooting and is now at risk of paralysis from the waist down.After being shot, Andy fell on the ground and immediately noticed that he could not feel his legs. He had the presence of mind to call one of the friends he was meeting for dinner, sent them a drop pin of his exact location, and then called 911. His friends ran to find and help him despite the mayhem all around them and a dead body lying a few feet away. These friends kept Andy calm and safe as the police and ambulances started to arrive.He was taken to SF General Hospital and needed a life-saving operation. The bullet tore his diaphragm, destroyed his spleen and caused significant damage to his spine.Upon waking from the anesthesia, Andy’s first words to friends were: “hassle...hassle mabaril bro” (“it’s such a hassle to be shot bro” in Tagalog). This traumatic event did not take away his courage, dampen his hope, or diminish his strength. Instead of being angry or bitter, Andy has stayed positive and is 100% focused on recovery. He is stable but doctors are not optimistic that he will ever recover use of his legs. His first step towards recovery is moving to a physical rehabilitation center in northern California.While he still does not have any feeling from the waist down, Andy has remained extraordinarily positive. A doctor told him that there was a 90% chance that he was paralyzed -- Andy’s response? “10% is more than I need.” We are (cautiously) hopeful that Andy will be able to walk again and want to help raise the funds needed to get him there.Neurosurgeons have commented that given Andy’s young age, health, positive attitude, and strong support system, he can make meaningful progress and potentially regain mobility during physical rehabilitation. This may take months, or even years, but Andy is completely determined to get back on his feet.More details on Andy’s time at the hospital to-dateAfter his first surgery the night of the shooting, Andy had a second successful operation on Wednesday, March 27. Doctors put screws and rods in his spine to help with reinforcement and stability. He has recovered extraordinarily quickly from these two procedures and was released from the ICU on April 1. Recommended treatmentDoctors have decided that it is safer to leave the bullet lodged in his chest wall (close to the lungs). As a result, they are unable to take an MRI or give a more accurate assessment of spinal damage. Instead of additional surgeries, doctors have recommended that Andy undergo rigorous physical rehabilitation at a leading facility that specializes in traumatic brain and spine injuries in young adults. Physical rehabilitation is the best next step to help Andy recover, become self-sufficient, and hopefully regain mobility.Where your money will goOur goal is to raise $100,000 to help Andy with the following:-- Physical rehabilitation costs that are not covered by insurance. His first round of rigorous physical therapy is estimated at $11k/day for 3 weeks. This will mostly be covered by insurance, but then Andy is expected to spend at least 3-4 sessions per week at another facility (each session estimated at $250/day, for at least 6 months)-- Home care costs (estimated at $100/day, for at least 6 months)-- Special needs due to his new disabilities (e.g., wheelchair, accessibility adjustments to his home)-- Living expenses / loss of income-- Any other out-of-pocket expenses that he may incur during rehabMore background on AndyAndy is a beloved son, brother, friend, and colleague -- the 20+ visitors per day in the ICU are a testament to that. Given everything that’s happened to him, it would have been completely understandable for Andy to be bitter or angry -- instead, he has spent his days in the ICU becoming friends with staff, entertaining visitors, and looking forward to regaining his strength and mobility.Thank you for reading Andy’s story.

We are concerned parents who is desperately seeking guidance and financial assistance that will allow our daughter to receive adequate medical attention/care who through no fault no fault of her own was struck head on by another vehicle traveling the wrong way while she was on her way home from work and she has unfortunately been in a coma for the past nine long months. It pains me to discuss this nightmare, however the need to obtain adequate medical care for our daughter supersedes the torment, agony and sense of helplessness my family is and has experienced since the accident.On April 28, 2020 at approximately 10:30 PM, my daughter was traveling home from work where she was a Phlebotomist at a hospital in New York. She was struck by a wrong way driver going southbound in the northbound lane on the Saw Mill River Parkway. Her car was not only struck head on, she was also struck from the car behind. Her car burst into flames and unfortunately her airbags failed to deploy. Needless to say, our lives have not been close to the same since that dreadful day. Shaniqwa was rushed to Westchester Medical Center in critical condition and was placed on life support and put in a medically induced coma for two months. We were told at that point that she was very lucky to be alive and it was touch and go due to the severity of injuries. She was the only one injured in the crash out of the four individuals involved, but thank God she was alive.Her injuries were and are extensive. They included multiple broken bones and a bleeding lever to name just a few. Shaniqwa is a fighter and we are a praying family. She sustained and is still suffering from a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). She stayed at Westchester Medical Center for three months and was then transferred to an acute long-term rehabilitation facility on July 21, 2020, once she was stable enough. We are heartbroken because we thought we saw a dim light at the end of this nightmare when she was moved to the rehabilitation facility. We were told in the beginning that they specialized in TBI care. However we weren't told the most important part, which is the patient needed to be able to follow commands.The months, weeks, days, and hours have been extremely tough on her as well as her entire family and this occurring during a pandemic (COVID-19) has complicated things even more. We remain prayerful and dedicated to the mission of getting our Shaniqwa on the other side of this tragedy.Since transferring to the rehabilitation facility, Shaniqwa has never been re-evaluated and has continued to receive the same medication regiment that she was prescribed during her hospital stay. Some of those medications were administered to keep her asleep. She is also being given medication used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disease and depression. We also learned that five months later that the facility was still administering strong psychotic and pain meds 2-3 times a day without re-evaluation of any kind. How do they expect her to wake up and recognize verbal commands if two of her medications are designed to make her sleep? Has any damage occurred due to the prolonged use of these medications?We have not been able to touch or talk to Shaniqwa since she arrived there on July 21, 2020 and as you can see we desperately need help navigating through this rough journey. We need help with getting Shaniqwa to a facility that has experience working with patients who have suffered TBI's that are nonverbal. Shaniqwa is still in a semi-coma and unable to follow commands. She also still has a tracheotomy and a feeding tube. We feel that she would be further along in the recovery process if she/we had the financial means or better medical insurance.In my desire to paint a clear picture, I'd also like to share the fact that she was wearing braces on her hands and feet when she transferred to the rehab facility in order to prevent her limbs from contracting. I was saddened to find out that one of her fingers have contracted and is now deformed with no plain in sight to repair it. She has also not been seen by a Neurologist therefore we have no idea if she still has fluid on the brain or has it made any progress, etc. We were told that outside physicians (neurologist) were not allowed to visit the facility due to COVID-19.Our daughter had just started a new job and was still within her probationary period, thus her medical insurance had not yet kicked in. This is a major dilemma and unfortunately presents an obstacle in the way of our beautiful, bright and caring daughter's path to receiving proper medial assistance. She is a fighter as you can see and she just needs your help. It was not her time on that day back in April and it certainly is not her time now, she still has work to do.My apologies for the length of this letter, but I wanted to paint a clear picture of what happened and the fact that we need help navigating through this to get Shaniqwa the medical attention that she desperately needs as soon as possible. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thanking you in advance for your time and attention regarding this matter.The DickersonsRead more"

7 year-old Jayshawn was diagnosed with a rare form of autoimmune encephalitis (Secondary to Neuronal Ganglionic Acetylcholine Receptor Antibodies) on June 11. He went to pediatric inpatient for what was expected to be 5 days of immunotherapy that turned into a 12 day hospital stay. At the worst moments he lost the ability to eat, speak and walk but has had a partial recovery with IViG and regained those abilities.Jayshawn is now in a pediatric rehab for acquired brain injuries and his mom has been with him unable to come home for more than a brief visit due to the complexity of his care.The family needs help paying for babysitting for the other 3 kids at home during this crucial time. Their grandma has taken FMLA to help over the past few weeks but must return to work soon and it’s unclear when Jayshawn will be able to come home.Any and all support is deeply appreciated!EDIT 11/30/2019We’re almost 6 months post diagnosis and noone knows why he’s had such a cyclical course of illness, improving so rapidly and worsening not long after. It’s hard to grieve or accept what is an ambiguous loss where we don’t know what tomorowill bring.

At this point, it seems like this will be a chronic condition we’ll have to learn to live with rather than beat in the way I had initially imagined. He can’t stay on Peds Neuro inpatient for long, he’s maxed out on inpatient rehab, he can attend Blythedale Day Hospital again as a transition, but we have to find a way to replicate a low stimulation structured environment to keep him home.There just isn’t this preexisting program that can help.He’s considered to medically needy for therapeutic placements and too therapeutically needy formedical placements so we have to make a way for him to thrive at home.

Our biggest need right now is for an aide to supplement the 24/7 supervision he needs to stay safe and in home therapists to keep him working on neurocognitive goals. They told us it takes 18-24 months to recover, so I’m trying to build the supports it will take to get there.

Jayshawn has spent most of these last 5.5 months in the hospital, last month for cognitive decline that evolved into acute agitation again. Monthly pulses of high dose steroids give him a few days of relief, where he seems like the little boy he was before all of this happened. But days pass and it feels like we’re back to where we started.

He’s still been getting monthly IViG, checking hisB Cell counts to see if he can receive another round of Rituximab before the 6 month mark and we are still debating if third line treatments like Cytoxan or CellCept have benefits that outweigh the risks.

After numerous appointments with his pediatrician and several X-Rays, it was determined that constipation was the driving factor behind the issues. More recently, Neena (Mom), and Tony (Dad) became concerned when Navon began to stumble and fall, seemingly for no reason. Fast forward to Christmas Eve - Navon woke up unable to walk or move his legs at all. Neena and Tony rushed him to Children's Hospital in St. Paul, MN where he was immediately put under anesthesia and put through a 2 hour MRI and spinal tap.The MRI showed an Arachnoid Cyst that had been growing on the front side of his spinal cord. The on-call pediatric surgeon was called in and they performed emergency surgery that evening to drain the cyst. Surgery went well but as of today he still has no function in his legs.Navon was transferred to Gillette Children's Hospital in St. Paul on January 7th for a 6 week in-patient rehabilitation program. Because of Navon's demanding recovery and rehab schedule, and caring for their youngest daughter, Nyomi (1.5), Neena and Tony have both taken a 12 week, non-paid leave from work (FMLA). As you can imagine, medical bills, groceries, gas, rent and everyday expenses have become difficult to manage. Furthermore, Tony and Neena will likely need to uproot their family and move to a home to better suit Navon's possible new lifestyle should he not regain the ability to walk on his own.Neena and Tony humbly ask for your prayers and support during this difficult time.

I lost my job due to COVID and had to move back home to Chicago. I started my move in March of 2020 and had to make a second trip back to get the rest of my things. A day after I arrived in Orlando I got a call my mother fell in the bathroom and hit her hip and could not walk. I hired a care giver and paid her to help with my mother while I made the second trip back to Chicago. It took about a month and my mom made a full recovery and was able to walk and cook etec.I thought we were out of the woods but no such luck. About a month later on July 10 2020 my mother suffered a massive left sided stroke which she had right in-front of me. I called 911 as soon as I saw her symptoms and she was rushed to MacNeil Hospital about 10 min away from us. Five and a half hours later she was rushed to Loyola Hospital for emergency surgery to remove the clot from her artery in her neck that was blocking of essential blood and oxygen to her brain. This was caused by an irregular heart beat that we didn't know about.The neurosurgeon managed to get the clot out. My mother was in ICU for 1 week and 4 weeks in a room recovering. They told me she would likely be in a wheelchair for rest of her life and lose her independence. Her right arm and leg were left immobile and she could not talk or swallow. They doctors asked me if I wanted to pull the plug or put a feeding tube in. It was an absolute nightmare as I am the only family of immigrant parents.She has been at a Nursing home rehab for 1 month now and 2 months since the stroke. My mother is making great progress thus far. She is moving her left side, has begun eating pure foods, and has a little movement in her right hip. My hope is that she will continue to progress and exceed expectations and prove everyone wrong.The nursing home is trying to push Medicade on me which we will lose our home if she gets on this program. They have tried to be shady with their tactics and methods in getting their way. They will not return emails to me so there is no paper trail. They tried to auto populate my signature in their 130 page contract given to me. I did not sign. They are evasive with information etec. I would move her to a different nursing home but my options are very limited due to her insurance and the other options for nursing homes are worse.My mothers insurance only pays for 30 min of physical therapy per discipline per day which is not enough for her to get better. I cannot see her due to COVID rules and cannot oversee her care as they won't let me in the building. I'm being jerked around when I ask for progress reports and so on. She has approx 2 months left there before they send her home but her insurance can cut her off at any time if they feel she is not making progress. After her insurance cuts her off to pay cash for 1 month at the nursing home is 8,000.00. Physical Therapy is separate and charges 150.00 1 hour so that's an additional 10,000.00 for a total of 18,000.00 a month.These first 6 months of therapy are crucial as my mothers brain is trying to rewire itself. The only way my mother will get better and defeat all odds is with an intense rehab program that I'd like to do at home. I'd like to hire a rehab company to come in and give my mother the therapy she needs.As a concerned son and only family she has here in the states I am asking infact begging for any help I can get for my mother.

Symptoms generally appear 1 to 3 days after surgery and can persist from months to years.Thankfully Aditas parents have insurance that is covering most of the medical costs, but they are incurring extraordinary expenses that they just cannot afford.

Adita is cutlery at Boston Children's Hospital and hopefully she will be moved to the Spaulding Rehab Center to start therapy. The road is long and they need out help. I am putting in $1,000 to start the fund and ask that you help out in anyway possible. I have never done this before, so hopefully it goes well.  I can provide additional information to anybody that is interested or needs to verify anything. Thank you and God bless. Jesus E Beltran Jr El Paso TXRead more"

He was released Sept. 4 and went home to recover. He did not recover and progressively got worse. Finally, after much persistence, his primary care doctor referred him back to an Infectious Disease doctor, who immediately readmitted Jim into the hospital on Sept. 29 for more tests. Three weeks and several spinal taps, MRIs, CT scans and even a brain biopsy still did not reveal the underlying cause of Jim’s severe spinal and brain lining swelling. He is currently in rehab, and has a long road to recovery ahead of him.So, lots of people get sick, why start a GoFundMe page?To compound matters, Jim lost his job at the end of last year, and was actively doing handyman work and beginning an exciting new journey as a sales rep. He has been out of work for 9 weeks and counting, which is the impetus for this page. How will my donation be helpful?This has been very stressful on the family. Michelle works full time and Sarah is in school and works 20 hours a week. Between daily trips to the hospital and work schedules, the family is stretched thin. Rather than meals (dietary and work schedules makes this difficult!), the Dressen family is reaching out for funds they can use for gas, uber, food, mounting medical bills and future co-pays while they support Jim in his recovery. He will require many follow-up doctor visits and out-patient rehab upon his release. Funds raised on this page would allow Jim to focus on a full recovery, not on how to pay expenses.Thank you!This was not an easy decision for the family to agree to ask for help and every donation is humbly appreciated and received with a heartfelt thank you.Read more"

I am a 23-year-old graduate from the University of Maryland College Park. I studied business finance and now I am a budding financial advisor and business consultant, working to help any and everyone achieve financial freedom through consultation and hands-onadvice. Unfortunately, my career is being put on hold because of a recurring issue. In August of 2014, I developed something called a cavernous malformation on my Brain stem which caused me to lose control of my right side motor functions, develop slurred speech, and difficulty swallowing. The mass was discovered and subsequently removed for the most part. I returned to the university about two weeks after recovery, and as any 20 year old would do, I returned to my normal life but my body hadn't been given proper time to heal. I was president of the campus chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha, taking a full load, and pursuing opportunities outside the classroom. Due to my incessantwork ethic, I was not able to slow down and I suffered a stroke on September 18, 2014. I was rushed to the ER and spent a month at MedStar National Rehabilitation center in inpatient physical, occupational, and speech therapy. I was released on October 17, 2014, and spent the remainder of the year in outpatient therapy. I turned 21 on December 25, 2014. Following the stint in rehab, I returned to the University and completed a successful spring 2015 semester. Throughout the year I would continue to check in with my neurosurgeon and have MRI's to monitor the status of the malformation. Unfortunately, about September, it was discovered that the mass had regrown and was much more aggressive this time so we slatted a second surgery for October1st, 2015. The surgery was successful in getting a lot of the mass material out of that small area of ""high-priced real estate"", and the doctors were happy. The scan did still show something there but not enough to raise alarm. Post surgery recovery wasroughand took the rest of 2015 to do so. Constant checkups and MRI's were used to monitor the status. The whole year of 2016 and the first half of 2017 went swimmingly. I returned to physical activity, became independent, andbest of all I graduated from Robert H. School of Business and started my career two days later. All seemed to be goingaccording to plan until it wasn't. Starting on September 9, 2017, I began having constantheadaches accompanied with waves of full body weakness and dizziness. By Thursday, September 14, 2017, I had decided to see my primary care doctor but she was out sick so I went to the ER. The CT and MRI scan showed that I had suffered another hemorrhagein the same area. The neurosurgery team thought it would be best stave off surgery, for now, so I was monitored for two days and sent home. The next day the Headaches got worse, and some new symptoms set in. The left side of my face is numb and nonresponsive, I cannot taste on the left side of my mouth, and the deficits on my right side are returning as I type. I woke up the next morning with double vision and nausea so It was back to the ER. It was discovered that yet another hemorrhage had taken place in the same area. The doctors had done two approaches already and the risks we high for a third entry so we were referred to a skull based specialist at Rutgers University hospital. All of my previous work had been done at George Washington University Hospital. The doctor is highly qualified and is very confident that he can fix the problem in my brain. The only issue is that his practice does not take my insurance, and thus we would have to pay out of pocket for this procedure. The date is set for October 12, 2017, so time is of the essence. The deficits are getting progressively worse and I need this procedure finally do away with something that has plagued my life for the last 3 years. Please donate what you can or even provide me with names of qualified neurosurgeons. My family and I need help, and if you are reading this I hope you can find it within you to do so.Read more"

In July of 2016 our mother Marilyn Nicholson was diagnosed with a cancer in her left lung, she underwent chemotherapy and radiation for 3 months I took her to every appointment and every day she took treats to the staff. When she finished her treatments just before Christmas she brought a huge special made cake big enough for everyone to say ""Thank You"". On Jan 30th 2017, just weeks ago, we heard the worst words any child can hear- our mom, who is only 73 years old, was diagnosed with a two brain metastasis tumors. She had surgery on February 02, 2017 on the larger of the two. The swelling was so much that the midline of her brain had shifted affecting her speech and some of her cognitive skills. This is so heartbreaking for us; Mom is the most caring, giving, loving person we know. She always baking cakes, brownies, or cookies for everyone. If someone had a birthday, or anniversary or just a special event she was right there with the goodies to help celebrate. Even when she went to the doctors she would bring the doc treats. Mom who everyone has known for 20 plus years as ""Miss Mal"", only just retired as a waitress 9 months ago after 20 years with Waffle House and was hoping to spend some happy time with her kids, grandkids, and her dog Rocky when all this started. Unfortunately her then doctor did not tell us much of anything about her lung cancer, and as much as we thought we knew, we didn’t know enough to ask more questions, when we finished her treatments we thought ""Yea, all done"" and were supposed to go back in 6 weeks for a scan to see how she responded. Before those 6 weeks were up she ended up in the hospital because of she was not herself and was forgetting simple things, it was discovered that the cancer had spread to her brain. No one, not her Oncologist, not the Radiologist, not the Pulmonologist told any of us-ESPECIALLY her, about the possibility of cancer going to the brain or even how common it happens. We knew NOTHING, when I confronted the Doctor for not telling us more and not warning us what to watch for I was told I should have done research myself. I started bawling, I don't live with my parents, that doctor and her Radiologist saw me every day when I took our mom for treatments and NEVER said anything to me about what to watch out for. I was devastated. Last week we finally brought her home and the following evening she had a seizure and is now back in the hospital. We are not giving up, I watched my mom as she cried and told the Doctors that she didn't want to die. It was so freaking heart wrenching that I nearly had a meltdown right then and there. My parents are hardworking everyday people just trying to enjoy life and family, my dad is 74 years old and still works full time even though he's very ill with gout and arthritis, but he has to work to keep their medical coverage. They don't have a lot for how hard they have worked and we just found out that there is no Life Insurance for her and so many doctor bills that aren't covered. We would like to put her in a skilled Nursing facility with rehab but our dad’s medical insurance will not cover room and board. We need to get her out of the hospital as they have just written her off and are waiting for her to die. We try to be with her 24/7 but I still have kids at home and my brother has a job he has to keep, our other three siblings live way up north. The last three times one of us has been to the hospital at meal times we have found her covered in food and eating with her fingers because she's too weak to use regular silverware. So we begging on behalf of the wonderful woman everyone knows and loves so very very much and calls ""Miss Mal"" for help in getting her into a skilled nursing facility. Won't you please help us and donate. Thanking everyone in advance for your support on behalf of ""Miss Mal""Read more"

Luis Memorial Hospital on St Croix. She went in with a fever, feeling lethargic. Within a short time, she was diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs and they expected her to need to stay in the hospital for two days. What they expected to be a short trip to the hospital quickly took an unexpected turn. Erin had to be resuscitated multiple times as her lungs failed her. She was moved to the ICU early in the morning on August 21st and stabilized before getting on a medical flight to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, FL. Erin was moved to Jackson Memorial to take advantage of the ECMO machine which allows her to get oxygen without the use of her lungs while also receiving dialysis support for her kidneys. Since arriving in Miami on Thursday evening Erin has undergone surgery on her legs to relieve pressure from blood clots. Erin will undergo an additional surgery in the next 24 to 48 hours to support her heart function. This surgery will involve the amputation of her right leg just above the knee. The doctors are assessing whether she will need to lose her left foot.As you can see, Erin’s road to recovery will be long, but a path is developing that will help her get there. She is fighting hard for her life every minute of every hour with blood literally leaving her body to be oxygenated before returning to sustain her. Her organs are on the mend, but they are still not operating properly. Even after her lungs and kidneys have healed, she will need months of physical therapy to help her return to normal life.Erin will be in the hospital for at least another couple of months. This will require short term housing for Packy and her mother, Colleen, as well as transportation while they are there. Lastly, Packy is a local business owner on St Croix and will need to travel to the island to run the business and more importantly to see their children: Fiona, Hazel and Patch.Important: Packy wants to ensure that everyone knows Erin would not be here without the support and love of the Nurses, Doctors and staff at JFL Hospital in St Croix. The people there truly worked miracles and with their hands and minds but are hamstrung by the lack of resources at the hospital. Any extra funds not used for housing, flights or transportation will go directly to JFL and we will work hard to ensure they get earmarked for something the staff specifically say they need.Packy and his family appreciate all of the love and support that they have and continue to receive from their friends, family and the community.Read more"

Our friendship started on the soccer fields watching our children play together and has continued to grow to the point that both families are very close, sharing birthdays, thanksgivings, beach trips, etc. On behalf of this beautiful family, I have organized this campaign to help them with what we can in this tragedy. 100% of donations will go to Mafer and Ramón, for Matías' recovery. Below a note from the Gil-Pozo family.We are Mafer and Ramón, parents of Matías (13) and Camilo (10). Five years ago, we changed our residence from our beloved native Venezuela due to the need to recover our security and quality of life. This brought us to Austin, Texas. It has not been easy, but it has been very stimulating, especially for our children. We have found the support in this transition of life in their schools, neighbors, in their soccer club (Lonestar Soccer Club), and Camilo’s piano lessons with Mrs. Elise.On June 16th life gave us a new test and the most difficult one. A month after being hit by a car while riding his bike, Matías had surgery for what was supposed to be a relatively simple outpatient procedure for a knee injury from the accident. However, he had an unexpected and inexplicable reaction to the anesthesia, which caused several lesions in his brain, specifically in the basal ganglia and cerebellum (the areas that control motor movement and coordination). This affected his ability to control his arms, legs, and jaw.Everyone knows Matías as a cheerful and very social kid, a competitive athlete, an outstanding student, and the love of our lives. However, due to the brain lesions, Matías could not speak (apraxia), walk, eat/swallow, or return home to play with his brother. All his motor functions were seriously affected, as well as his life and ours. All this happened just when he got promoted with his team to the Premier Soccer League (Texas). This was another step towards achieving his dream to play at the highest level.Matías went 3 times to the ER at St. David's Hospital and after about 3 weeks in agony, he was hospitalized for almost two months at Dell Children’s Hospital. Multiple specialists and therapists are now beginning to stabilize his painful cramps, contractions, tremors, stiff/tight muscles (spasticity), and involuntary movements (dystonia). Thanks to the intensive rehab program (physical, occupational, speech, and music therapies), and numerous medications (among them morphine and Valium), Matías has shown surprising signs of recovery. The doctors also continue to research and perform various tests to figure out the cause and diagnose his ""rare reaction."" We have reasons to be optimistic, but it is a hard and long battle.Matías is now eating some small portions of solids; he is slowly moving his arms and legs; he smiles and his eyes shine like suns, and he whispered his first words: “Mom, I love you”, softly for my soul to hear it.Matías is rarely discouraged; he knows that he cannot miss a day of work and that his extraordinary effort is the only way to his recovery. Each of his small achievements brings tears of joy to our eyes, which only exude hope, love, and trust in this unknown and long road in which we need you along the way. Now we are starting to realize how much help we will need to go successfully through this.We give thanks to life for every progress, no matter how small. We dream of seeing him again on the soccer field with his successful team, doing tricks on his bike, and riding together as a family. Thanks Mati for being our teacher. Thanks to our whole family and friends, who help and support us.Thanks to each one of you who is reading this. Perhaps you can support us and collaborate with this GoFundMe campaign to allow us to gather all the possible resources that we need. While the insurance has covered a portion, this will be a long process with significant medical and therapeutic expenses, equipment, home modifications, special diet, and rehabilitation, among others.Thank you with all our hearts,Mafer, Ramon, Matías, and Camilo.(Pictures following Spanish version)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Soy Sally Bardwell, una gran amiga de la familia Gil-Pozo. Nuestra amistad empezó en las canchas de fútbol viendo a nuestros hijos jugar juntos y ha seguido creciendo al punto que ambas familias son muy unidas, compartiendo cumpleaños, acciones de gracias, paseos a la playa, etc. En nombre de esta hermosa familia he organizado esta campaña para ayudarlos con lo que podamos en esta tragedia. El 100% de las donaciones irán a Mafer y Ramón, para la recuperación de Matías. A continuación, una nota de parte de la familia Gil-Pozo.Somos Mafer y Ramón, padres de Matías (13) y Camilo (10). Hace cinco años nos mudamos de nuestra querida Venezuela a Austin, Texas por la necesidad de recuperar la seguridad y calidad de vida para nuestra familia. No ha sido fácil, pero sí muy estimulante, sobre todo para nuestros hijos. Quienes han encontrado, en su escuela, vecinos, en su club de futbol (Lonestar Soccer Club) y en las clases de piano de Camilo con Mrs. Elise, el soporte en esta transición de vida.El pasado 16 de junio la vida nos puso una nueva prueba, la más difícil: tras un mes del arrollamiento mientras montaba bicicleta, Matías entró al quirófano a una operación relativamente simple y ambulatoria para corregir la lesión en su rodilla debido al accidente. Sin embargo, una inesperada e inexplicable reacción a la anestesia le ha ocasionado varias lesiones en el cerebro, específicamente en el ganglios basales y cerebelo (las áreas que actúan como el centro de control y coordinación de movimientos). Esto afectó su capacidad de controlar sus extremidades, legua y mandíbula.Matías es conocido por todos como un niño alegre y muy social, deportista competitivo, destacado en sus estudios y amor de nuestras vidas. Sin embargo, debido a la lesión cerebral, no pudo hablar (apraxia), comer/tragar, caminar, o volver a casa a jugar con su hermano. Todas sus funciones motoras se vieron seriamente afectadas, así como su vida y la nuestra. Todo esto ocurre justo cuando acabada de ser promovido junto a su equipo a la Liga Premier de Futbol (Texas), lo que era un paso más en la realización de su sueño: jugar al más alto nivel.Matías tuvo 3 visitas a la emergencia del St. David’s Hospital y finalmente luego de cerca de 3 semanas de mucha agonía fue hospitalizado por casi dos meses en Dell Children's Hospital. Los diferentes especialistas, médicos y terapeutas están empezando a estabilizar los dolorosos calambres, temblores, movimientos involuntarios (distonía), rigides musculares (espasticidad) y vómitos que sufría. Gracias al intenso programa de terapias (terapias físicas, ocupacionales, del habla y de música) y numerosos medicamentos (entre ellos morfina y Valium), Matías ha dado muestras sorprendentes de recuperación. Los doctores continúan investigando y realizando diversos exámenes para encontrar la causa y diagnosticar su “rara reacción”. Somos optimistas, pero será una larga y dura batalla.Después de esta larga cuarentena, hospitalizado y muy bien atendido, Mati comenzó a comer algunas pequeñas porciones de sólidos, poco a poco va moviendo sus extremidades, sonríe y le brillan sus ojos como soles y ¡susurra sus primeras palabras!: “Mamá, te amo”, bajito para que mi alma lo escuche mejor.Matías casi nunca se desanima, sabe que no puede perder ni un día de trabajo, y que su extraordinario esfuerzo es el único camino hacia su recuperación. Cada uno de sus pequeños logros hacen brotar lágrimas de alegría de nuestros poros, que sólo transpiran esperanza, amor y confianza en este proceso desconocido y largo en el que necesitamos acompañamiento.Damos gracias a la vida por cada progreso, por pequeño que sea, y soñamos viéndolo de nuevo en el campo de futbol junto a su exitoso equipo y haciendo trucos en su bici. Gracias Mati, por ser nuestro maestro. Gracias a toda la familia y amigos, que nos acompaña y apoya.Gracias a cada uno de ustedes que nos está leyendo y quizás pueda apoyarnos y colaborar con esta campaña del GoFundMe que nos permitirá reunir todo el dinero posible que tanto necesitamos. Aun cuando el seguro ha cubierto una parte de los gastos, esto va a ser un largo proceso para hacer frente a importantes gastos médicos y terapéuticos para los tratamientos, equipos, modificaciones en el hogar, dieta especial y rehabilitaciones entre otros.

August 10th, 2017 she was in a motorcycle accident with her boyfriend Sam in Weymouth, Massachusetts. Unfortunately, Sam did not survive this accident and Sara was seriously injured. We will forever miss Sam and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family. That day, Sam was Sara's angel and because of that, she's alive but with 57% burns throughout her body. Many people have reached out to our family wanting to help her mom Becky, younger sisters Maryemma and Ella and the rest of our family in any way they could. Sara will be in the hospital for awhile and will need rehab. She will need multiple surgeries to repair the burns throughout her body. Sara is very deserving, she's an amazing and smart person with a very bright future ahead of her. Any room she walked into she could light it up. She has a big family and so many friends that all love her very much. In high school she played softball and also got an academic scholarship to Salem State University. The hospital bills, medications and rehabilitation will be extremely expensive. Sara has a tough road ahead of her. As a community this is where we can help raise money for Sara and her family. And in order to help bring down the stress for them, we are asking for your support. Any kind of donation or words of encouragement are greatly appreciated.

Sam does not live in the US or have an American bank account, but her mother Denise does. This is so she will able to access GoFundMe's funds and make sure the money donated goes directly to her daughter's medical needs.**What happenedOn the 26th of October, Sam Panda was performing an aerial show at Finn’s Beach Club in Canggu, Bali when the rig she was hanging from snapped and she plummeted 13 feet onto her head, breaking her neck in several places.She somehow survived but has multiple fractures and a shard of bone stuck in her spinal cord which is preventing her from walking.Why we need the moneyNumerous doctors haveurgedSam to haveher surgery in Singapore or Taiwan with specialist surgeons who are experienced enough to deal with this complex case.Sam had a work permit and was told that she was fully insured by heremployers. Unfortunately, her employer’s insurance won’t pay for the medical evacuation she needs to get the surgery that will help her walk again. Her livelihood depends on her physical wellbeing which is currently severely compromised. Doctors have also stated that time is of the essence - the longer Sam stays inBali, the higher the risk that these debilitating injuries are irreversible.How much we needSOS have given us a quotation of $40,000 to get Sam safely out of Bali. That will cover all the costs for a medical evacuation out of Bali and into the hands of a surgeon who can fix her neck and spinal cord.Once she arrives home her insurance will cover the costs of her surgery and rehabilitation.
We just need your help to pay for the plane to get her there.Pleasedonate anything you can to help Sam. This girl is not only talented but so big-hearted.***UPDATE***Hi everyone! So sorry for the delays in updating everyone. It's been a crazy few days of massive surgery and recovery, but we are now 4 days post op and doing absolutely amazingly. The surgery was incredibly intense, and required a 36 hour traction period (being bolted down to the bed using screws in the skull), and none of the damaged pieces of bone were able to be saved. We had to get a titanium vertabrae and 2 artificial discs ordered and brand new from Germany. So now Sam is pretty much Iron Man and well on the way to recovery. The good news is that because of this, the actual healing part is much easier because everything that would have had to heal now is simply just new. This cuts down recovery time by a lot! Unfortunately this damage replacement costs a lot more than reconstruction, because of having to buy top-grade German engineered products. We want to give you a breakdown of what your donations have been used for so far:Medevac airplane out of Bali and to Taiwan (including all doctors, seats, medicine, ambulances, liaisons, visas, hotel stays, tickets, etc.): $38,000 USDSurgery and hospital stay in Taiwan up to Nov 12 (including surgery, room stay, titanium and artificial disc implants, medicine, doctor fees, etc.): $23,511 USD We are still working on rehab costs which haven't been estimated yet, as well as the final hospital bill, depending on when Sam is finally discharged and can go home. Although she is able to walk with support (amazing!!) she has been suffering from vertigo, related to inner ear damage from the impact, and can't stand on her own just yet. Rehab will likely take some more hard work on Sam's part.We want to take the time to say the biggest thank you possible to Dr. Alex Lu and his team at Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taipei. They are more than doctors, but miracle workers for taking such a serious and dangerous surgery on and pulling it off so beautifully and successfully. We learned how close Sam was to paralysis, and they not only took her back from that edge, but will bring her back to being her old self as well. They are our heroes.As always, thank you for all of your love and support. Your donations have been massively useful and have gone an incredible way to make sure that she was able to be saved. None of this would have been possible without the support and kindness that came in floods from all over the world. You are all our heroes too! <3 We cannot thank you enough, and we will continue to update as frequently as possible.***UPDATE 28.11.2017To everyone who has helped me out through this rough time, I just want to say a tremendous thank you. I have been recovering very well, and I am slowly but surely getting myself back to a normal life. I absolutely would not have survived without any of you, so please know how much I care and love each of you for your donations. Every single little bit helped me go from barely surviving to being able to make a full recovery (in time. Still moving slowly. No one panic). We have reached enough money to cover all of the bills that I needed to, so I am going to shut down the donations. I appreciate everything you've done for me, and I don't want to just continue to take money from you, so I will end this here and let you know that all of your donations went directly towards my medical bills and my recovery. I also want to update you and let you know that I saw my hero (my doctor, Dr. Alex Lu) yesterday, and he was really happy with the progress I've been making with my rehab and he confirmed that all of the split work I have been doing is perfectly fine, so also anyone worrying about me doesn't have to do so any more (though I do appreciate it. You guys are so lovely). Thank you again, and I love you from the bottom of my heart. You saved my life, and I can never repay you for that. Best wishes to all of you, and I know good things are coming your way because of your love and kindness. -Sam PandaRead more"

After a fruitless trip to the ER, he spent the next month enduring symptoms of fatigue, headache, confusion, and fogginess until he returned to the ER where a large tumor was found on his frontal lobe. He immediately underwent surgery, and after a lengthy pathology analysis was diagnosed with a meningeal sarcoma, an extremely aggressive and rare cancer-- so rare, in fact, that the oncologists in his hometown of Lynchburg had never encountered one-- and was immediately referred to experts at Duke University.There he underwent several months of radiation, commuting from Lynchburg to Durham on a weekly basis through July. The few months following his radiation were relatively calm. His scans showed no evidence of tumor, and he returned to life with few side-effects and hopes that the worst was behind him.Late November 2017, Michael began showing subtle changes, a slight drooping in one eye, losing a word here and there. Thanksgiving day aroused his family's fears as he drifted in and out of sleep during conversation. They restlessly endured the week between the holiday and his scheduled three month scan where the doctors would find yet another mass at the resection area. One of Duke's best neurosurgeons performed Michael's second surgery in mid December. Despite the doctors' suspicions, the growth resected this time was found to be benign, dead tissue from the radiation. Yet again, Michael recovered quickly and spent the next few months trying to live as normally as possible until a lump began to protrude from his forehead. In March 2018, a biopsy brought fears to fruition once again as the tumor had returned and begun to come through his skull.After one more unsuccessful trial with a non-chemo IV treatment, oncologists finally prescribed chemotherapy. In the midst of treatment, however, Michael began to have seizures, which took about a week in the hospital to contain. Then only about a week after his discharge, he was hospitalized again for a staph infection in his chemo port.Up until this point, Michael has functioned remarkably. With the help of family, friends, and employers, he has worked, maintained his energy, met his responsibilities, and kept an admirable sense of hope. While he retains hope, Michael's cognition and basic abilities have been severely reduced by the seizure medication and the effect of the cancer on his brain. He has been in the hospital for the last two weeks with hope of transferring to in-patient rehab, but he since has had his first seizure in two months, and they've discovered the cancer spreading to the lining of his brain and brain stem. He started a new treatment this week, and we're reaching out to any and all experts for input. I still believe that his will and spirit are strong but are being suppressed by the medication and circumstances.My name is Lindsay, and I'm writing as Michael's fiancé, advocate, and caregiver. By divine provisions and the generosity of others, we've kept afloat until this point, but on his, mine, and his family's behalf, I must ask for help. In addition to Michael's fight, his father is also battling cancer, leaving energy and resources from his family very strained. Michael's future is so unsure, but his obligations, medical expenses, care expenses, student loans, etc. remain. Also, if the potential arises to be transferred to Johns Hopkins, funds would be needed for travel and subsistence while I or his family may be out of work to travel with him. If the option arises, that may also mean greater out-of-pocket expenses with insurance, and our need would become more immediate.I wish that everyone reading or thinking of giving could know the person Michael is. He has a reputation. He is good, kind, and giving to all people indiscriminately-- family, friends, strangers, and I would suspect enemies, though I've never known him to have one. Michael is not a talker (sometimes to a fault) but expresses his intentions by doing. He's a lover of God and man, and he needs no dogmas or isms to do so; it flows from his spirit. Some may even criticize his unquestioning giving, but he does so knowing he is only responsible for his willingness and not for the recipients' intentions. Michael works hard to meet his needs and is no stranger to struggle, but he will extend any resource he has to meet the needs of others. The night I took Michael to the ER where we discovered the tumor, I briefly stepped out to find food for both of us. As I pulled into the parking lot of the Subway by the hospital, a familiar woman approached me asking for money for something to eat. I had encountered this woman a number of times stopping people on the street for help. I recalled the first time I saw her one evening with Michael. Though skeptical of her story, Michael stopped by the ATM machine to retrieve a little bit of cash for the lady and then went out of his way to be sure she made it where she was going and insisted on walking her to the door, as she was feeble. I bought her some food that night, reflecting on how I had seen his goodness extended to her and how much my heart hurt that such a good man was suffering. One evening in July, he was particularly concerned about his grandparents as they were forced to move from independent living to assisted living. He sat sorting his work and chemo schedule in his mind to find a time to help them move. He remarked ""I don't want them to have to lift a finger."" That was the last day he was fully himself. He had his first seizure that night, leaving him with no memory of the week prior and sparking his decline up to this point.I know not everyone has the means to give, but a share can still reach someone who can. Know that everything received will be used in Michael's interest and care. To anyone with the time or the ability to give, share, and pray we hope your goodness is returned tenfold.Read more"

She had an appendectomy (appendix removal) and ran into issues with ventilation where Steph had a long period of critically low oxygen levels in her body. Due to unforeseen circumstances, Steph had an emergency c-section, got a tracheostomy, chest drain and central line inserted. She was put into an induced coma in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) where the doctors told us they were concerned she might not make it or have severe brain damage.Days later my mother was informed my sister-in-law’s appendix was not removed. The hospital was over an hour away from Steph and Cam’s home. Many family members (including interstate) travelled far distances and stayed in the area to be close to Steph and help support Cam as we were told it may be her final days.Fortunately Steph fought and came of the other end of the tunnel and got to hold her baby girl (see above image). The experience has left her with suspected PTSD, memory loss, body weakness and flashbacks. The pain suffered is not only physical for Steph but emotionally debilitating, especially on my brother Cam who is struggling financially to look after their four kids and his wife. Unfortunately what has happened has still left a burden on the family. My brother has almost ran out of his annual leave and is trying to get back to work, but at this point is struggling as he is at home to support Steph. We have been in contact with a lawyer who has claimed this will be a long case (around 3 years), which means unfortunately no financial assistance will be accommodated at this given point in time as it is a lengthy process. The lawyer has requested just over $500 to receive the medical records from the hospital. My brother has recently been given a bill for the emergency hospital accomodation and fell behind in expenses such as bills while he was away from home. Cam & Steph often travel to a centre over an hour away for Steph’s rehab. The money donated can help them pay off their debts and continue to take off some financial strain and will go towards: - Cam’s loss of income - Petrol, parking and costs associated with rehab and hospital visits - Back-paying accomodation and bills- Counselling fees- Medical record feesWe would like to thank everyone who has already contributed by helping care for the kids at the time, and helped with food and other expenses.

Three years later, we were broke. The majority of the money went to self-paid intake and therapy appointments at first; then transportation for him to therapist, labs, doctor appointments, hospital deposits and medical payments. It went to hired""sitters"" who checked in on him, or stayed with him, so I could work; it went to outrageously priced medications--upwards of 1300$ for a single monthly injection over 6 months; it went to court and legal fees, parking, cabs, hotels, flights, a supervised housing group home at 5500-6K per month for nearly a year; and to a girl hired to do only insurance paperwork --It turns out, I'm not alone by a long shot.Families of severely mentally ill children and young adults, like those with schizophrenia, go bankrupt more than any other families with chronically ill members. This is due to lack of insurability, self-pay requirements for psychiatry, lengthy inpatient stays, exorbitant medication costs, legal fees, and traveling to care. Most post-acute care for serious mental illness is not covered by insurance, so families cannot take advantage of Step-Down programs hospitals offer to bridge the gaps in care between hospital and home. For example, just one week of Step Down care at Johns Hopkins costs $20,000. Additionally, outpatient therapist appointments cost $150 to $250 an hour self-paid.

Due to trauma he couldn't have surgery until Feb 6th. He began recovery after surgery finally returning to light duty for 1 week at the end of March, but swelling continued resulting in doctors order of 3 more weeks bedrest. On April 11th he was referred to a plastic surgeon in Sioux Falls for a skin graph. In Sioux Falls they determined his leg was infected, resulting in admission to the hospital on April 16th, where he remains. He had 4 surgeries trying to save his leg but staph infection destroyed his foot/ankle joint, heel, and followed up the fracture line of his tibia. It was determined amputation was the best solution. On April 22 he underwent below the knee amputation and will remain in the hospital until pain is managed. Bruce has been unable to work during most of this ordeal and is out of time off but hoping to return to law enforcement in the future.

Ron was unresponsive when he was taken to Bronson Hospital and admitted to the Neuro ICU Unit. He was intubated, placed on a ventilator, and after four days was given a tracheostomy and feeding tube. Ron had a hematoma on both left and right sides of his brain, with contusions and bleeds throughout. Landing on his right side, he had a large gash on his forehead, a broken occipital bone (eye socket), wrist, two ribs, pelvis, L1 & L2 of his spine, and left mandible. After five days, surgery was performed on his wrist, stabilizing it with a plate. All other broken bones were non-separated and would heal on their own, given that he was immobile. Ron was in a coma. Due to COVID, I was only able to see him when he was admitted to the hospital, and then again before his wrist surgery.After a week Ron was transported to Ascension Borgess-Pipp in Plainwell, MI. This long term acute care (LTAC) facility allowed us to see and talk to Ron through a window for the first two weeks, although the doctor did allow us to sneak in a few times, once with Ron's dog, Buddy. On occasion friends joined us for support. Outside his window we hung a bird feeder and a beautiful geranium plant from neighbors Bill & Ginie. We decorated his window with a sign from one of his favorite songs, reading, “We Love You, So Much, So Much"", and signed his family and friends names. After about three weeks they began to wean Ron off the ventilator, and although he could only go a few minutes the first day, the rest of the time went smoothly and successfully. Ron was at Borgess-Pipp for 8-weeks and received the same incredible care that he got at Bronson. It became clear that he needed to be transferred out because the LTAC had done all they could; the remainder of his recovery was up to him. He needed to be transferred into a Skilled Nursing Care facility where he would receive rehab, but when Ron’s Case Manager contacted over 30 skilled care facilities, they either weren't taking patients because of COVID, or because they weren’t trained to deal with traches. These skilled care facilities were also not allowing visitors, and the idea of us not being able to participate in and monitor Ron’s care was absolutely heart wrenching. This was a very difficult time for Linda and me, as we were clear that Ron needed his family and friend’s love and encouragement to facilitate the kind of recovery required to move to a TBI Rehab facility. We made the decision to bring him home and transformed the den into a hospital room. Once that decision was made, a great relief came over us. On Friday, July 17th Ron was brought home by ambulance and has since been receiving around the clock care from us, with the help of a home health care agency. The gifts of having Ron at home are abundant. Ron is much more relaxed, and thriving, even though his gains are made in small increments. Occasionally, we’ll see a leap in some action that he takes, which is so exciting and promising. From being unresponsive and in a coma, where he didn't move any part of his body, to working with a physical therapist, speech therapist and occupational therapist each week, sitting on the edge of his bed daily, strengthening his core and holding his head up; it is amazing to witness. Ron is still not consistently following commands or tracking with his eyes; he’s not considered fully alert quite yet. As people recover from traumatic brain injury, they pass through many ability levels, and Ron still has a ways to go.  It’s been a rude awakening learning how little Medicare covers. Basically, less than 35 hours of skilled nursing care which is Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy and Speech combined. They don’t cover most medical supplies, although if he was in a nursing home, they would. It's the same with the 24 hour care that we currently have to pay for on our own. The costs for one-month of care at home for Ron is over $25,000. We don't know where his recovery is going, or how long it will take, but it really doesn’t matter. I’ll pay whatever it takes, for as long as I can, because everything I have means nothing without Ron.Linda and I, along with family, friends, and friends of friends have been on this incredible journey of fear and faith and love. Prayers and thoughts of care have filled our mailbox, phone messages, texts, emails and Facebook pages. We have no idea what to expect, but love prevails and asks only that we show up one day, and sometimes one moment at a time. Ron is an active man, a horse whisperer, a seeker, a devoted husband, a dog Dad, a brother, son, friend and a deeply caring soul. Please visualize him fully recovered and healthy, and of course, keep those prayers coming! We have attached a link to a Go Fund Me page if you’re interested in helping out by donating. Every penny will go toward Ron’s care. And finally, please feel free to pass this onto anyone you may think would be interested. We will continue to keep you updated.

Recently, Sam was diagnosed with a large brain tumor, and has undergone two extensive surgeries. The first surgery was to remove the tumor and the second surgery was to remove the infected bone flap which had created a bad staph infection inside his head. Once Sam has recovered from the staph infection, he will need further treatment, rehab and surgeries.As a selfless individual, Sam has helped many people over the years with automotive knowledge, machining and racing fabrication often refusing payment for his services. Now Sam needs your help. Anything you can do will be greatly appreciated. All donations will go toward medical and living expenses. Sam's medical expenses alone have already exceeded $100,000 and will continue to accumulate. We are asking our friends, family and community for your support during this difficult time. To all our Family and Friends: This is OUR STORY that I, Jody, have kept very private, but feel it is now time to share with everyone. Please do not scroll through without reading this message completely. I pray to GOD that he really can work miracles for my Loving Husband Sam Coe.Those of you already know Sam is smart, funny and extremely talented with his engine building, diagnosing, and machinery. He is happiest when he is teaching others or giving to others. He is one of the most selfless people we know. He was self employed for many years and resides with his wife, Jody.On July 11, 2019, Sam was taken to emergency and hospitalized. After a CT scan and MRI, his doctors discovered he had a seizure and a very large brain tumor was found. He was put on anti-seizure medication, and discharged 5 days later, awaiting the results of the biopsy. On August 14, Sam had another MRI for the doctors to have a better understanding of his tumor and look for any growth. It was found the tumor was extremely large and covered both frontal lobes of his brain blocking the cerebral fluid. On September 7, the doctor informed Sam and Jody the tumor is a rare genetic tumor made up of proteins and mutated enzymes including BRAF and MEK, which is a low-grade cancer. Due to the size of the tumor and the risks involved in removing it, the doctor recommended shrinking the tumor with experimental medication. Therefore, with no other choice, Sam began taking the medication in October. The medication caused his blood pressure to rise to a frightening level to which the doctor’s decided they needed to remove the tumor immediately. The next morning, November 1, Sam underwent an eleven hour brain surgery to remove the tumor. Sam spent the next 16 days in ICU and another 4 days on the hospital floor, before being sent home.Over the next 3 weeks, Jody has been his caregiver at home. Sam now suffers from short term memory loss, has difficulty finding words to communicate appropriately, a hard time understanding communication and understanding simple instructions. He has a difficult time remembering people, including his family members. He is not able to distinguish the difference between dreams/memories and reality. He gets confused in his surroundings and around his environment. The constant immediate care has been extremely challenging. We fear for his health and his safety if he does not have constant supervision.Sam was faced with yet another battle to overcome on December 15. He was admitted to the hospital again, because he developed an infection from the brain surgery. On December 16, he underwent a 2nd brain surgery, this time to clean out the infection and remove hardware that was previously placed over his brain to hold the bone that was removed in the initial surgery. He currently remains in the hospital until further notice.With the medical expenses that have been accrued, and lost wages with Sam unable to work, and Jody unable to work to be able to care for Sam, Sam and Jody are facing extreme financial hardship. Sam has a long road of recovery ahead of him and the financial burden has already become unmanageable. Unfortunately, due to insurance and finances, we are unable to provide Sam with a nurse in the home to help with his care, or have help from a rehabilitation facility, or a skilled nursing facility. He will need ongoing speech therapy to help him with his communication. He will need to have another surgery in February-March. This will be to put in new hardware and an artificial bone, to replace what was previously removed due to infection. We are asking for your help in donating for Sam’s medical expenses and Sam and Jody’s living expenses. We would like to provide Sam with the best possible care to have the best possible outcome, although in the current financial situation we are unable to do so. We appreciate you taking your time to read about Sam’s story and thank you from the bottom of our hearts for yoursupport in this matter.God Bless everyone!

Brian lives in a small town that doesn’t have access to public transportation or offer public assistance to help him with everyday tasks. For more than 20 years, Brian’s mother (Bonnie) was his primary care taker. She would drive him to and from jobs, doctor’s appointments, and every day normal activities. She would assist him with bathing, dressing and food preparation. A few years ago, Bonnie began to struggle with health issues of her own, suffering from both COPD and rheumatoid arthritis, compounded with a couple falls and a need to carry oxygen. When her illness progressed to the point that she could no longer assist, Brian started having to pay out of pocket for his daily care, as he waits for state assistance. On April 23, Brian’s mom passed away. It was her 69th birthday.Brian now lives with his retired, 74-year-old father. Not only are Brian and family devastated from the loss of Bonnie, but find themselves even more financially burdened due to their fixed incomes. Brian’s father, a retired truck driver, is finding it hard to obtain work in their area and is unable to assist with physical tasks due to his age and health. This leaves them having to pay out of pocket for a care taker, plus the normal monthly utilities, food and mortgage.Brian needs a means of transportation so he can get to and from a job and help bring in more household income. His local Vocational Rehab is willing to modify a vehicle for his needs, but Brian is responsible for purchasing a van with particular specs, and has less than 4 months left to do so before the approval expires!! Brian is asking friends, family and good Samaritans to help contribute to his independence. We all know what a struggle life can be, even for the able-bodied.

When my dad was diagnosed with myotonic dystrophy, a type of muscular dystrophy, in 2006 we never thought his health would decline so rapidly. Our family never dreamed we would have to make such life changing decisions at my dad’s age, 51. After moving to San Antonio in 2009 for a job which he had for 8 months, he has not been able to work since then. In 2011 he had a pacemaker put in. In 2012 a peg tube/ feeding tube was placed in his stomach so that he could receive extra nutrients and calories through a supplement, his weight went from 170 pounds in 2006 to 145 pounds in 2012. In 2013 we made the decision to take his driver’s license away and sell his car because his reaction time decreased. Toward the end of 2015 he was completely confined to a wheelchair because he became too weak to walk and took bad falls on a daily basis. My mom took care of his 24/7 while she works a full time job to support them. On April 3, 2016 my mom rushed him to a San Antonio ER because he fell through a wall at home and was talking out of his head. He was admitted and diagnosed with pneumonia. While eating lasagna one night, he aspirated on his food and was rushed to ICU where they connected him to a respirator. We were told that he was in critical condition, his pneumonia was worse than they thought and he would never be able to eat solid food again. After being on the respirator for a week, they placed a tracheal tube in and connected a breathing machine to it. He was moved to a Long Term Acute Hospital a week later. He has been at the LTAC Hospital for 15 weeks and has been in ICU the whole time. On June 17, 2016 he had a heart attack and mild stroke and we were told he would not survive the night. He did survive, but he is not the same as he was before the heart attack. He has trouble with his memory on a daily basis, has trouble speaking and forgets who his family members are at times. His bills continue to come in, due to long hospital stays and specialist seeing him on a daily basis. If he is ever released from the hospital, he will more than like have to be moved to a Skilled Nursing Facility and perhaps rehab likely for the remainder of his life. We are asking for donations to help afford rapidly growing hospital bills and long term care for my dad. We are hoping to reach our goal by the end of September. Thank you for all of your prayers, support and generosity.

To me, she’s been a pal since 3rd grade, “Friendliest Girl” of MBHS class of ’79, and lifelong confidant. We ended up in separate parts of the Atlanta area as adults and have been able to meet for a meal or coffee at least a time or two each year. Through her career in youth ministry, she’s made countless friends who know her affectionately as “Elo.”Elizabeth’s StoryAt the end of 2019, Elizabeth amicably left her job at Mount Vernon Presbyterian Church and Mount Vernon School, where she had served as a beloved Minister to Youth for almost 22 years. A restructuring of church leadership and ministry roles led to this decision, which was difficult for all involved. The church generously provided Elo with income through the end of May and a career counseling program to help her plan next steps.Little did anyone foresee the kinks that Covid-19 would throw into this good plan. The career counseling and job search were stalled amid lockdowns, and the income flow ended before new employment was secured. In September, Elizabeth became ill with coronavirus. As her symptoms cleared, it became apparent that something still wasn’t right; she had difficulty with speech and mobility. Admitted to Northside Hospital, she was discovered to have suffered a stroke, attributed in part to concurrently diagnosed Diabetes.After more than a week of hospitalization and two weeks of inpatient Rehab, she returned home but realized after a fall that she was not yet ready to live independently and could benefit from short-term Respite Care. A senior advocate helped her locate an assisted living facility (Sterling Estates East Cobb) where she is learning to manage her diabetes and continues to regain physical strength with the help of on-site physio staff and programs, along with prescribed home health and PT/OT visits. Elizabeth looks forward to returning home to her kitties and independence, but at this point can’t say how long she will need to remain in Respite Care. She uses a walker and cannot yet drive or tackle household chores, but is striving for full recovery with her characteristic strong effort and positive attitude and is making progress. When she leaves Sterling Estates, she will need to move from the apartment where she lived for 22 years and make a fresh start in a new home with greater handicap access, yet to be located. Then her job search will resume. (She’s interested in advocacy work, if anyone has a lead for her!)Please follow her CaringBridge site for progress updates and to send encouraging messages: https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/elizabethsmallMany of you have asked, “How Can I Help?”Limited visitation is allowed at Sterling Estates because of pandemic restrictions. None of Elizabeth’s relatives live in Georgia. We local friends are doing what we can to help Elizabeth with errands and such. Until she is well enough to make a move, resume her job search, and gain employment, Elizabeth is faced with staggering expenses related to her treatment and recovery as well as general living costs. While social distancing limits all of us in many ways, a most helpful way we can support Elizabeth is to contribute donations of any amount to her GoFundMe account. She will be able to use these funds as needed to help make ends meet – on her high medical bills, expensive Respite Care, relocating, rising apartment rent, meal delivery, housekeeping, etc. – until she is fully recovered and back on her feet again.

On October 13th our whole lives crumbled as our beloved Witek Gazda suffered an accident while on a business trip in Texas. All we know is that traffic stopped suddenly, and he tried to save himself by landing on his side but the impact was so strong that he hit his head and had to be immediately airlifted to the nearest trauma center, where aggressive brain surgery was performed. If you know Witek you know he is a friend and brother to many, a kind soul to all, and the most incredible dad anyone could ask for to Victoria, his daughter, and Karolina, his stepdaughter. Everyone he ever talked to could see his good heart sparkle through his eyes and was instantly at peace when with him.

We flew to Texas the day we found out and the news we heard was the most devastating thing we've ever heard: his brain is so damaged, and if he survives, he will never be the same. After the initial shock, we knew Witek would want to keep fighting, especially for Victoria who is only 13. He is her whole world - a loving father, tennis and mental coach, travel buddy, and best friend. We believe with all of our hearts that with proper rehabilitation and being around his family and friends, he can recover. This rehabilitation needs to be early and aggressive and designed especially for traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients.

We are not giving up. Witek was in a coma and a few weeks ago he finally opened his eyes. His consciousness is not regained, we don’t know when that will be, but he needs this early aggressive brain rehabilitation in order for this to happen. We know he can hear us, especially Victoria. When he hears us, he opens his eyes, tears fall down his cheek, he makes faces. We know he is there and he has been very brave, even after multiple surgeries, including most recently another brain surgery to place his bone flaps back in.This is why we are reaching out to you. This all happened so suddenly and we need all the help we can get to bring Witek back home to New Jersey to a TBI Rehabilitation Center, so he can be with his daughters, family, and friends. We are experiencing difficulties with health insurance, as they do not currently want to cover his care in rehab, which costs about 5,000 a day, or roughly 150,000 a month.However in order to see any improvement in Witek’s condition rehabilitation is required, there’s no other option. We can not afford this money, but Witek needs rehabilitation as soon as possible. We are working hard with lawyers to appeal the insurance decision. Any amount of money can help us greatly and will be dedicated for his care. We love him so much and are not giving up on him. May God bless everyone for your help. Please keep him in your prayers.

Wersja polska: 13-tego października nasz ukochany Witek Gazda miał wypadek w trakcie delegacji w Teksasie. Jeśli znacie Witka to wiecie, że jest bratnią i ciepłą duszą i najlepszym ojcem pod słońcem dla Victorii i Karoliny. Polecieliśmy do Teksasu, gdzie usłyszeliśmy okropne wieści: Witek ma bardzo poważne uszkodzenie mózgu i jeśli przeżyje, nigdy nie będzie tym samym człowiekiem. Nie było innego wyjścia - postanowiliśmy zawalczyć o Witka bo wiemy, że by sam chciał walczyć i zrobić wszystko dla Victorii, która ma jedynie 13 lat. Witek jest jej całym życiem, kochanym ojcem, trenerem do tenisa, psychologiem i najlepszym przyjacielem.

Witek był w śpiączce, ale pare tygodni temu w końcu otworzył oczy. Nie jest jeszcze świadomy ale okazuje znaki, że nas słyszy: otwiera oczy, puszcza łzy, pokazuje grymasy na twarzy. Szczególnie reaguje na Victorie. Dzielnie przetrwał pare operacji, w tym operację mózgu by włożyć część kości czaszki spowrotem do głowy. Witek potrzebuje natychmiastowej agresywnej rehabilitacji bez której nie ma szans na powrót do przytomności.

Zwracamy się do Was, gdyż opieka i rehabilitacja Witka będzie kosztować bardzo dużo pieniędzy, a ubezpieczenie niestety sprawia bardzo dużo problemów z opłatą. Rehabilitacja kosztuje 5000 dolarów na dzień, 150000 na miesiąc. Będziemy walczyć z ubezpieczeniem o pokrycie ale w między czasie potrzebujemy wsparcia pieniężnego. Każdy grosz i każda modlitwa nam pomoże. Błagamy o pomoc dla Witka i szczególnie dla Victorii, która potrzebuje swojego ukochanego tatę.

He was coaching the Wyoming Cowboys boys' basketball team at Northwest High School and thanks to the help of the Wyoming coaches and fans, he was immediately taken to the hospital and treated by UC's Neuro ICU team. He lost function on his left side and had to fight for his life. Through strength and perseverance, Randy survived the stroke and has been putting all of his efforts into rehabbing and piecing his life back together. This has proven to be the challenge of a lifetime. As his daughters, our roles as his greatest supporters and biggest cheerleaders have been put on hold to navigate the frustrating waters of insurance cut offs, age restrictions, and facilities with hidden costs and fees. He does not qualify for Medicare or elderly services because of his age. Each day has been dedicated to finding a way to keep him in a safe place and facilitate his recovery. He is currently unable to be home as he cannot be left alone due to fall risk. We have deduced that he will need to continue his rehab in an assisted living facility that has 24/7 care, because of falls and help with showering, dressing, etc. Insurance continues to deny our claims to keep him in skilled nursing, so we are currently paying thousands of dollars out of pocket on a weekly basis. The 6 months following a major stroke is the most crutial time for regaining brain functionality and neuroplasticity. For now, the assisted living facility is the best place for him to be as they're able to provide him with the care and rehabilitation that is needed for him to go on and live independently. As these costs addup quickly with no help from his insurance company, we are asking for help with the assisted living costs. Our dad is a proud man but we have to appeal to loved ones to help him in his recovery. Continued prayers and positive vibes are always needed. We are hoping to give him a chance to focus solely on his recovery so he can get back on the bench by next season.Thank you for your support, prayers, and kind words.-Michelle, Jamie, & Julie ReynoldsRead more"

She was immediately life-flighted to UPMC Hamot in Erie, PA where she underwent an emergency craniotomy to relieve the pressure and stop the bleeding on her brain. The pressure was so much that her brain had been pushed all the way over to the right hemisphere, causing damage to the left side of her brain.The craniotomy was successful and slowly, over the next week, Janeane started making progress. The ventilator was removed, she was breathing on her own, she started to regain some feeling on her right side, and she began trying to talk again.Unfortunately, during an angiogram that week, the doctors found a large, abnormal cluster of aneurysms at the base of her brain. They needed to wait a few days until she was a bit stronger before they could do the necessary surgery on the aneurysms. That Friday morning right before her surgery, she was strong enough to tell her daughter and son, “I am fine.”When the doctor came out to tell us that the surgery went exactly as planned, we all breathed a sigh of relief and cried tears of joy. At that point Janeane was already off of the ventilator and they were waking her up.The next thing we knew, the doctor came back - there was a complication and Janeane had some internal bleeding at the entry point in her femoral artery. It was hours before we knew just how bad the situation was.Janeane lost 1/3 of her body’s blood and her blood pressure dropped to 40. Luckily, she had an amazing team that day that saved her.Unfortunately, she was put back on the ventilator and again heavily sedated at that point. A couple of days later, tests showed that she also had pneumonia, amongst a host of other issues, including vasospasm, that her doctors and nurses had to treat.Janeane is a fighter, but with the complications after surgery, she had quite a setback. Because Janeane wasn’t able to sufficiently breathe, swallow, or cough on her own, her doctors performed a tracheotomy in order to remove the ventilator that was in place for several weeks to help her breathe. Doctors also relocated her feeding tube from her nose to her abdomen, which allowed her to try to talk and to begin some physical therapy. Janeane was in the Trauma Neuro ICU at Hamot for 4 weeks. Next she was moved to an in-patient rehab facility that focused on respiratory therapy. They successfully got her to the point where she is now breathing and eating on her own and her tracheotomy is nearly healed. The day after Christmas, Janeane was moved to another in-patient rehab facility that is attached to Hamot and is focused on physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. Their goal is to get Janeane home but, even though we have seen positive progress, it is a long, slow process and she will likely be there for 1-2 months.Right now, we are just taking things day-by-day.As you can imagine, the financial burden associated with this terrifying situation is unthinkable. Not to mention the physical and emotional stress. Not only are medical bills a concern, but the additional expenses associated with the nearly daily travel to and from Erie, meals for Paul, and likely having to renovate their house to accommodate her needs when she returns home are things that we don’t typically think about in these types of situations. On behalf of Paul and Janeane, we have started this GoFundMe campaign to help alleviate some of the financial burden that they are facing and to provide them with as much support as possible. Paul has been by Janeane’s side day in and day out and our hope is that by lessening the financial burden, they can focus more on Janeane’s care and, more importantly, we can show them that they are not alone!   Although we can’t change the past, we can help them get through it and look forward to the future.Please continue to keep Janeane and her family in your prayers, and send good thoughts whenever you can. She truly has a heart of gold and we know that she will get through this. If you are able to make a donation, it is greatly appreciated! Thank you so much for your support!Read more"

Just as he shared special memories with you at your own family gatherings and celebrations, Manny and Martina shared with you their own family’s achievements - college graduations, their daughter Dennise (35) landing her first job out of graduate school in a hospital in San Francisco, Hernan (30) moving out of state and then returning to the Bay Area, and Diego (32) helping out at the restaurant during the week - in many ways we have grown up together.While it cannot be left unsaid how COVID-19 has impacted small businesses, especially the service industry and restaurants, Manny and his family decided to keep Almaden's Tacos Al Pastor open for business, and did not lay-off any staff, while adhering to strict health and safety guidelines. They continued to keep their community nourished through this difficult time.Outside the taqueria Manny and his family have been dealing with another challenge. In mid-August Manny began to experience fatigue and weakness in his left arm and leg. Theythought it was due to the strain and demand of the day-to-day at the taqueria. Little did his family know they were in for a big surprise.Manny was admitted to Good Samaritan Hospital on September 8 with stroke-like symptoms - the inability to move his left arm and leg, disorientation, and slow speech. He was at home when his wife noticed he was unable to move, even falling out of bed as he tried to roll over on his side. He was taken to the hospital via ambulance and about 2 hours into his emergency room visit, doctors had run his blood work and taken images of his brain. Manny had indeed suffered a stroke.By day two his family was told the situation was much worse - Manny had clear cell renal cell carcinoma, cancer that originated in his right kidney and had metastasized to his lungs, bones, and brain (including the tumor that caused the stroke). This news was devastating and completely unexpected. There were no symptoms prior to the stroke. While at Good Sam, Manny began receiving whole brain radiation to help reduce the brain lesions. Manny stayed at Good Sam for 10 days before being transferred to their acute rehabilitation unit to recover from his stroke and before beginning cancer treatment.In acute rehab, Manny works with a medical team of physical and occupational therapists to help him regain strength and movement in his arm and leg, and be able to do activities of daily living, independently. Manny remains optimistic. The team at Good Sam’s acute rehab center has been awesome - the doctors, therapists, care coordinator, social work, and especially the nurses. Manny knows everyone on a first name basis, very much like he does with his customers at the taqueria, and everyone loves working with Manny.In addition to the loss of income from COVID, Manny does not have insurance. Let's show the Rosas family the love by raising money for Manny's cancer treatments and his stroke recovery. And please support Almaden’s Tacos Al Pastor-- my favorite is the fish tacos!!Manny and his family very much appreciate the outpouring of support and love you have already shown and they look forward to sharing good news with you soon.There is a 2.9% credit card processing fee charged by gofundme.

On arrival at hospital I was informed that Oscar had a bleed on his brain and needed life saving surgery otherwise he was going to die.The surgery was performed and he was taken to intensive care. After five days he become very unwell. A CT scan was done and it showed a significant accumulation of the bleed. He was again rushed into surgery for a second craniotomy and evacuation of the extradural haemorrhage. After the surgery Oscar deteriorated and I was told to go and sit with him and get my family to the hospital quickly, as he was so poorly and we were now looking at his survival on an hour to hour basis.Luckily Oscar started to fight for his life and he started to become more stable. He stayed in intensive care for two weeks and although alive and he was showing no signs of response.He was transferred back to our local childrens hospital and spent six weeks there. Oscar did begin to open his eyes but there was still no response from him. He remained in a minimally conscious state for his time at that hospital.He was then transferred to a Neuro rehabilitation hospital miles away from home. Leaving him there was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. I managed to travel the 160 miles a day round trip at least five times a week.Eventually Oscar began to wake up. He managed to give signals such as a thumbs up or pointing his finger. He stayed at that hospital for ten weeks and then was well and aware enough to come back to our local Neuro rehab hospital.Oscar stayed in this hospital for the next five months. He had surgery on his ankle to release the tendons in his leg so he could walk again.The physiotherapists managed to get him standing and taking his first steps again. All together Oscar was a inpatient for nine months. The care we received in all of the hospitals that Oscar has stayed in was excellent, and I can not thank the Health care assistants, Nurses and Doctors enough. As well as caring for Oscar they looked after and supported me completely. He was eventually discharged back home in August of last year.We always knew that Oscars recovery would be a very slow process and he has done so much better than any medical professionals thought he would. His diagnosis is a severe traumatic brain injury, this has left Oscar with a left sided weakness, mobility issues, (a wheelchair user) damaged eyesight, difficulties with speech (oral dyspraxia)and (orally apraxic) he uses a ipad to communicate with people. He cannot eat or drink properly and has a special diet.Oscar has come a long way in the past 15 months but after a break in therapies due to waiting lists he is only receiving 1 hour of physio and OT a week and just 1 hour of speech and language therapy every 2 weeks. Its simply not enough he is so desperate to get better and really keen to do more. He needs extensive therapy to get the most out of his future. He has so much potential to make a good recovery.Unfortunately we have no funds to pay for extra sessions. I have had to give up my career to become Oscars full time carer. That is why I am reaching out to anyone who could possibly help us with getting Oscar as well as he can be, so he can go on to lead an active, happy and productive life.Read more"

When battling at home under doctor care wasn't enough, Hannah was taken to the hospital. That same day she was sedated, intubated and airlifted to Carle Hospital in Champaign. Currently she is in the ICU at Carle Hospital. The complications of COVID have given her Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Flash Pulmonary Edema. Hannah is being given ECMO treatments which leave her sedated and confined to her bed in ICU for at least the next 45 days. Hannah truly is in the fight for her life! When she does leave the hospital she will have extensive therapy and rehab to rebuild her body from this disease.As a young person, Hannah has not had the opportunity to build up a 'rainy day' fund and bills still need to be paid - not to mention the medical bills that will add up over the next several months. Hannah's family will be travelling to Champaign for visits when allowed, need gas, food, and potential overnight stays. Many friends and family have asked how they can help so this fund is the way to support Hannah and her family at this time. As needs change throughout the next several months, this will be updated.

Unfortunately, on the 2ndof January, after her morning swim, Christine suffered a massive bleed into her brain from a burst cerebral aneurysm. Any one of us could have an aneurysm — something we could be born with but will never know that we have, until it bursts. This was totally unexpected. Luckily, Christine knew, after her swim that morning, that something was very wrong and she called an ambulance. This saved her life since the major bleed happened when she was in hospital where she was able to receive immediate life-saving medical treatment and be admitted into Intensive Care where she was nursed on life-support for the next week. However, she was not out of the woods — just days after Christine’s brain operation, she suffered complications which resulted in an ischaemic event (a loss of oxygen) to part of her brain, leaving her with a stroke.Christine almost died, and we are very lucky to still have her with us. Christine is only 42 years old. She is a very smart, fit and healthy proud single mother of two high achieving boys, aged 12 and 14. She is an amazing quiet achiever herself who has survived this adversity and has come out of it being determined to get better for her two children. One of the first things she said when the breathing tube in ICU was removed was: “Tell the boys I’m not going to die”.Christine still has a long road to recovery ahead of her. For the moment, she will be in the Neuro-Rehabilitation Unit for the next 2-3 months. Right now, we don’t know to what extent she will recover from this brain injury — the best-case scenario is that Christine will be able to come home to be with her boys if we have the right equipment, however, she will not be able to return to work for at least the next year.Our family are all pitching in to support Christine and her two boys, for as long as it takes.We will be there to get her through her Rehab and the years beyond. However, she also needs increased financial support to help her get through these early stages of her recovery to secure and maintain her children in their home. Home is currently rented accommodation, so we are also trying to secure a more permanent home for our sister and her family, so that she can make the necessary changes for her rehabilitation, as rented accommodation will not allow structural changes to take place. For instance, she will need a bathroom to accommodate specialised equipment such as a wheelchair, shower equipment and lifting machines (to name a few). She will also need a movable bed, as well as continued intensive physiotherapy and hydrotherapy sessions.We have had many wonderful offers of help, which is why we have started this ‘Go Fund Me’ page on her behalf.Any help that you can give to Christine and her boys during this time will be greatly appreciated.Thank you all very much for taking the time to read our appeal to help Christine.On behalf of Christine and her family, may you all stay safe in 2021.Read more"

This is my grandson Owen. Owen was born May 25, 2016, 10 weeks before we expected him. He weighed 1# 14 oz.He spent his first 7 weeks in the NICU.

But don’t let his tiny stature fool you! This kiddo is a champion prize fighter, punching way above hisweight class!He is a loving, funny, joyful boy!

Owen has cerebral palsy as a result of his premature birth. On April 13, 2021, Owen is scheduled for a surgical procedure on his spine called a Selective Dorsal Rhiziotomy (SDR). The goal of this procedure is to reduce the spasticity in his legs, allowing him to move more freely.

The typical hospital stay for a SDR is 6 weeks, which is followed by 6 weeks of 5 days/week outpatient rehab at Gillette Children’s Hospital in St. Paul. Then Owen will continue therapy closer to home.

Owen’s parents Nick and Kelly will be staying at the hospital with him initially, then Nick will return to Fosston to work and care for brother Brodie.Nick will travel to St. Paul as much as possible to visit Owen and give Kelly a break away from the hospital.

Owen’s medical costs will be mostly covered by insurances. But there will be expenses associated with travel, housing and meals away from home. There is also the loss of income that primarily Kelly, but also Nick, will incur.

As with most families, Nick and Kelly will do anything for their child. And, as with any young family, they have household expenses that require both their full time incomes.

I am asking on their behalf for donations to help defer some of these extra expenses and to keep their household afloat during the 12 weeks of recovery and rehab. Some funds will also be used for the specialized equipment Owen will need for rehabilitation.

We greatly appreciate your donations!

He had practiced and gone to training schools for about a year but did not get off the ground. Three weeks ago he went to Edgefield, SC and got off the ground. He was so excited. He loved it. He went the next week and flew again. The entire time he was training we would ride the countryside looking for places for him to fly. He was so excited when a friend that he's done a lot of work at the church of from Lugoff, SC said he could fly from his property. He just needed to cut the field to make a runway.Vance left home at 8:00 am on Saturday, April 11th and cut the field and the friend's yard. He returned home about 4:00 pm and told Jeannie ""Let's go and you can film me while I fly, I want some good videos.""After his second attempt he got into the air. He flew about 20 minutes and the last time he came around he was flying too low. Jeannie was filming him at the time and when he went out of sight, she heard a loud boom and couldn't hear the paraglider motor any longer. It was deadly silent. She immediately knew he had crashed and was frozen with fear. She called their youngest son, Bailey and told him that his daddy had crashed. She took off running and found him across the road. When she got to the crash site, he was surrounded by 7 men trying to help him. Someone called 911 and the ambulance arrived about 10 minutes later, followed shortly by a medivac helicopter.During this time Vance was unconscious and non-responsive. The EMT's intubated him on scene and rushed him to the helicopter. Bailey arrived on scene and he and Jeannie rushed to the hospital, where they were told they had to remain outside due to COVID-19. They were devastated and remained outside for a long time hoping to hear updates. Finally a security guard came and informed them that the only way the hospital would have allowed them in was if he were dying, so it was better that they were outside. They were informed that his vitals were good and the doctor would call them. They returned home and began praying and called multiple times throughout the night for updates. Jeannie was not able to talk to him until day 3 when the ventilator was removed. He has a severe concussion, two serious brain bleeds, a brain injury that controls his ability to walk, a broken right arm, two broken ribs, and a presumed broken foot that ended up not being broken. He is also suffering from a collapsed right lung with an air leak in the lining of it.He is supposed to be transferred to a rehab center in Charlotte, NC for brain injuries hopefully by the end of the week. This has been an awful 8 days in the hospital with major pain but some progress.Vance and Jeannie are self employed full-time as Gospel singers and with Vance doing PA system work and projection systems in buildings, including churches when they are not traveling. He will not be able to work for a few months at least and they are trusting in Jesus for every step as they move forward. He will recover according to the doctors but it will take time and much therapy.They covet your prayer support and love and would appreciate any donation you can provide.

He attended Central Washington University and has always been surrounded by many loving friends and family. Kevin started a sales position for the past 6 months while running his new business, a food delivery service, he recently started with one of his friends. He is a lover of all kinds of sports, fitness, socializing with friends, and being close to his familywith his future being very bright. On the night of Wednesday, October 7th, Kevin was a passenger to a car driving home from Des Moines when the driver lost control and the car rolled several times before finally hitting a tree. 911 was called immediately. His right shoulder and his head were the most impacted from the crash.Shortly afterarriving at the hospital, the doctors didn't waste any time and started to perform surgery on him, first to remove 6 inches from his skull. The second procedure was to stop the uncontrollable bleeding that was occurring from behind his face which needed a second surgery after it began bleeding again. Then the list of procedures that the family has learned has just kept getting longer. Kevin will be undergoing many more operations on his face, which has experienced extensive facial fractures, fractureson his C2 vertebrea and possible fractures on his C5 and C6 vertebreas, not to mention possible brain injuries.The good news is, Kevin will survive. He will most likely have to live with what has happened through rehab and recovery for several years and he may not be the same Kevin everyone knows and loves, but he will survive. He has even responded to the nurses that have asked him to wiggle his toes and raise his right or left thumb and he does! The journey to get back to a normal life will undoubtably be a long one and that is why the Bird family could use your help! Every single penny raised for Kevin will be going not only towards his medical bills but also his rehab and recovery months after. Though the bills have not been received yet since theaccident has happened so soon and Kevin's injuries are still not fully known, the projected cost of this horrible incident will be costing the family six figures, even after insurance.The time is now. Kevin needs as much support and prayers that he can get to get his life back to normal. His strong-willed nature along with all the love and prayers he has already received has been helping him get through this so far but the journey is very long from being over.Any donations to Kevin are extremely appreciated by his family as they are experiencing this difficult time.

This page is created for the sole benefit of Baby Hunter and every penny donated will go directly to his mother, Amy Henderson, for living and care expenses for her her children during this unexpected family tragedy. On 12/2/20 HUNTER was diagnosed with Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumor (ATRT) a rare and fast-growing cancerous tumor of the brain and spinal cord that will require extensive therapies and months of hospitalization.Hunter is such a sweet, happy and loving boy! He has always loved to dance, loved music and songs, Mickey Mouse, pool days in the summer and playing in the leaves this fall, just like any one year old boy full of life and energy. He has an older brother and sister who love him to pieces and is a big mamas boy, who loves being spoiled and loved on by all those around him!On October 23 Hunter got admitted to Levine's children hospital where he stayed for days. He was unable to hold food down and was having noticeable mood changes so he had GI testing, endoscopy, camera down his throat, biopsy to try to find answers. Everything was negative. So he was sent back home. After getting back home he had good days and bad days. Still having the same problem with food staying down and constipation. So on Nov. 21 he goes back to Levine's. Shortly after being there he was in ICU and they did a CT scan, things took a turn for the worse. Something a mother never wants to hear, that they were going to have to do brain surgery to remove a large mass on the brain. After he had an MRI to take a better look at what they were dealing with and how to take it on, he went through a 4 hour complicated brain surgery to remove a large mass on the back of his brain and were faced with the possibility of damage to his nerves during surgery. Surgery did not go well as hoped and excessive bleeding required blood transfusions . The tumor was intertwined in his nerves and the surgeon removed most but not all of the mass. The surgeon who removed the tumor said it was in the top 3 of the worst brain tumors he has experienced out of 2,000 surgeries for Hunter's age. Now began the wait of what kind of tumor this was and if it was treatable.Dec 2, We got results from the pathology report and the news was not what we wanted to hear but despite all these horrible things they still have a plan developed for treatment. Hunter is strong and we know he can fight through this. But it’s going to be a long hard road. Hunter has a very rare cancer called Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid tumor which available research indicates a near 50% survival rate after treatments. He is now on the rehab floor to gain strength to prepare him for this treatment process he is about to endure. He will be in rehab 2 weeks then will start CHEMO with three 28 day courses over a 6 month period. Following CHEMO he they will then determine the type and duration of any Radiation Therapy. Just typing this information is hard enough and the though of this child being subjected to this harsh process is a hard pill to swallow and brings excessive worry and fear over potential side effects and quality of life.Please please please say a prayer that he can handle all of this and he can beat the odds.The family is helping out as much as possible, Hunter's mom, Amy Henderson is such a hard worker and has consistently worked hard to provide for her family and unfortunately has had to put her job aside to be there for her son. She is a single mom who loves and cares for her 3 kids as any good mother would. Amy was also working to become an EMT but of course family comes first. While nothing else matters in the world but to make this child better, she needs all the help she can get while being unable to work, staying at the hospital and caring for herself, Hunter and her 2 older children ages 10 and 12.Any donation to help this mother and her beautiful children during this most tragic time would would be greatly appreciated and will go directly to the care of Hunter and living expenses for the mother and siblings.We are grateful for your love and supportRead more"

This will enable the kids to keep their lives going doing the activities they are.  This has got them very hard! This is the story!Ted Soellner, 48 years old, our brother in law, suffered a stroke Sunday September 4th due to his cardiac condition (afib). At that point he was in ICU with left sided weakness and difficulty with speech.  On Monday night, September 5th, he had a major seizure that made him have a stroke on the other side. He is presently still in ICU, intubated and will slowly be removed off the ventilator once he can maintain breathing on his own. He will need long term care. They are not definitive of his actual abilities he will have but are telling us the damage is large.  He can move his right leg presently and a little on his right hand.  He cries when the kids are mentioned so he has very strong emotions. This will mean down the road the use of a wheelchair and full time care.  Teddy worked for the City of New Britain and although his fellow workers have put in some of their sick time for him, my sister in law Kristene Judson Soellner is self employed and is now the sole care take of their two young kids ages 9 & 6.  This will be a long journey as the doctors have told us.....it will be a long journey and he will eventually be in a rehab facility and Kristene will have to look at potential housing modifications as well as a handicap accessible van. These are things that financially will be very challenging. As the days go on I am going to hold some events, a CrossFit fundraising workout, a pasta dinner and a gofundme account. Please keep Teddy, Kristene & their kids in your prayers that he will make it through this out of the hospital and can have a successful chance at rehab to his bodies best ability. Read more"

In result we need to have emergency surgery 1/5. Tomorrow. If anyone could share this I’d appreciate it. His surgery tomorrow is 4,500 so I’ve updated the GFM fundraiser. This is not including his PT, water therapy, post OP appointments, and rehab. Thank you so much!




If you’ve ever owned a pet- I hope you can understand where I am coming from. I am coming from a place of love and sorrow while making this fundraiser. We are asking for help to raise money for my beloved pup, Archibald. Archie is my German Shepherd. I adopted him on October 3rd, 2018 when he was 7 weeks old. The second I held him in my arms- we instantly hit it off and I knew he was going to be my best friend. Archie was the loudest, funniest, brattiest puppy I’ve had ever seen in my life. He’s truly been the best dog I’ve ever had and could ever wish for. As he grew up, I noticed something weird about him- other than his affliction for rodents. He ALWAYS whines when he runs. Isn’t that so strange? I always thought he was so excited (playing with other dogs) that he just had to express it. He’s talkative at home- so why not now!? We have had a few struggles with Archie along the way, but nothing my tough boy can’t get over. When he was six months months old, I had a strange feeling something wasn’t right. I came home early from class and I found him seizing on my floor. We eventually discovered he had got into prescription medicine and was overdosing. He was moments from death; even the vets were amazed he made he survived. Almost losing Archie is not something my family, friends, or I would ever want to endure again. This is why I am reaching out for help. Around October, Archie started limping on one of his legs. If you are familiar with German Shepherds, you might know where this is going. After a day or two, we realized he wasn’t just overworking himself as he started limping on both his hind legs. I took him to the vet as soon as I could get him in and I got news I was so afraid of. Archie has bilateral hip dysplasia. Until he has the surgery, he desperately needs, he’s on a special (expensive) prescription diet, glucosamine tablets daily and Rimadyl daily for inflammation and pain control. I’m so scared he’s going to go into liver failure being on pills long term. Even after all of that, he is still struggling to run or fetch. He wants to play and go on walks but it’s too painful after about 5 minutes. It’s so sad. After getting several quotes from some of the best vets, my best option is still EXTREMELY steep - especially for a college student. I’m afraid I won’t be able to get Archie the surgery (complete hip replacements quoted 6,500 each hip) he so desperately needs and watching my baby be in pain is awful.Archie is my rock. He was there for me when I had my first breakup, my first semester of college, senior pictures, my wisdom teeth, rough nights, and even breaking my back a week after my birthday. He’s snuggled his way onto my heart and I’m hoping there is some way I can make this work. He deserves to be comfortable- everyone does!! I just miss my happy, loving boy and I hope you can understand where I’m coming from.As you read this I wanted to stress that anything helps- truly! Whether that means donating or spreading the word, Archie and I appreciate it!! Thank you so much for sticking along.Read more"

Whether you climbed with him in The Creek or Squamish, India or Thailand, you know that nobody was wearing a bigger smile than this guy. I've seen him at his best and I've seen him at his worst, either way Craig is always pushing himself to be better. A better friend, a better climber, a better human. Craig has helped me in times of need and I know I'm not the only one. It's time for us to come together as a community and support one of ours in a time of need.Craig was in a climbing accident in Indian creek on November 15th. He and his Climbing partner, Kelsey, were climbing at the Bridger Jacks when Craig dislodged a sizable block from the second pitch. The block pulled him off the wall and landed on him at the belay ledge, smashing his pelvis and cutting his rope in multiple spots. He then bounced off the belay ledge headed for a likely fatal ground fall when the rope happened to wrap around his ankle and his belayer grabbed the rope with her bare hands! This final act surely saved Craig's life. Craig was airlifted to Colorado to undergo a series of extensive surgeries. His injuries include:A Very broken pelvisT1 vertebra burst fractureSacral fractureOpen Radial fractureDamage to the sacral nerves (which has caused some of his internal organs to go dormant. This will hopefully resolve in time but it is currently the scariest of the injuries)I have been working with Craig for the last year as a wilderness therapy guide at Legacy Outdoor adventures, where he helps inspire change and help young men on the path to honorable manhood. Unfortunately the work we do is very physical and Craig will have to take a long break due to his injuries.After hearing Craig speak about this traumatic experience, I know that he is ready for the fight to recovery. Although there are serious long term emotional and physical challenges on the path to recovery, his humility and drive remain his strongest tools. He is extremely grateful for his life, and the amazing team of friends who literally came together to save it!Any way that you can offer support makes a difference. Whether it is sending a text of love, endless nights of board games during recovery, or a donation toward his medical bills, your support is much appreciated.At this point, there is really no way of knowing the total expense that will have to be paid out of pocket, and the final number won't be known for upwards of two years, when his recovery is finished. We do know that it will be a hefty sum based on helicopter flights, intensive medical support, supplies, surgeries, and the very limited number of rehab days on Craig's insurance. It is unlikely that we will raise more than the need, but if that somehow happens, Craig wants it to be very clear that this money will only be going towards medical bills and costs directly associated with the accident (i.e. not a new sprinter). If we happen to raise any excess of funds, it will be donated toward an emergency fund for future adventure enthusiasts in need.PS: Craig reminds us all to wear a helmet!!! His saved his life.Read more"

I am a friend and sister-in-law to Renee. Together with other friends and family, I wanted to assist Renee with her fight and thought that this would be the best way. I hope that the Ballarat Community and others that live far and wide will help. So please take the time to read Renee's story. Renee (32) and Mark are the proud parents of two little girls, Sienna (6) and Charlotte (4). Renee is a loving and caring mother who wants nothing but the best for her children without ever asking for anything in return. Together, like most parents, they always try and put the needs of their children ahead of their own.On Wednesday the 13th of July, 2016, their world was turned upside down. This was the day Renee was diagnosed with cancer. Numerous scans, blood tests and biopsies revealed that Renee had a tumour in her spine. It is a rare tumour that Doctors are lucky to see 20-40 of these in Australia each year. They are usually found in long bones, where the only option is surgery, however, Renee had this tumour growing inside a vertebrae of her lower back and it was now protruding into the soft tissue surrounding her spine. Unbeknown to Renee or Mark, Renee's back was actually broken due to the vertebrae collapsing as a result of the growth of the tumour.Renee has been in hospital since this date.On Tuesday the 26th of July, 2016, Renee underwent herfirst surgery to treat this tumour, nicknamed Terence. After six hours Renee returned a little worse for wear but in good spirits. On Wednesday the 27th of July, 2016, Renee underwent a 12 hour surgery in which doctor's removed the vertebrae and replaced it with a titanium object called a spacer and built a supporting cage out of screws and rods. She spent a night intubated in the ICU. Needless to say she is in a lot of pain and will remain in hospital for some time.At present Renee is attempting to walk again. She can now walk a little bit further than yesterday, however, each day is filled with highs and lows.Her constant companions are Wally, the wheelie walker and Betty, the back brace. Mark is currently trying to maintain some semblance of normality for the two girls, whilst also supporting Renee through her rehab. Unfortunately, Renee's sick leave entitlements from work have run out. This means that whilst expenses are increasing and medical bills are starting to arrive, funds are also being stretched. They are now reduced to a single income, with Renee unlikely to receive a salary until next year at the earliest. At present they are attempting to sell their house in order to make ends meet. I would love to take some of the stress away from them. Through the funds you kindly donate, I hope to lessen their financial strain by helping with medical costs and general expenses for the girls. Every little bit helps, even sharing Renee and Mark's story with others. Thanks for your time.Read more"

I hope it gives you an idea of why we are asking for help. I hope it inspires you the way they have inspired me.I remember the first time I met Rod. He was quiet, nice, and the mysterious guy who made my sister happier than I had ever seen her. I was seventeen and maybe things were skewed because I was a teenager but I new love when I saw it. The love that Jen and Rod share has lasted almost 30 years. I remember when they remodeled their first house and while it was under construction they would write I love you notes on the studs of the torn up walls. It was like a reminder of what their love was building. It was beautiful and set the standard for how I believed a truly loving relationship should be. They have always been an inspiration to me.They have two amazing kids together, Clint and Abby, and made sure to include Rod's daughter Jenny from his first marriage. I have had the honor of becoming very close with these kids and can say that Jen and Rod have raised some beautiful humans. They are a couple of my favorite people and that is a testament to the amazing parents Jen and Rod are. They created a unique and amazing family that welcomed friends and extended family into their circle. I had the pleasure of being one of those who was welcomed. They allowed me to live with them and supported me through my college years. I would not be where I am today without them. Anyone who knows them knows that they would give you the shirt off of their back to help someone they love. They are people who deserve all the happiness life has to offer. Lately that happiness has been torn away from them.On January 13th we received the news that Rod has cancer that has spread to his brain. He began radiation and chemotherapy treatment and made it through one round of each. After the treatments he suffered massive stroke and is now paralyzed on the right side and unable to speak. He will need to be admitted to a acute rehab center to try and get his speech and mobility back. If he is able to come home from the rehab center Jen will have to retro fit the house to be wheelchair accessible. The level of care and attention he will require comes at a cost. A cost that is out of reach for most families living in our country today. This is why we are starting this Go Fund Me page. They would never ask anything of all the people they helped and now it is our chance to return the favor. I ask you to donate to help them through this horrible time if you love them, have been helped by them, or have had the pleasure of knowing them. When making this donation know that you are giving to a family that would do the same for you in your time of need.The situation they are in is unfair and dire. If you have experienced the destruction that cancer causes you know the pain of watching your loved ones suffer through this horrible disease. My hope is through this Go Fund Me page we can lessen the helpless feeling this disease leaves on all of us.

We just celebrated the beginning of our seventh year of our marriage and the entry of our daughter into our lives. While my wife was pregnant she had developed issues with gallstones. In pregnancy this is a common occurrence as your body is reacting to all of the changes within pregnancy. It was nothing to be concerned about, and they couldn't go in an surgically intervene because it would have significantly taxed Josephine while she was in utero. On December 6th Laura started having significant abdominal pain. The pain at that time was due to a suspected gallbladder attack. She suffered through attacks for nearly three days until the morning of December 9th. That morning, Laura woke me up saying, ""Darin, something has gone wrong. We gotta go."" At that time, Laura and I went to the ER in Central Iowa Healthcare. Once arriving it was determined that it was necessary to perform an emergency C-section in order to remove Josephine. From the time the C-section was called until when it was performed was 8 minutes. Josephine was born at 8:07 am. She was born healthy, and at that time Laura was doing okay too. She was a little tired from emergency surgery but all was going well. That didn't last long though. As they day entered into the night Laura's condition declined. Her heart rate increased, and she started developing a severe fever. At that time it was speculated that Laura had developed pancreatitis. Laura stayed in Labor and Delivery for less than a day and was then transferred to the ICU in Central Iowa Healthcare. She was being kept stable but her condition didn’t improve. She was then sent to Mary Greeley Medical Center because she couldn’t receive the care she needed in Central Iowa Healthcare. While at Mary Greeley Medical Center she was given a CT scan in order to find out what was going on. It was quickly determined that she had developed acute necrosis of the pancreas. This condition was beyond the medical care that Mary Greeley Medical Center could provide and she was immediately air evacuated to the University of Iowa Hospitals(UofI). Laura was then admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit(MICU) and they started trying to figure out what was going on. They had determined at that time that around 45% of her pancreas had died and her body was reacting to that trauma. The hope at that time is that she would recover. Laura spent two weeks in the MICU and over the course of that two weeks she suffered through several infections, going into supraventricular tachycardia, delirium and many other complications. She was recovering though. Laura was then transferred to the Respiratory Speciality and Critical Care Unit(RSCCU). Laura spent one week at RSCCU she continued to show signs of improvement, was walking more regularly, and slowly but surely coming back. She had fought off the infections and was continuing to recover. Laura was then transferred to the Acute Rehab Facility at Covenant Hospital to face an uphill battle in her recovery. Laura ended up spending less than a day at rehab as she started to show a significant temperature, and her heart rate was once again racing. As her condition developed it was decided to send her back to the UofI via air evacuation. That was the last time I heard my wife’s voice, the last time I felt her squeeze my hand, the moment my life would change forever. Upon arriving at the UofI she was sent immediately to the emergency room to undergo an operation. The doctors didn’t know what was going on only that she was very sick. After the surgery we started to get a picture of what had happened. What is believed happened is that her pancreas ruptured or burst. This ended up spreading infection throughout her body. The infection got into her blood vessels that fed the lower colon. As the lower colon wasn’t getting blood it died and perforated. Her abdomen when they went into surgery was full of fecal matter, infected fluids, dead tissue, and dying tissue. Through the surgery they removed as much of that stuff as they could. Due to the infections Laura will end up losing at least a foot of her colon. She will have to wear a colostomy bag for the rest of her life. Laura also had to have her pancreas removed. The whole pancreas was dead and it needed to go. As a result she will be insulin dependant for the rest of her life. It is unknown at this time if the other organs in that area are impacted by the infection. When they did the last surgery there was soo much damage they couldn’t see what else was impacted. They couldn’t even find her gallbladder to remove it. In Laura’s immediate future is several more surgeries to continue to remove dead or infected tissue. She is currently in a medically induced coma as she cannot breathe on her own because she went into respiratory failure. Machines at this time are doing everything from breathing for her, keeping her blood pressure up, collecting urine, collecting bowel movements, and many other functions of living. In Laura’s long term future is an acute long term rehabilitation facility. There are a few located in Iowa but none are located near to where we live so we will need to move. We will need to sell acar, and change everything. I have no idea how much this will end up costing. I have no idea when this will end. I have no idea if my wife will live as the current mortality is 50/50. The funds that are donated will go to the care of Laura at the rehabilitation facility, at the hospital, and for the care of her daughter. All remaining funds will be donated to the American Pancreatic Association to hopefully help others with similar conditions. How did this start? A gallstone fell from her gallbladder into the common bile duct . It’s speculated that this stone blocked the passage of fluid through the common bile duct. The liver, gallbladder, and pancreas continued to produce enzymes and fluids as they normally do but the fluids couldn’t flush into the intestine. The fluids started to build up and entered the first organ itcould - the pancreas. This caused an infection and inflammation in Laura’s pancreas.How bad is it? Laura’s condition right now is the worst that the University of Iowa Hospitals has ever seen. They see necrosis of the pancreas on a regular basis. Laura’s is that bad. How is Josephine? Josephine right now is getting excellent care. She is loved by many and is being cared for by Laura’s family. She is a beautiful, strong, and independent young lady that really hates it when her hat covers her eyes. Why should I donate to you? I wish I had a good answer for this. I do. There are many people that need help and we are just one of many.Who are you and who is she?

She worked to build a program for music therapy at Rieman and secured several contracts for them. She ended up getting her dream job as a music therapist helping veterans at the Iowa Veterans Home not to long after college. She had achieved her dream job and that was amazing for her. She continued to do some work on the side for REM Iowa as a music therapist helping those that had developmental delays or special needs. That was her Laura before all of this happened.

In August of 2020, Zach and his family found out he had been living with an orange-size arachnoid cyst in his brain. He was having minor symptoms that seemed to resolve and the neurosurgeons decided the plan was going to be to monitor the cyst for six months in hopes that the symptoms would not return.



Zach was then in and out of the hospital a few times throughout the rest of the year with pneumonia and an abscess in his lungs that persisted causing multiple hospital stays. After that had resolved he then had his first seizure the day after Thanksgiving. The neurosurgeons assumed this was the cyst causing the seizures and decided draining the cyst in January of 2021 would be best.



Later in the year Zach was then diagnosed with covid-19 and could not be with his family for Christmas. Zach had already been through the ringer and his health problems seemed to never stop. Zach remained positive and in good spirits because he knew he would get through any battle that was in his way. Zach and his family were were finally able celebrate Christmas in Rochester the week for before his surgery.



On January 20th, Zach went to surgery to drain the cyst. During the surgery Zach suffered a seizure and a stroke causing right sided deficits. The family knew that it was going to be a long road to recovery due to the stroke but were grateful the cyst was drained and he was medically stable. However, Zach then began to have seizures due to blood in the cavity where the cyst was. Zach then had a two day stay in the ICU at Highland Hospital. Zach then fought a hard battle to get out of the ICU, back to an impatient unit at Highland and then finally to an Acute Rehab unit at Strong Memorial Hospital.



Zach has had severe pain, struggles and the weight of a difficult battle in front of him. Zach has already made so much progress, regaining strength and making huge strides towards recovery. He is stubborn in the best way and a warrior against the hardships he has had to face. He has fought for his friends and family with the support of everyone around him and their prayers.



The medical bills and therapies Zach has needed and will need for the future will be extensive. He has had a rough road for a 23, almost 24 year old and it isn’t over yet. We want him and his family to be able to focus on him and the recovery rather than the financial part of the hospital stays and the therapies.





His friends are looking for any and all support for him and his family. All prayers, support and donations are welcomed and appreciated at this time. Thank you so much to all friends and family of the Gillards. We know Zach will get through this and be on to the next adventure.

A crusher throughout, he helped to start some of the most iconic brands in the climbing industry, including Pusher and The Front Climbing Club (originally the Body Shop). For the last 20 years, he has been an organic vegetable farmer, bringing many in the outdoor community together every week to pick up their CSA share from his family farm. There are few that don't know his name, and there are even fewer that have been more socially influential and nurturing in the community than him.  In the spring of 2016, David was diagnosed with Stage 4 head and neck cancer. The prognosis has always been grim, but Dave wanted to try and red point this thing. After a year of various treatments including chemo, radiation, and immunotherapy, he is needing in-patient health care as the margin for error in his daily care is thin.The healthcare industry and David’s insurance provider currently refuse to pay for any kind of in-patience rehabilitation or care and expect his family to care for him at home. There are a myriad of reasons why home care will not work at this point. David’s wife Jill (who has been a hero in managing his care and treatments so far) has a job and three kids at home with a fourth in Portland. Dave had been very hesitant to ask for help over the past year but, it now seems appropriate at this point. So, here we are, trying to get him into an in-patient facility with hopes that basic physical therapy, nutrition, and care can create a greater baseline health to extend the time and platform for his current treatments to work (immunotherapy, 25% chance of results), and for new treatments to be started, including a new-to-the-market option (genotherapy treatment, 80% chance of results). Of course, in keeping a realistic view, if treatments fail, the funds would be put in a trust to be used for his children. Quality in-patient care is $15k-$30k per month. We are likely to use Aspen Ridge Transitional Rehab in Murray. This care needs to start in the next day or two, as he is about to be released from a recent hospitalization. We are currently focused on raising $100k+. A non-profit is being setup so that donations can be tax deductible. We will continue to try and convince David’s insurance that in-house care is needed, yet, we are unwilling to stand idle while that *%$& system makes decisions.Read more"

WE MADE GOAL FOR TY, AND THEN SOME ... IN LESS THAN ONE WEEK!If you still wish to contribute in order to help Tyler with his various needs, you can send a check to Ty's fiancee, Sarah Hughes. For her mailing address and other info, you can email Sarah at [email redacted].__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________As many of you know, almost three years ago in January, Tyler had a massive and devastating stroke at the age of 32. We’ve since learned that it was due to a hidden lupus-like syndrome that caused his kidneys to clot and his blood pressure to spike so high that it caused a major brain bleed.The stroke has left him with many setbacks but two in particular are his inability to use most of the right side of his body and aphasia, which is a communication disability for speech and language comprehension. As a result, he has been wheelchair dependent and he’ll need to be on a blood thinner for the rest of his life (to prevent any future clots).Despite these setbacks, Tyler has made some progress:1. He survived two very intensive brain surgeries;2. After serious damage to his kidneys and being on dialysis for two years, his kidneys regained enough function to no longer need 3 days per week of dialysis (which is very draining and makes a person feel as if he has the flu);3. Thanks to the committed efforts of professional speech therapists, Ty has regained some ability to say a few words and sing a line or two on rare occasions;4. Most recently after testing positive for COVID (November 30) at his long-term rehab facility where he’s been for about 2 years, he has thankfully bounced back after several weeks.Through all of these very difficult challenges, Ty has persisted. Fortunately, there is a light at the end of his tunnel -- that he’ll finally be going home to live with his fiancé and Carolina, their English Lab in Scituate, MA, hopefully this winter.In order for this to happen safely, Ty will need a wheelchair accessible vehicle so that he can be transported to his various medical and therapeutic appointments. Accordingly, Sarah recently found a 2019 Dodge Wheelchair Caravan with 40,000 miles at Mobility Works in Woburn MA. The total cost including taxes and first year of insurance is $22,000.Since this is a substantial additional cost for Ty's care, we are hoping that his friends and extended family will want to show their care for him with donations that will make this purchase for Ty possible. We understand that 2020 has impacted so many people financially but no amount is too small and if you can’t, we completely understand and simply ask for your continued thoughts and prayers.Tyler is our miracle and inspiration. We have no doubt that being home with Sarah and Carolina will motivate and improve his continuous recovery. The state of Massachusetts will provide a home nurse to come on a daily basis while also allowing physical, occupational and speech therapists to come frequently to facilitate Ty's recovery.PLEASE NOTE: The default tip amount to GoFundMe might be rather high, so make sure you set it to what you want. You can set it down to zero if you prefer.Also, Ty's fiance Sarah Hughes, and his Mom Jorie Hunken are also part of Ty's fundraising team, so if you prefer to deal with them directly, you can contact them at their email address:  Sarah -- [email redacted]   or   Jorie -- [email redacted]Thank you all in advance - it means the world to us and any donation will truly impact Tyler’s future for the better. He and his family will be forever grateful to all of you.Read more"

Lee is one of the most determined individuals you would ever meet, and has his heart and mind set on regaining use of his lower body! The only way this is at all possible with a complete spinal cord injury is with possible benefits of stem cell surgery. Although still in experimental stages, stem cell surgery is showing much promise in various hospitals out of the country. Since this procedure is in early stages it is, of course, expensive and not covered at all by insurance or other institutions. It is also presently only offered outside Canada and the U.S. Stem cell surgery saved Gordie Howe after his stroke – and there are many new developments in China and England as well as other parts of the world in stem cell research as a possible treatment for spinal cord injuries. With the permission of Lee and his family, we are setting up this fundraiser to appeal to family, friends, colleagues, and anyone willing to help make a difference to raise funds for travel to receive possible surgery and any additional rehab costs needed to help Lee to regain as much function as possible.Much research will be done before choosing where and when to go, to ensure all is legitimate and progress for Lee is definitely possible!Please share this campaign and story and support Lee in his progress and recovery.Lee’s StoryLee has always been an impressive athlete. In high school he was a leader on senior football, basketball and baseball teams. His coaches still speak of him as one of the top athletes they have ever coached. He was also an honour’s student and impressive academically as well. After high school he was accepted into several University Engineering programs, but chose Ryerson so he could live at home and save money. He played baseball for Ryerson during first year and played for Leaside junior team in the summer. He was a top hitter for Leaside, and also pitched when needed. This spring he was throwing harder than ever and hitting well again for his team. He loved paying baseball and was thrilled being an important asset for the team. To help pay for the costly Engineering program at Ryerson, he needed a summer job and in May, he thought he was lucky to land a job cleaning windows and eaves. On June 23, 2015, Lee Melymick was seriously injured in a workplace accident after a fall from over 20 feet. His spinal cord was completely severed and he was diagnosed immediately with complete paralysis from the waist down. At times his pain was unbearable. There were several complications and problems that occurred and additional surgeries and medical procedures were required. There were also many times all involved were not sure Lee would be able to survive this ordeal, but he did. During his 70 days in trauma hospital he lost over 70 pounds. Lee went from an athletic strong 210lbs to a fragile 135lbs on his 6’4” frame. Finally, after a third surgery in early August, Lee began to slowly make healing progress. He was able to move to a trauma ward and out of intensive care.In early September, Lee was released from trauma hospital and moved to a rehab facility, where he is still receiving physiotherapy and occupational therapy. While the costs of the actual medial care will be provided by Workplace Safety Insurance Board (WSIB), there are many associated costs that are not included—like purchase of a special vehicle, medical procedures out of the country, some alternate rehab, etc.—and it does not cover any stem cell treatment. Payments by WSIB are based only on lost wages, and nothing is allotted for pain and suffering. His dad Mark has even met with MPP and senior advisor to Minister of Labour in an attempt to change legislation to be more helpful to worker’s who obtain serious injuries. This will take years.Support from all who know Lee or any of his family members is extremely meaningful and appreciated by Lee and all his family. The “Stand by Lee” slogan is a play on the old popular song “Stand by Me” and the old military expression “Leave No Man Behind” is the slogan that Lee’s close friends have put on T-Shirt’s to let him know they will indeed stand by him and not desert him in time of need. It is a perfect description of the incredible support that has been there for Lee and his family since the day of his accident, from his family, friends and community. About LeeLee is a 20-year-old, third year Engineering student at Ryerson University, and is the son of Mark Melymick and Teresa Haubrich and brother to Luke. He grew up in Toronto and attended Sunnylea Junior School, Norseman Middle School and Etobicoke Collegiate Institute. In high school, he maintained honour roll grades and was a team leader on the football, basketball and baseball teams. He spent every summer of his youth visiting family and friends in Saskatchewan, where he took also took swimming lessons and attended baseball camps. He was given numerous academic and athletic awards and accolades in high school. Last year while in second year Engineering Ryerson, his team of four won the Junior Engineering competition then represented Ryerson in the province-wide competition. In addition to working during the summer, Lee was also a valuable member of the Leaside Junior Baseball team. Those who have met Lee, know what an amazing individual he is. His quiet, calm, kind, intelligent nature has impressed all who have met him through his 20 short years. Canadian Actor Kim Coates, and Man in Motion Canadian hero, Rick Hansen, have both made visits to see Lee in hospital and both have been greatly impressed and impacted by how Lee has coped and handled this tragic injury. His incredible positive attitude has brought many to tears. Lee is bright, kind, hardworking and has so many other qualities, and he deserves to have the best opportunities to recover and improve. There is no doubt that what he will achieve in the days, months, and years ahead will impress beyond expectations!He and his family are grateful and thankful for any support you can offer. Please only contribute what you can afford and an amount you will not miss, or notice is gone. The total cost of travel, surgery and associated rehab is still note certain, but will most likely exceed $80,000. The family will somehow cover any shortfall. If there is an excess of what Lee needs, funds will go directly to spinal cord injury research to help others. Lee’s parents—both teachers—have both dedicated their lives to helping others, and now they need your help. This is an opportunity to help someone who truly deserves a break, and help spread awareness of problems after spinal cord injuries! Our other hope is this will help bring this the spotlight back on trying to find a cure/solution these horrible injuries that plague far too many! Thank you so much for any help you are able to offer! We encourage those so inclined to set up their own creative fundraising events for “Stand by Lee” and then contribute funds raised. One idea that came up that wouldbe fun (and cheesy, in a good way) is for the singers out there torecord a video ofa version of “Stand by Lee” and we can post a compilationfor all to see. Thank you all for helping Lee in any way you can!When the night has come, And the land is darkAnd the moon is the only light we'll see, No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid,Just as long as you stand, stand by LEE.Oh come on, come on, stand by Lee, oh stand by Lee Oh stand by Lee, stand by Lee.Lee's friends made these 'Leave No Man Behind'T-Shirts and brought them over when he was home on a pass at Thanksgiving.

Help Alex heal! This fundraiser is to help Alexander Diacopoulos on his road to recovery. I’m Christina Melendez, Alex’s life partner and now full-time caregiver. Alex was the victim of a hit-and-run assault. We hope to raise money to help cover uninsured medical bills, basic living needs, and ongoing medical treatment for his chronic mental and physical conditions.  Alex is a 26 year old Virginia Beach local. He went to Bayside High School Health Sciences Academy where he played varsity and club soccer, before graduating from Randolph Macon College with a Bachelor’s degree. While attending school, Alex began work as a bartender. He was infatuated with flavors, food, spirits, and pairings. He quickly became a hidden treasure of the 757 restaurant industry. He had recently earned the title of General Manager at the Mermaid Winery in Norfolk, when a tragic accident changed his life forever.

  On June 28th, after a night of work at the winery, Alex was driving home on Llewellyn Avenue when his vehicle was struck by another driver. The driver was speeding and ignoring traffic signals. The impact caused Alex’s vehicle to collide with two more roadside structures before landing in someone’s yard. Alex was rendered unconscious upon impact, while the other driver fled the scene in a different, unknown vehicle. It’s difficult to think about how a stranger’s criminal neglect has dramatically changed Alex’s life, but we are forever grateful to the good people who came to Alex’s aid and called emergency services.  An ambulance transported Alex to Norfolk General Hospital ICU. He sustained several severe injuries including hemorrhaging on the right side of his brain and multiple fractures in his face, shoulder, and pelvis. Alex spent 7 days in the Neuro ICU. It was touch and go for the first few weeks: unstable brain bleeding, potential abnormal masses, facial surgery, neurostorming, and the risk of Covid-19 were just some of the obstacles Alex had to overcome. From head to toe, the left side of his body was unresponsive, even to the most painful of stimuli. We didn’t know if his personality would be different, how his cognitive function would be impacted- if he would be able to talk, walk, or even breathe on his own, ever again. What we did know was scary- that his diagnosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a chronic condition that he would live with for the rest of his life.  After 45 days spent between 3 different hospital wings, Alex began to show great improvements. While he wasn’t able to talk, he began writing to communicate. We were so relieved to see that the Alex we know and love was still there, and that he wanted to work hard on getting better! (Fun fact: the first sentence he wrote was “yo tengo farts!”) Alex relearned how to breathe and eat on his own, and had even began to rehab his left leg, arm, and facial muscles. He began mouthing and whispering words til he regained strength and function of his vocal chords. Alex was finally discharged and it was time to transfer to an inpatient center. Doctors estimated a minimum of 2 years of rehabilitation. However, because of lack of health insurance, inpatient rehab centers denied him entrance. But Alex is a fighter, and he was not deterred. He began outpatient therapy as soon as he was accepted, at the Sentara Brock Cancer Therapy Center.

  Alex is still fighting hard. Despite all of the challenges we face everyday, Alex still rehabs 5 times a week, up to 3 sessions a day. He participates in speech, physical, and occupational therapy. Even if its just him and a family member rehabbing at home, Alex gives 1000% every time. We hope to raise money to help pay for this ongoing medical care. Alex is now finally insured, but unfortunately the insurance refuses to pay for his first month in the hospital. We are hoping to raise money to also help cover the almost $200,000 in uninsured hospital care.  Alex’s recovery will be long, but there is no question he will do everything in his power to heal. Alex’s goals are to recover from broken bones, regain strength and function of his left arm/leg/face, and successfully cope with memory and cognitive deficits. We hope you can share his story and donate to his cause. We are thankful to everyone who is helping Alex heal!Much love sent to all.❤️

I had lost my dearest cousin to motorcycle homicide. I had a seizure and next thing was I was diagnosed with a horrible disease called “Scleroderma”. I was told, I would never have kids and I loved kids. My mental consciousness were so disturbed. My grades were going down. I did not know what to do. I was so lost in sorrow and depression. Reading more about the disease, I thought there is nothing left for me. My disease was taking over me. My body was getting harder and changing. I refused to go for Chemotherapy because I was scared I would never have kids.One day I thought, I couldn’t change what has happened and what will happen but enjoy my life till I can. I made a bucket list and I travelled. Experiences made me wiser and happier. I meet a wonderful guy who later became my husband. I told him about my disease and he did not hesistant. He was there for me in sickness and health, despair and happiness. Luckily, I got pregnant. It was happiest day of my life. We had the most complicated pregnancy in the hospital, we were told to terminate our child even at fifth month of pregnancy. My health started getting worser.I underwentpreterm labor at seven month, but my doctors intervened and did a wonderful job to stop it. I was put on oxygen to prevent preterm labor. When Jolene was born, I had labor for less then 30 minutes. Our life was filled with joy and a miracle child. However, my story does not end here. My happy story ended on a bitter note when my lungs failed the very next day.  My vitals were down; I flatlined. I was on the precipice of death. It felt so close that I felt no pain. Fortunately, my doctorsagain, saved my life.For four blissful months, my disease was in remission. I was off oxygen, I was with my baby and husband. Then, as the seasons changed,in October 2013 I was diagnosed with Pulmonary Fibrosis. Pulmonary Fibrosis is when your lungs tissue change into scar tissue making it difficult to breathe. It is the most devastating disease at all. My prognosis of 2-5 years. I was again put on oxygen. My only hope for full recovery was a double lung transplant. I was assessedfor Lungs Transplant Evaluation. I was rejected twice. I even applied for Stem Cell Transplant, I was rejected there too because of thesevereness of Scleroderma. In Feb, 2014, I was diagnosed with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, Even with supplementary oxygen, my body was not getting sufficient oxygen. I was put on various medications.In April 2014, Scleroderma was in full recurrence. My skin started getting very hard like wood and stone. My hands started deforming. I couldn’t bend my body. I couldn’t comb my hair, take shower, when I was eating my spoon would fall out of my hand. I had no strength. I was simply dying. My search for treatment were limited. Doctors told me they could nothelp me. I had so much pain because of internal structure was changing. My respiratory, digestive, circulatory systems were failing. My lungs transplant team then sent me to another doctor, who changed my medication. It didn’t improve a lot but my skin started softening. For me it was like miracle.Finally, in December 2014, I was listed for lungs transplant. It was the best christmas gift ever. I cried, there was still hope. I could still very well see my daughter grow up. Currently, my DLCO of my lungs right is 9%. Lung Volume is 32 %. I use 8/15 liter of oxygen and my PAH and PF is severe.Despite everything, I still make my appointments, I go to my therapies, I go to rehab, I run support groups for my young patients. I still have hope that I will be just fine. I will be oxygen life support free.The best part of this disease is, I am a happier person now then ever before. This is my strength and its making me stronger and stronger. I might look like I am disabled but mentally I am not. I have learned to appreciate life as it comes.Life is wonderful, when you accept what you are and what you have. It is sometimes hard to accept this reality because there is no direct answer to any question but you have to keep looking. There should always be hope in your heart and faith in yourself.With this in my mind, I ask for your help. My insurance will not fully cover the costs of transplant. I don't have any cards to play other than to ask for financial help from kindred spirits like you all. It will help me to be Dual Listed in another center increasing of chance of lungs transplant to come soon.Now, it is just a waiting game. Waiting for the call to change my life.I may be worn out, but I will not let this disease defeat me.Looking for a miracle,Regards,Prasha TuladharTeam Hope For PrashaRead more"

He's a terrific kid, a gentle soul, a great athlete, an amazing friend, and a beloved son. Last week he dove into the Bay at the Jersey Shore and nearly drowned. He hit either an object or a shallow floor. Amazingly, a friend's mom and sister, both nurses, were there to get him out of the water and get him breathing again. He was then airlifted to the trauma center in Atlantic City, where they stabilized him.The most significant injury is that he shattered his C4 vertebrae. He's since had two surgeries to graft the bone. These have been successful.His right side is strong, his left is less so. He's amazed everyone with his quick progress so far, which allowed his medical team to move the second surgery forward a few days. He's fully alert, has his faculties, and is Christian. The reality is that he has a long road ahead starting later this week when he transfers to a full-time rehab facility. He faces months of rehab. There are a lot of uncertainties... Villanova among them.He'll get through this, he's young, strong, and determined.There's been a mantra around here the last few days - ""one day at a time"". That's how Christian's family is handling each day, and that's also Christian's mentality.---(One note about this GoFundMe. I decided to set it up after talking to John and Maria. When I would tell friends the story, friends who don't even know Christian, they'd say ""send me a link to the GoFundMe when it's up"". 100% of these funds will go to support Christian's recovery and rehabilitation.

Ethan has a C3 and C5 spinal fracture, but thankfully has not sustained any brain injuries. He was rushed to the nearest hospital, and later that evening he underwent a surgery to save his life. Three days later, he was medically evacuated to Singapore where he received a second surgery to further stabilize him. Here he was also treated for several other related medical conditions, including: a large blood clot, pneumonia and facial fractures. In addition to his surgeries and procedures, Ethan also endured a 32-hour flight from Singapore to Boston by way of a “Flying ICU” compartment on Lufthansa Airlines, which was operated by a US medical evacuation team. He is currently undergoing intense rehab and physical therapy at Spaulding. Ethan is 20 years old. He is junior studying Political Science at Boston University. This spring semester, he was studying abroad in Sydney, Australia when we decided to spend our spring break together in Bali. The hard work and determination Ethan shows towards his schoolwork is now being applied to his rehabilitation process. Since his accident, Ethan has regained some movement: he is able to shrug his shoulders, wiggle his wrist and slightly twist his legs. With support he can also raise his leg a bit! Ethan has been nothing but a positive force. He is a role model to all of us, and we could not have been blessed with a better friend. During our stay in the hospital, he often expressed worry about both our and his family’s well-being. It was, and still is, the most difficult experience of his life, yet he is always thinking of others. If you know E, you know this is to be expected. He is one of the most kind-hearted, and considerate people we have ever met. Whether you are a stranger or a dear loved one, he is always there to offer support, so now we are kindly asking you to offer yours. Ethan is strong and he continues to fight harder each day.

He turns 3 this July. Last year he had a collision with his sister, head on and it started him on a slippery slope with a back injury. He has been insured with Pet plan since the day he came home at 7 weeks.I nurtured him through what I thought was just a small jolt to the back and after several hours of massage and healing and vet bills, he seemed to recover.In December 2020, I sent him to play pals, a kind of kindergarten for dogs. He only went twice , but it would seem that the excersion was too much for him, even though it had been more than 6 months since the first spinal scare.On Christmas eve he ended up with an emergency spinal operation . The per insurance covered the majority of the bill that came to £5.5k. He came home just before new year eve and was doing really well.Two weeks ago he fell out of my bed during the night. How I don't as we have a super kingsize. Within 4 days he was in pain.. I called the specialist vets on the friday morning who told me to bring him in the following Tuesday and to get some pain killers from the local vet. Which I did . By saturdqy moring he was rushed into emergency surgery again. I have never felt so much saddness come over my whole body. For one week it was touch and go as I was constantly told by the vet. He might die. When he didn't die, they kept telling me he won't walk and to stop having hope that he will. I was finally able to bring him home. He had 12 different medications constant diarrhoea and he was really poorly..My insurance wouldn't pay out again as it's one pay out up to £4k per year. So I had to find another £6200, to pay for his surgery.. curteousy of the credit card. They wouldn't allow me a payment planIn total despair I found myself in a situation that I was not going to allow the vet to take away any hope that my boy had no hope of a decent quality of life. He is totally repsonsive mentally and such a brave, clever little soul.I have been doing physio and healing on him. I've been using essential oils for healing to but he needs to much more than just what I can give him.He is now having instance physio in a rehab centre along with what I am doing for him and the results have been fantastic so far.But of course all of this costs money so I am asking you to donate so that I continue to help my dog Blue Bobz to walk again, get the equipment he needs if the inevitable does happen but also keep him living a decent quality of life.Your support will help him to continue to have the right therapy to help him. This isn't a quick fix. This is something that is going to take some time , because the repetition is what is required so that we fire up his neurological connection to his body. He is going to need many more sessions and vet check ups and MRIs. Tge MRi on its own is £2500. The check up with the specialist vet is £250 every time.This dog means the world to me. To me, he is not a dog, he is my soul son, my confidante, my angel, my best friend.Read more"

She just received news that my Step-dad Paul had been in an ATV accident while on an annual riding trip in West Virginia. Paul was being airlifted to the hospital. Her first questions to my uncle on the phone were “Was his helmet intact?” and “Is he ok?”….. The next 24 hours gave us some of the answers we were looking for. As Paul was wearing all of his riding gear, he suffered only one tiny little scratch and not one bruise. Despite all of his protective gear, Paul had broken his neck between the C6 & C7 vertebrae. He was now diagnosed as a quadriplegic. He is now expected to be reliant on a wheelchair for the rest of his life and also faced with relearning all physical tasks. In the past 6 weeks he has had 2 neck surgeries, been treated at 3 hospitals and now a rehab facility. He has no doubt learned the true meaning of the word patience…..which, if you know Paul, you know PATIENCE is not on of his stronger traits lol. Today Paul has partial use of his arms with very minimal use of his hands. He has no feeling or movement in his fingers and below his nipple line. Despite that, he is excited about learning how to do things for himself again and use what physical abilities he has available to him to their fullest.  Through all of this, it has been nothing short of an emotional roller coaster ride for Paul. Physical trauma aside, he has tried his best to be the chipper smiling Pauly we all love and he is determined to work hard and be as independent and self sufficient as possible. He managed to feed his granddaughter whipped cream last night while watching cartoons in his hospital bed. Now he has an excuse for getting it all over her face. He knows the slow road ahead will be long and challenging but he is excited to get it started with what he has referred to as his “new view on life”. The nurses and therapists are thrilled with Paul’s drive, his enthusiasm and incredible positivity. Paul continually pushes them to work him harder. Starting this week, he will begin to attempt to dress himself and try to maneuver a manual wheelchair. Pauly is the last one to ever ask for help, so I am doing it for him. Looking ahead financially, it will not be easy for Paul as he was the main bread winner in the home. There are some huge expenses to come. In the very immediate future, he will need to purchase a wheelchair (powered or manual depending on his abilities), required home modifications for accessibility ie, chairlifts, slings, shower and bathroom improvements and the purchase of an accessible vehicle to aid in continuing rehab once Paul is released from the hospital. Long term expenses include a lifetime of in-home care, medical supplies and services not covered by OHIP. And at this point there is the uncertainty of how long before he can work again.  Paul has received an outpouring of encouragement and offers for help and support. A simple way to show your support would be to make a contribution for Paul. It would mean the world to this man who never hesitated to help anyone. Thank you so much for everything.Read more"

My name is Melissa Holloman, wife of Brett Holloman and this is our story.Chief Brett Holloman of the Woodfin Police Department is many things: a father, a friend, a son, a brother, a husband and a poppa! Most importantly, Brett is a fighter. As a 27 yr veteran of the Woodfin Police Department, he is used to fighting everyday for the safety of others. Several years ago Brett found himself in a fight he never saw coming - Leukemia! He was young, had two small children, a wife, and many other responsibilities, but the only way for survival was a Bone Marrow Transplant! Brett started his treatment while testing began for a suitable donor! Finally, after lots of tears, Doctor visits, travel and testing expenses, a donor was found and Brett received his transplant!! However, Brett fell in the 3% of people whose graft doesn’t completely take! Brett has been battling Cancer and transplant issues for 20 years! In fact, hejust celebrated the anniversary of his bone marrow transplant on March 27th!!Through the grace of God Brett is living well past the expectency of lifefighting complication from a Bone Marrow Transplant!! He has had countless surgeries -- his knee and hip both have been replaced--and his jawbone has been removed!! He has also had surgeries for skin cancer and suffers from Graft-Verses-Host Disease!! A disease in patients that have aBMT and their body continually tries to kill it. He takes high doses of steroids to help fight this, but there are other complications as a result. Since February Brett has had 6 hospital stays, all amounting from one week to three consecutive weeks each time. In February he was hospitalized for the flu, viral pneumonia and RSV all at the same time!!! He was very very sick and things really didnt look to offer a positive outcome. His Doctor even had some serious concerns about survival!! During his hospitalstay and home care I missed several weeks of work and so did he. I had no PDO so I took internment FMLA with no pay! I have not received a full pay check in months and sometimes not one at all!! But, I know the good Lord has his hands on us and will see us through!! Brett has had several Doctor visits since Feb. Two of which, he traveled to Baptist Hospital!He has a place on his head that needs to be removed, may potentially need knee surgery again and all of this will continue to keep us both out of work!He has elevated Liver functions, an elevated Thyroid, weak kidneys andall overpain and discomfort!He is on oxygen at home and still at times struggles to breath. To add to it all, Brett was recently diagnosed with a tumor in his mouth!! It is a rapid growing one and will cause issues quickly!! The prognosis is not good, but we are trying to remain positive!! The Doctors have given him 6 months to a year. He has the option for surgery to have the tumor removed, at Baptist Hospital, but once it is removed he is not able to have chemo or radiation to help with the fight!! So, surgery is his only option and there is no guarantee. However, this past week he feel and broke his pelvis in two places so surgery has been delayed which, in return, will allow the tumor to grow!! We could potentially come out of our window for surgery waiting on his body to heal, but I know the Lord is in charge of everything! I've always knownthe time would come when I needed to be available for Brett 24/7, as I was 20yrs ago!We are all uncertain what tomorrowholds and truthfully Brett could outlive us all, but I need to be realistic and start thinking about what this would look like. I would need to work from home and in my current job that is not a possiblity. I would need to further my education to allow for me be at home and provide support and care. Iask that you please keep Brett andour family in your thoughts and prayers aswe continue through this fight. Brett has a long, long way to go to get past this latest battle. I am asking for the community and anyone else to consider helping us with our bills. We have a house pymt, car pymt, loan pymts, plus your everyday bills. Not to mention the added Dr bills and medication bills. I haven't worked much since Feb 17th and he isn't working at all now!!! We are needing anything to keep us going, and plan for the days ahead whether that means surgery and months at Baptist or the other!! And, to have some extra for anything and everything that could happen during the next several weeks!! Brett is beginning rehab for his pelvic break this week. Please pray for comfort and strength. During this last year, if he is able, I would love to take Brett places he's never been!! To see things and live out his life admiring Gods glory!! Brett is an amazing man and has dedicated his life to God and the service of others. He is a deacon, a husband and devoted father! Anything you can do will be greatly appreciated!!!!Thank you and God bless!!!Read more"

It’s going to make him feel so uncomfortable, but with all sincerity, I know he would do it for me.My best friend and roommate in college Scott Ward, affectionately called “Scooter” (a childhood nickname, not because he uses a wheelchair) by most who know him, is a sports psychologist by trade. More importantly, he is a son, a brother, a husband, a counselor to college students, a coworker, a friend. Scooter is also a SURVIVOR!In 1986 as a freshman in college, he survived a freak diving accident on an obstacle course that caused a high (C4/5) but incomplete injury to his spinal cord. Doctors at first gave him little chance for survival, then gave him little chance for independent breathing or voluntary movement below his shoulders, then gave him little chance for living a full, active life.With the expertise of therapists, the support of family and friends, but mostly with his own initiative and resourcefulness, he effectively relearned so much of life—how to move, to eat, to write, to transfer from his wheelchair to his car and back again, to drive, to focus, to work. He graduated from college, then went on to earn a master’s degree and doctoral degree. I first met Scooter while I was an undergraduate on the track team and he was finishing up his doctorate in Sports Psychology. It did not take long for Scooter to make me feel like we had known each other for years (anybody who has met him knows exactly what I’m talking about). I made it a point to stop by his office anytime I could because he would project so much positive energy it was impossible not to feel better with just a short visit.During one of my stops by his office, I asked him how his dissertation was coming along. Scooter replied in a nonchalant tone, “I wasn’t very productive last night since I flipped over backwards in my chair and couldn’t get up.” Wait…what? Having a new friend in a wheelchair comes with all sorts of questions, but this was shocking to hear. Me: So, what did you do?!?Scoot: Well, my roommate wasn’t at home and it was too late to call anybody, so I just slept on the floor until my roommate got home.This just blew my mind. It made me immediately realize just how tough and bold this guy is. Life literally flipped him over and he just got back up and kept going!I (along with many others) could tell stories all day about how much of an amazing person Scooter is. It is only appropriate that he found an equally amazing wife in Robin. They married in 2005 and have been a perfect fit ever since.Fast forward to October 2016. I will never forget the panic in Robin’s voice when she called me while driving to the hospital in Kansas City. Scooter had passed out in the shower and was unresponsive. He was being life flighted to KUMED after what was ultimately deemed an aortic dissection (a spontaneous tear in the largest blood vessel of the body). This required emergency open heart surgery and doctors had his odds of survival at less than 30%. He survived! However, just five weeks into recovery and in his final stages of rehab he suffered ANOTHER heart attack. This required another risky open heart surgery with even much lower odds of survival. Still, he survived. All of this leaves him with a heart functioning at less than 15%. Scooter never backed down and put everything he had into rehab and gaining his strength back. He went back to work much earlier than anybody had predicted. As a sports psychologist, he counsels student-athletes in all sports to sharpen their mental toughness and overcome barriers of all types. He doesn’t just “talk the talk” he “walks the walk”. This guy was born with a love and knack for helping people find their way. He counsels people to break through the doubt that gets in the way of success. He does this everyday by getting up at 5am to start the tedious tasks of showering and getting dressed to make it to the office or teach a class by 8am. He does this with a heart that is functioning at less than 15% and a major loss of muscle mass and strength. He does this with a smile on his face and still projects enough positive energy to make athletes believe they can run through brick walls. He was born for this!Unfortunately, Scooter was also born with genetic polycystic kidney disease. In 2018 the onset of the disease was sped up by the heart medication and numerous rounds of high-powered antibiotics he had been taking. This situation developed a grapefruit-sized tumor on his kidneys that was initially misdiagnosed as a pancreatic cancer. Days of waiting for testing without nutrition led to even more muscle loss and acute skin break down. Ultimately, his kidneys began to fail and doctors have added two to three dialysis treatments a week that take another 4 hours per treatment out of his day.A few weeks later, he was rushed back to the hospital to correct an extremely high level of carbon dioxide in his blood that had built up over months, likely from low heart function and decreased mobility. He survived that life-threatening episode, too, and now has to use BPAP and oxygen therapy every night.Scooter’s physicians have said that, to their knowledge, he is “an n of 1”—in other words, they know of no one else living an active, productive life with a high cervical spinal cord injury, heart disease and kidney disease. Doctors who meet Scooter for the first time are amazed by his optimism. “He looks better in real life than he does on paper,” and his life reflects that.I’m no doctor, but I could have told you over 20 years ago and I’m telling you now that Scooter is “an n of 1”. He is Superman. He literally changes people’s lives for the better every day with a body full of organs that have tried to quit on him. He is a selfless Superman.Scooter and his wife, Robin, know they are fortunate. They are surrounded by people who care and who have been with them every step of the way. They are grateful for every “bonus day” they have together. They both actively make a living, and they contribute to the community, independently and together. What they are facing now, though, despite paying for and having the best health insurance plan available to them, is a cascade of out-of-pocket health expenses that have drained their accounts and their energy. They pay the portions insurance does not pay for dialysis, BPAP and oxygen support, plus expensive dressings and supplies, and any nursing/physical help he receives at home. Since 2017 Scooter has also battled skin issues, something new to his life of 30+ years in a wheelchair. Deep ischial wounds have required two surgeries and the use of a specialty wound VAC machine. These skin issues are rough on the rump for a guy who spends all of his time in a chair. Believe it or not, these are as debilitating as anything he has dealt with. These issues require the help of Robin and others to transfer him from his bed to his chair every morning and night. He has done everything medically he can do locally and has decided to see specialists and surgeons at the Mayo Clinic to hopefully heal them for good. This final piece of the recovery puzzle could literally put him back in the driver seat and back to his strong and independent life he lived just four years ago.Next month, I will be driving him there because it’s a safer way for him to travel and because he likes my jokes. His compromised health puts him at higher risk of becoming ill if exposed to COVID-19, so surgery, follow-up care, and at least a six-week period of recovery in the Minneapolis area is in store. Scooter will be confined to a hospital bed, eight hours away from home, during a time when visitors are strictly limited. Although insurance is still very helpful, there are expenses that are not covered—tough at any time, but especially during the current economic climate. I am going to trust the expertise from the team at the Mayo Clinic to relieve the stress of his skin condition but I plan to reach out to as many as I can to help relieve the financial stress of this mission. Anything you are able to give is much appreciated. Please share his story and continue to spread the positive energy he has shared with so many.The world would be a better place if it had more people like Scooter. Seeing that he is “an n of 1” means we need to take care of the only one we have!Read more"

When I was six years old, my mom was suddenly admitted to the hospital. I had to stay with my grandmother for a while and was told she’d be ok and not to worry. After two weeks of not seeing my mother, I knew something was wrong and was told “she went to sleep and they’re waiting for her to wake up”. I didn’t understand why I couldn’t just go to the hospital to see her, but I waited.My mother got bacterial meningitis while working for a clinic as a health educator. She went to Wilmed and was airlifted to UNC. She fell into a coma for almost 2 months, and no one under 18 could go into the intensive care unit. Her organs failed, she was on dialysis, she had diabetes, and her lungs collapsed. My amazing father was instantly a single dad as my mother was in the hospital for 4 months. When she finally came out of her coma, I went to visit her and remember having to wear a yellow gown and a mask. When I saw her, she had a tube going down her throat to eat and breathe, and I asked why she was shaking. My dad explained that the coma left her muscles really weak. She was trying to talk, but her words were mushed together. We gave her a piece of paper, but she just wrote squiggly lines. I realized she couldn’t speak or write or walk… or do anything. But I was just so happy to finally see her, I didn’t care about anything else. I was in the room when they told her she had lupus. I thought they’d give her medicine and it’d go away like a cold. I spent Christmas with her at the hospital. On my birthday, nurses came in to sing happy birthday to me. And in late March she was finally home.When I was 9, I finally understood what lupus was. My grades started slipping, I lost interest in school, and I felt no need to open up my feelings because there was so much going on. Even therapy didn’t open me up. I was constantly bullied, had low interest in what my peers were into, and in the 5th grade I got beat up at school. Mom started wearing oxygen, and I started losing my hair in the 6th grade. The bullying continued. My mom put me in a different school, and I’ve made honor roll since. My mom is so present with us. She is full of life and positivity. We do crafts as a family, and she’s just the easiest person to talk to. I’ve had thoughts of “why me” and “why us” and my mom said it’s ok for me to have thoughts like that. She’s shown me how strong we are as a family.Now that I’m in high school, my mom’s health has been deteriorating. My little brother started kindergarten, and when he asks me questions, it makes me reflect back to when I was 6 years old. I feel like a 2nd mom to him. My mom can’t breathe that well, so I do everything I can to help. I take him to school, make sure homework is done, and I try to keep him busy. When mom is not here, I do what she would do with dinner and everything. I try to make it as normal as possible. His grades slip when my mom goes to the hospital. He is very sensitive, so I try to protect him. I do fun things with him like go to the community center, take him to karate, and take him to my high school games with me.Right now, she only has 29% lung function and is on 24/7 oxygen therapy. She just completed 6 months of chemotherapy in preparation for a lung transplant. This November, my parents will meet with her lung transplant team. They’ve been paying out of pocket to qualify, and once she’s officially on the list, they will require the percentage her insurance won't cover. Out of pocket cost of the therapy, rehab, and aftercare costs $52,000. My parents tell me it’s none of my concern. Just to be a kid. Just to be a teenager. I try not to think about it, but I do because I need her, and she needs this life saving procedure. Thank you so much for reading this. Thank you so much for supporting my mom’s journey. Thank you so much Aunt Shon White for helping me do this! I will keep this page updated for those following our story! Check back for our happy ending!!!Read more"

Joe Pushea was my brother-in-law. I never met Joe in person. He lived in New York and I live in Montana. I had hoped to go there and meet him sometime soon but now that possibility is gone.Joe was a very giving man during his lifetime. He helped many people without expecting anything in return. When I brought my wife, Nika, here from Hong Kong I could not qualify financially for her green card because my business did not have enough history. Joe immediately offered to co-sponsor her. Nika, told me that Joe was thenicest man she had ever met. He was more of a brother to her than a brother-in-law.Joe had a stroke four years ago and has been in physical therapy ever since. Since Joe's stroke Nika had been hisbest cheer leader encouraging him in his rehab. She spoke with him at least a couple of times each week and it was easy to tell from the conversations that Joe valued them very much.Last week he took ill. He developed some respiratory issues and was taken to the hospital. A few days later Joe died. The CDC had issued the directive to all hospitals to automatically list the cause of death as Covid 19.However, we do not know for sure. The cause of death could have been any number of things related to his stroke.Joe lived in a suburb of New York City with his wife, Shirley and his 17-year-old daughter, Malaya. His wish was to be buried in Syracuse where his family lives. Joe did not have life insurance. His wife and daughter would like to grant Joe his last wish. A total of $13,000 is needed to cover all funeral costs, transportation and interment. Shirley and Malaya do not have the funds for this. If you are able, could you please donate so Joe can have a proper burial. If you find it in your heart to give, any amount would be greatly appreciated. I thank you personally and also on behalf of Shirley, Malaya and Nika. This would be a wonderful way to honor Joe.

He was transported to Sierra Vista hospital and underwent emergency spinal surgery to stabilize fractures at C5&6 in his neck. He is breathing on his own and has full mental capacity. He also has good use of his shoulders and some use of his arms and wrists. We continue to pray for a full recovery for Ethan and believe that God can fully heal him, but as of now Ethan has no movement or reflexes below his chest and arms. He remains at the hospital for now and we remain hopeful for improvement as the swelling around his injury decreases. Ethan is likely to be transferred to a spinal rehab facility within the week.Ethan has always been very active - gymnastics, hockey, diving - and is a gifted athlete. We are confident he will work hard with a team of specialists at a rehabilitation facility, but his recovery is likely to be measured in months rather than days.Donations will help the Scott family with not only medical bills now and in the future, but also time with Ethan at a remote facility and modifications to their home should that be required once he is ultimately discharged from rehab. Your generous support and ongoing prayers for Ethan and his family are appreciated in every way. Thank you.Read more"

I'm here not to push diversity in comics (this time), but I'm desperately trying to get to rehab after my hip and spine surgery on 11/12/15. Unfortunately, my car insurance thinks me getting surgery and rehab is a waste of time, so they....yanno what, let me start from the beginning. June 4th, 2014changed my life and not in a good way. I was rearended at a stoplight by a young woman who was on her cell going 35MPH. *side note* stay the HELL off your phone while driving, k? */side note*I suffered a concussion, traumatic amnesia, and ridiculous pain in my neck and back. I was rushed to the hospital and after what seemed like a billion hours, I was finally released.Physical therapy for my neck and back 3xs a week plus doctor visits twice a month during the summer. All seemed to be ""okay"" until the evening of September 11th, 2014. I remember having shooting pain in my left leg and ithad swollen twice its size. 0feeling in my leg, plusmy hip - all the way to my pinky toe-was swollen. I was hospitalized for almost 24 hours.After being released, I eventually found a neurologist who ran a battery of tests and after a few months, I was diagnosed with 3 degenerative discs along with sciatica. Doc says the nerve damage in my left leg might be permanent, but who knows. Except for an occasional hollow and burning feeling, I have no feeling in my left leg. In order to keep me from losing my balance and falling, I've been walking with a cane for over a year. I'm currently taking Neurontin 600mg 3xs a day, Oxycontin 40mg 3xs a day, Zanaflex 4mg 2xs a day orBaclofen 10mg at night. And guess what? I'm STILL in pain.Chronic pain 24/7 + pain meds = one depressed Vixen.My car insurance (Progressive) CLAIMSI'mat my medical improvement limit and has refused to pay for my surgery and any other medical expenses. Reached my ""medical improvement limit"", but I can barely walk, stand, sit, sleep, etc. without being in excruciatingpainOh...OKAY.*eye roll*My lawyer has been fighting, what seems like forever, with my insurance to get my surgery covered. The neurologist and surgeon both said that this could improve my health dramatically. How about the IME (Insurance Medical Examiner) suggested surgery would be beneficial, yet...Progressive has continued to deny my surgery.Sigh.Just last month (October) I got the call to go ahead with the surgery and my lawyer's given them a LOP (Letter of Protection), so I'm having hip and spine surgery on November 12th!HOORAY!!!!!But what about rehab? Well...I'm tryin' to go to rehab, but the insurance company said NO, NO, NO! I recently found out that I will not be able to go to rehab, because the rehab center will NOT take a LOP to cover my stay. I have to pay CASH or have insurance coverage. $300 a night and they want me to stay for a week. That's $2100 and it'sNOT including the medicine, heck I don't even know if food is included in this price. ***Update 11/5/15*** The $300 is only for ROOM and BOARD. No meds, no food, no nurses, no physical therapy, the price of that is $700+ EACH NIGHT. (Check update #1 for more details)Since I'm sorta kinda on the broke side, I have no choice but to stay home and take care of myself.Ihave2 amazing girls, 15 and 12, and I don't think that they'll be able to help me when they're in school. Let alone help me to the bathroom, comfort me when I'm in bed screaming while passing me my meds. I mean. I can do it; purchase a potty from Walgreens, stick it in my bedroom, hope I don't mess up the bed/floor. Shuffle to the kitchen and try to make something to eat. Can it be done? Yes. Would I rather not do it? Of course.Soooooo here I am. I'm turning to you all. I need help. If you can spare a buck or two to help cover rehab as well as helping mecatch up on my expenses while I'm recovering, I'd be forever grateful.I don't want to end up behind on my bills and end up losing my place or yanno... whatever, because I'm healing. Recovery time is up to 12 weeks for the spine. While recovering I have to wear an awesome back brace, which looks like a weightlifting belt that doubles as a push-up bra (yes, that's a Jumanji board game).How sway, right? As for my hip; I'm not sure. I get a MRI tomorrow afternoon to find out the damageof the hip from the last MRI scan. It's currently bruised and the pain is ridic!Look. I don't want to do this, it's killing my pride to have to ask for your help, but the reality is...I'm not Wonder Woman or shall I say Vixen and I can't do it by myself. I have to not just think of me, but for my girls. If you can help, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. If you can't help (trust me I know, it's hard out here!), I still thank you from the bottom of my heart for reading and sharing.I know November 12th is 9 days away, but even if I can get rehab for the first 3 days; I'd be so thankful.Thanks for reading earthlings!

This diagnosis only came after he was unable to read a stop sign one day. He visited a doctor to determine the reason for the issue with his vision, as well as the tick bite that was still present under his arm despite a month of time elapsed. A blood test revealed both Alpha Gal and a blood glucose level of 422 (diabetes seemingly brought on by the Alpha Gal). His life changed almost overnight, as his entire diet had to be radically change due to severe inflammatory reactions to most meats, as well as products that include traces of mammal biproducts.Being a self-proclaimed grillmaster, this disease was devastating. But over time, TJ learned how to master new recipes, and he found purpose in networking with others who shared this disease. He just loved exchanging information, ideas, and recipes with others in the Alpha Gal community. He even began an Alpha Gal Only group on Facebook, which has grown and is incredibly active. It is his passion to help others with Alpha Gal thrive.The compilation of two devastating diseases left TJ incredibly vulnerable: On the night of January 4th, 2021, TJ retired to bed around midnight. His wife, Alannah, woke up the next morning and noticed that something wasn't right. TJ was unresponsive, but still breathing, so Alannah immediately called 911. Paramedics rushed TJ to Mercy Hospital in Rogers, AR where he was admitted to the emergency room and placed on a ventilator, clearly in shock. After a battery of tests, physicians determined that he suffered a seizure during the night, resulting in a low oxygen brain injury that has left him mentally non-responsive. He was initially placed on a ventilator and later received a tracheotomy and a feeding tube.Over the next few days, TJ was brought off of sedation, however, sadly he did not wake up as we had hoped. He was treated over the next 30 days for COVID and pneumonia, and continuously evaluated by a number of neurologists, where the consensus was to wait and see if TJ would make a full recovery.After TJ was physically stabilized, he was transferred to Regency Hospital in Springdale, AR, an acute care long term hospital. At Regency, he's been undergoing occupational and physical therapy regularly while weaning off the ventilator. Aside from the physical therapy, however, this facility is not equipped to give him any specialized therapy for his brain injury. Reaching the end of his time with Regency, TJ now needs to transfer to another facility.After much prayerful consideration and deliberation with the family, we have decided that the best hope for TJ is transferring to Hermann Memorial in Houston, TX. Their TIRR rehab program is one of only a few in the country that provide brain rehabilitation with tremendous success. In light of some signs of physical response to pain, we remain hopeful that he will experience a recovery with the expertise of this new facility. We are excited about this opportunity for TJ, and grateful that his insurance is going to cover a large portion of the expense (out of network). Even with the miracle we are praying for, his journey of rehabilitation will be just the beginning of meaningful recovery. The outpouring of support for TJ and the rest of the family during these dark days have provided hope and comfort. So many of you have asked how to help, especially with the financial burden. Although insurance covers the bulk of the medical bills, there are still the copays/deductibles, travel expenses, and lost wages from time off (both for Alannah & TJ). Those expenses are going to grow now that TJ is shifting to out-of-network care and Alannah will be visiting him as much as possible.With your help, these donations will be used to help support TJ's full recovery by covering any out-of-network copays, deductibles, or fees. Any amounts above and beyond that will help cover the cost of transportation and extended stay in Houston for Alannah, as well as additional unforseen expenses that arise when making a huge transition such as this. We are all pitching in to reduce the financial burden on TJ and Alannah during and after this tumultuous time. Thank you so much for your help, and we ask for your prayers in addition to any financial support you can provide.Read more"

The 100 Days will be over on August 8th 2020 and we are trying to raise funds so she can stay another month or at least until the bedsores have healed.On March 3rd, 2020 at around six in the morning I got a call from my mom's cousin, Roberta. Mom was on her way to Vassar Medical Center. She was having trouble breathing. I, of course, got dressed and drove up to see what was going on. They couldn't figure it out at first but after many tests they found she had a heart attack. She needed to have surgery to replace 2 valves and a triple bypass. The surgery was postponed a few days and by the time they were ready for surgery, Corona Virus was creeping into the tri-state area. She had her surgery on March 12th and I stayed with her until she went into surgery and after over 10 hours, the operation was a success. On March, I left her at the hospital at 10PM thinking that everything was great. She was in the safest place possible in this time of uncertainty.March 12th was the last time I saw my mom in person. The next two months would be a roller coaster of chaos, miscommunication and anxiety. She wasn't waking up as well as they wanted and she was having trouble breathing and keeping her oxygen up. After what seemed like weeks, they tested her for Covid-19 and she came back positive.She contracted Covid-19 in the hospital!Now, to make a long story bearable, in the end she was intubated and under sedation for 16 days. On Good Friday, I spoke to the doctor and he was essentially telling me my mom was going to die. She had a 13% chance of coming off of the ventilator and being able to breath on her own. They told me that on Monday, I would have to make the decision that no son would ever want to make. I would have to decide to take her off the ventilator and if she couldn't breathe on her own, she would die. Easter weekend was the longest and the shortest that I could ever imagine. I had to decide if my mother was going to live or die. She told me time and time again that she wouldn't want to live as a vegetable on some machine. We had no way to know what this vile disease did to her mind, not to say what was happening to her body.On Easter, my mom came off the ventilator and was breathing on her own!You often hear about Easter miracles. I actually believed at that moment in time that we were witnessing one. My mom is one of the strongest women I know. She has been through a lot in life and she always came through stronger and ready for whatever life was ready to throw at her. This was only the beginning of a horrid road of fear, depression and worry. You would think that her breathing on her own was the end of the battle... Turns out that it was only the beginning.I thought she had a stroke. And for a month after, I still did.If you speak to my mom now, you'd never think that in late April and early May, she sounded like she was a child. She was confused and if you looked at her, it looked as if the entire right side of her face was paralyzed. It essentially was. She couldn't even hold her mouth closed. It was heartbreaking to see my mom, someone who was so strong, being reduced to the abilities of a child.On May 1st, she was transferred to a rehab facility so she could start working on getting herself as close to normal as possible. She was still very confused. She doesn't remember much but at one point, she actually bit one of the orderlies. As I said, she is a tough cookie! The paperwork that the hospital was very chaotic and jumbled. The head nurse was calling Roberta and I because they couldn't make sense of it.When she arrived at the rehab, she had 5 bedsores the size of a man's fist due to her not being moved in the bed for over 2 weeks. Total Neglect!So, as we are creeping towards the 100th day, we know that because of the bedsores she wasn't able to do the cardiac rehab OR the physical rehab that she needed to in order to live a somewhat normal life. She can stand(not walk yet) with a walker. She needs help to sit up and hopefully soon, the bedsores will be a bad memory. The facility is $500 a day. That isn't a typo. We are trying to get her an extra month so she can get the help she needs now that the bedsores are almost under control.Do not feel obligated!Again, thank you all for looking at this fundraiser and I understand that times are tough. Please share this if you can and donate if you are able. Anyone who donates can have the PDF comic of their choice that I've created. Just let me know what book of mine that you'd like to read and I will send it to you via email.JoeYou can also support mom by purchasing a T-Shirt, mask or any other item at the following link.TeePublicThanks!Read more"

Seeing that Jon was only 41 years old and deemed low-risk, he was sent home with isolation and self-care orders. After five days of isolation, Jon was admitted to the hospital with Covid pneumonia, breathing complications, clotting ensued and a pulmonary embolism diagnosis. Just three days after his admittance to the covid unit, Jon suffered a massive stroke affecting his left side.Following his stroke Jon was rushed into emergency brain surgery twice, first to break up the clot and two days later, removal of part of his skull, to decrease the pressure on his brain. Since then he’s faced complications, from Covid-19, the stroke and now a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, a cancer of his blood. After 4 weeks in the ICU, Jon is still at Jefferson University Hospital for Neuroscience, now in the Stroke unit. Each day brings more medical challenges, requiring interventions at times and constant reassessment by his medical team. All the while, hoping for progress to allow admission to and waiting for bed availability at an acute rehab, where the process to treat all the complications will begin. Jon is strong.Rehab is not the end of Jon’s journey but the beginning. While his perseverance is unmatched, Jon’s journey will be long and full of multiple challenges. It will take a team of doctors, nurses, and specialists to guide Jon through rehab, through cancer treatment at Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, and additional surgery on his skull. It will be our job to make sure that Jon has a safe place to come home to. Medical equipment, home modifications, safe transportation for doctor visits, treatments, home care and emotional support are all part of what we will need so that Jon can come home.So many of you have asked what more you can do. Unfortunately, this will be an expensive journey for Jon. We’ve set up this fundraiser to ease the financial burden and to allow Jon to focus on his recovery. All money donated will be allocated to his medical and rehabilitation expenses.Jon and FamilyIf you’ve met Jon, you know he is all about surrounding himself with family. Whether they are relatives, coworkers, classmates from Bellmawr, Triton, Rowan, team mates from Bellmawr Hockey, Purple Eagles, Triton Mustangs, PBR Softball, or fellow musicians from Uncle John’s Band, the Hard Money, or his latest endeavor; playing keyboard for a startup Peter Gabriel cover band, we all understand how special it is to be part of Jon’s family.As the oldest of twenty cousins, Jon is known as “the king of the cousins.” Their stories of fun times as well as gratitude for his wisdom and advice over the years are heartwarming. His uncles, aunts, and ciocis, boast countless stories of his devotion and commitment to lend a helping hand whenever the need arises.We, his parents Ed and Eileen, his brothers, Ed and Michael, Ed’s wife Ashley, and Jon’s nephew, Nicholas, and nieces, Penelope and Birdie, are all so grateful for the prayers, messages of hope, and healing thoughts sent Jon’s way.Thank you, thank you, thank youThe Family of Jonathan RobbRead more"

For it was on that day that his life changed forever. My name is Carolyn Gentry and I am his longtime soul mate and best friend reaching out to all of you who know and love Mark.Mark had been gradually recovering from a left toe amputation surgery in late August. I had spent time with him off and on during his recovery period and he was slowly getting better after spending endless hours in bed, staying off his foot. Though he was devastated by the amputation, he was finally turning the corner and getting more optimistic about returning to his normal activities. I, by the grace of God, called him the evening of Friday, October 9. He was in great distress. I insisted that he needed to get to the hospital as I knew something was clearly wrong. His friend Gary Dixon was at his home within minutes and rushed him to Piedmont Hospital. This is when his life journey changes, both miraculously and catastrophically.I asked Mark to call me once he reached the hospital but he never did. Instead I received a call from Piedmont ICU the next morning that Mark was on a ventilator, heavily sedated, and on dialysis … a victim of septic shock. I packed up my things and drove to Atlanta and spent the next three weeks at his bedside, watching the medical team work to save his life, performing a deeply invasive surgery called fasciotomy to save his infected left leg, and keeping him on scheduled dialysis. It was difficult to see this enthusiastic lover of life, hooked up to so many machines and tubes coursing through his body. After two weeks in ICU, Mark was removed from the ventilator and on October 26 was moved to the Acute Care unit at Piedmont. A true miracle given the gravity of this medical tragedy!I spent the next week with him in Acute Care, watching him slowly come out of the deep sleep and life saving interventions he endured. Each day he becomes more lucid and each day he adds another piece to the puzzle of his situation, revealing the miracle of his recovery and the difficult fight he has ahead.Many of you know Mark as an experienced, accomplished real estate agent with a thirty year plus commitment to the Atlanta market. Many of you know him as a talented actor with a beautiful tenor voice, a Suzy judge on the Atlanta theater circuit, a creative soul with a deep appreciation for the arts, and a committed member and soloist at Virginia Highlands Church. Many of you know he has two schnauzers and a kitty that he loves like children. And for many of us, we know him as our generous, giving friend who blesses us with his wit, compassion, humor and genuine friendship. And so the story brings us to this point. Mark, if he can continue to improve, faces a long, difficult road to recovery. He will not be able to walk for a long time. He must undergo extensive physical therapy, commit to dialysis for an indefinite period of time, overcome depression and build up a “can do” approach to reinventing his life. We know that he has an indomitable spirit and has often overcome challenges in his life. But this time my friends he will need your help.Mark faces not only significant medical interventions going forward, but also overwhelming financial challenges that continue to mount. Both medical and living expenses must be maintained and he is now disabled for an indefinite period of time. It is my sincere hope that you who love Mark and want to help him will join this campaign. Your contribution will help him transition to a rehab center once released from the hospital while helping him cover the living expenses for his home and vet bills for his beloved fur children.I am grateful for your taking the time to engage in his arduous journey going forward. Your prayers are being heard. He is a true living miracle! Your contribution will be used wisely to give him great piece of mind as we believe he will continue to improve. I promise to be a good steward of this campaign and update you frequently regarding his recovery. Thank you so much.Carolyn GentryRead more"

Local Musicians in Needhttps://www.memphisflyer.com/MusicBlog/archives/2019/04/16/benefits-for-local-music-heroes-in-needPOST FROM SATURDAY APRIL 20thDearest Family and Friends,It saddens us to announce that Omar passed away this past Thursday. Omar fought so hard and never gave up hope as so many friends and family prayed and came to visit him almost every day he was in the hospital. Omar loved so many people from all walks of life and he made sure to always help anyone that came to him in need of advice and would do anything that would bring peace. Omar wanted to continue to do what he loved and was healing others through music and conversation. If you or anyone you care about ever needs help, please fight with every muscle in your body to help them with every ounce of love you can summon. We love all of you so much as does Omar – let us continue to keep his memory alive and cemented in the history books of Memphis Music.Gratefully, David, Joseph and the entire Higgins Family*** Funeral arrangements are being made at this time and we will post details soon. ***This is the original post/story that started the GoFundMe campaign:Omar Higgins has been an activist for the Memphis Music Community his entire life and is known and loved by so many of us. He is truly a servant who cares deeply and loves deeply – always putting others first. He has faithfully performed at benefit shows – too many to count – and gives sacrificially. However - over the years - the grind and pace of his life has taken its toll on him. While caring for so many others he neglected himself. Many of us know Omar as the leader of the premier and award-winning Memphis reggae band Chinese Connection Dub Embassy. He is also the founder and leader of the new four-piece award-winning powerhouse hardcore punk band Negro Terror. Omar and CCDE are also Ambassadors for Musicians for Le Bonheur, which helps raise money for the children at Le Bonheur Hospital. Omar is also a church youth leader, praise team music director and college student with just one class remaining to finish his degree. He loves Memphis and everything it stands for but most of all he loves people just as much as he loves his Maker and his family.Two weeks ago - Omar was having bad flu-like symptoms and was feverish and was also having severe back pain. Being Omar, he was set on pushing on through two live shows and his three Sunday church service gigs. After the first-morning church service, Omar did not realize his body was beginning to shut down on him – he was still thinking the pain and flu-like symptoms were from a pinched nerve in his back. After getting home he laid down on the floor and literally did not get up for almost a full week - daily promising his brothers that he would be better soon. Omar was not getting better and towards the end of the week seemed to be acting strange – not like himself and not making sense when he spoke. David and Joseph had seen enough and called 911. Paramedics came to the house and took him by ambulance to the hospital. He was immediately admitted to ICU at Methodist Hospital downtown and was diagnosed with a mini-stroke and a staph infection that docs determined came from a sore on his back. On top of the infection and neurological damage - Omar has suffered kidney damage from the antibiotics and other meds. All of this trauma then caused his body to go into crisis mode and he began to retain fluids – which has put him in an incredibly dangerous and life-threatening situation. Many of you have been praying for Omar, his family and the doctors and nurses who have been doing all they can to save his life. The good news is those prayers are moving the hand of God and Omar is starting to make a turn for the better but he is still very far from being out of the woods. He is now on day 10 in the ICU at Methodist Hospital and will need to continue on the antibiotics to fight the staph infection. He will soon begin physical therapy to walk again and will soon have a complete life change needing to adhere to a strict diet which will provide improved long term health & healing. Omar – sadly like so many professional musicians in Memphis - has no health insurance. Even when he does get out of the hospital - he will continue to need meds and will be transferred to a live-in rehab facility. As I am sure you have already been thinking – his medical bills will be overwhelming! This is where we come in… please join us in helping Omar get back to doing what he loves and was born to do through his life and music - and that's to love, teach and serve so many here in Memphis.

All while fighting cancer and undergoing Chemo and raditaion, she was able to work full time. Only missing work for doctor appointments.Unfortunately, in December 2016, she recieved the news that the cancer was back and that it had spread. With really bad stomach pain, she was taken to the ER on December 22nd. On New Years Eve, she had to have an emergency surgery on her bowels. Since her surgrey, she has been in and out of ICU several times to ensure she was getting the best care possible. She spent 4 weeks in the hospital.On January 20th 2017, she was able to go home! Sadly, it didn't last long. After one week, she was taken back to ER where she spent another week in the hospital. Currently she is at a rehab center trying her hardest to get well enough to get home and to start Chemo once again.With all that being said, she is unable to work right now. And you guessed it. Those bills keep coming. If you are able to contribute to this fund to help her with medical and living expenses, it would be greatly appreciated. She truly is the hardest working, stongest woman you will ever meet. If we can help her by taking some financial burden off from her, she can focus on the only thing that is important, getting herself strong enough to come home and start chemo again!Read more"

As Grant and Gina were getting into their truck to head to Texas on Wednesday, June 24, 2020, they received word the race was cancelled due to COVID-19. Since the race was cancelled, Grant and his sister, Gwen, decided to meet at Gwen’s house a few days later and do a 200 mile bike ride in Colorado. (Their brother, Seth, planned to wait a couple miles away to join them for a portion of the ride.)On the morning of June 27, 2020, less than two miles into the bike ride, Grant was hit full force from behind by a vehicle. Gwen felt the vehicle swoosh past her and saw Grant get hit.We imagine the driver and his family also are going through a very difficult time. It cannot be easy for them.Fortunately, Gwen had EMT training and was able to keep Grant stable enough until Life Flight arrived to take him to the hospital. Seth also arrived on scene and gave much needed help. They are our heroes!From what we understand, Grant sustained several skull fractures, several compressed back fractures, two spinal fractures, a broken jaw, a broken hip and the list goes on and on. The worst injuries appear to be internal. He has a traumatic brain injury, including injury to his brain stem.Gina and Gwen in the Emergency RoomGina collapsing to the floor as Grant is wheeled awayDaughter visiting Grant in the ICULife Before the AccidentGrant married Gina, his best friend and childhood sweetheart, on June 22, 1996.

Their oldest daughter has worked for the company for a year as an apprentice. Grant has taught each of his children to always be working towards something new and challenging. If Grant was not learning a new piano piece or watching a documentary to expand his knowledge, you often would find him seeking a new certification for his business.In keeping with his belief never to be idle, Grant entered his first race, an Olympic distance Triathlon, in September 2007. He fell in love with training and racing. He then ran his first marathon in April 2009 in Salt Lake City, Utah. Since that time, he has raced in over 30 marathons, including four Pikes Peak marathons. He has completed eight full-length Ironman races and numerous 70.3 half-Ironman distance races. On August 19, 2017, he ran the Leadville 100 for his 40th birthday. He completed the race in 24 hours, 27 minutes, and 48 seconds!

Nevertheless, during that time, he continued to contradict the doctors and nurses who thought his brain stem was too severely compromised. Despite the dire predictions, Grant was able to regulate his sodium levels, his body temperature, etc. Although Grant continued moving up the Glasgow Coma Scale from a three to a seven (one being the lowest representing no response and 15 being the highest which is the goal), and despite his continued progress in other areas, the primary care neurologist and physician’s assistant offered little hope. On Friday, July 17, 2020, the two of them gave our sister the “withdrawal of care talk.” The PA actually told Gina that “She could have avoided being in this situation” meaning our sister should have denied care earlier. Thankfully, our sister closed the door on that negativity and refused to withdraw care.Four days later, Grant was accepted into and transferred to a transitional hospital/rehab facility. We are so grateful because the hospital allows Gina to visit him, even though the time is limited due to COVID-19. Grant continues to improve. He recently fought his way off the ventilator and the facility staff are working towards removing his trache. Transfer dayAfter the transitional hospital/rehab facility, the goal is for Grant to go to a high level neuro rehab and therapy facility to re-train his brain so he will learn again how to eat, talk, walk, etc. In order for him to be admitted, Grant needs to attain a higher level of consciousness.Once Grant achieves a certain level of progress at the present facility, he will be discharged. If Grant has not obtained the required level of consciousness, then he will need home health care until he “wakes up” enough for the neuro rehab and therapy facility.Grant and Gina at transitional hospital/rehab facilityGina and their two oldest children, who are both in their early 20’s, are working to keep the company’s current plumbing jobs on schedule while Grant is in a coma and his body continues to heal.Unfortunately for our sister and her family, the medical bills are starting to arrive. Grant and his family need your help! The medical bills for Grant’s care will be exorbitant and insurance will not cover everything. Gina currently is traveling three to four hours (round-trip) daily to visit and advocate for her husband. When he transfers to the higher rehab facility, his rehabilitation regimen will be more than six hours a day. Gina will rent an apartment or VRBO to stay close and be part of the rehabilitation process. Best outcomes are obtained when family members are part of the process and learn how to care for their loved one. Additionally, there also is concern about obtaining new plumbing projects and maintaining revenue from their business for their family and employees. Three of Grant and Gina’s kids are still in high school and living at home. We further anticipate the need for home modifications to help take care of Grant better when he returns home and works towards recovery. He and his family have a long road ahead. That said, we believe in miracles. We have seen so many already. Because of the prayers and faith of many on his behalf, we know we will see more! We look forward to the day when Grant runs his next race. Regardless of his time, it will be his best race ever!Read more"

My Sister, Jen, was not aware that I would be creating this account, but we have since talked and she is now aware. ❤ I appreciate your time in reading this and if you are in a position which provides you the ability and draw to bless others, we truly appreciate any help you could provide. My Sister's story: I've always been so incredibly blown away by my Sister's strength; she truly is the strongest person I know. I'll pick up the story starting in April, but know that the story doesn't start there. Within the past year, my Sister has experienced a few medical events, including a stroke last Fall, which have rendered her blind in her right eye as well as impacting her language center of her brain. She handled those events with humor and positivity throughout.The morning of April 11th, Jen awoke to what I consider one of the most horrific nightmares I can imagine; she had no feeling from her sternum-down. In the storm of a worldwide pandemic, she was taken to the hospital and allowed no visitors for weeks while her amazing medical team worked to figure out what happened and why. After those initial 2 weeks, she was transferred to a rehab facility where they continued to pursue a diagnosis, but also began the summit of rehabilitation. She was still allowed no visitors due to the pandemic, but on one day, she was at least able to hear her husband Shawn's voice when he dropped off a care package. She gushed to her therapists about just feeling a rush of relief even hearing his voice and knowing he was near her. The medical team commented on how much they could tell they loved each other just from that encounter. Shawn reassured her daily that everything would be okay; that he loved her and would carry her everywhere she needed to go if he needed to while caring for their 3.5 year old daughter, Brooklynn. He was her rock through it all during those weeks.On April 28th, Jen's Mom went to pick Brooklynn up to give Shawn some time to start preparing the house for Jen's homecoming in a few weeks. That day, the nightmare that had started just a few weeks prior turned to an absolute terror as she arrived to find that Shawn had passed away in his sleep during the night. My sister's husband, the love of her life, the father of her child, her protector and her rock... is gone. There just aren't words to describe the hurt I have in my heart for her. I cannot imagine what she is going through, none of it. Still, her therapists commented that she continued to work harder than any patient they have had on her recovery. She channeled her pain into a drive to get home to see her daughter. Though rehabilitation efforts have gotten her to a place where she can do some things independently, the chances that she will regain feeling or function below her sternum are very low (1-3%). Her function in her hands has also been impacted. Unable to even make a fist, her mobility is very challenging at this point. On June 4th, Jen was released from rehab into my Mom's care. She requires 24 hour care. At the moment, Jen will be staying at her and Shawn's house with my Mom. There are some thoughts that this may change if a townhouse becomes available near my Mom's. As of today, June 10th, there is no ramp for my Sister to get in and out of the house. She requires medical transport by ambulance if she needs to go to the hospital. The quotes received for a ramp thus far have been mind blowing. I'll reserve my comments on the prices of things meant to help those in need...Which brings me to the point of all of this. My sister does have some life insurance coming to her in the coming months, however her eyes welled up with tears yesterday as we discussed the fact that some of these essential items will start to deplete those funds quickly. She cried at the thought that these funds, which she wanted to primarily start education savings and savings accounts for Brooklynn's future, would be used for things for her instead. This. This is why I am posting this. What she needs:A temporary ramp for her house, a handicap accessible bathroom, a wheelchair (insurance will cover an electric one, but the financial burden of a manual one for when she leaves the house for therapies lies on her), transportation to and from therapies, medical co-pays, deductibles and medical needs not covered by insurance (I never knew how much WASN'T covered by insurance until now). I would also really love to have funds available for hiring an in home nurse for even short periods of time so my Mom can have a weekend to visit her grandchildren or just take a moment to breathe for herself. Eventually, she will need a permanent ramp for wherever she decides to reside as well as a chair lift if she is able to purchase a townhouse. Again, this fund is being established in response to those asking if one would be set up for her and if they could contribute. Please do not feel obligated and again, I thank you for your time reading this. ❤Read more"

The holidays are upon us and hopefully you & your family are getting ready to gear up for gift giving and the holiday spirit.It is not often I ask for help, but this weekend I found out a very dear friend (Barb Arnold) is in need of support. Barb is a friend that has bent over backwards to help people in need and now she needs help. Remember when I asked for a volunteer for a dental cleaning?? Well she is the person who was scared to death of the Dentist, but sat through exams and cleanings to help a college kid pass their state boards because I said my daughter was in need. This is a woman who has donated to people in need, with the mindset of “you never know when you might need help”. This is a woman who is desperate for help, but doesn’t want to ask anyone in order to not burden anyone else during the hectic holiday season.Now imagine this. You are an active family with 3 boys, twins age 11 and a 4 year old. The boys are growing like weeds and seem to outgrow their clothes overnight. Band and chorus rehearsals requires dress clothes, but your 11 year old has had another growth spurt and fits into nothing in the closet. You have to go buy him clothes for his rehearsal, but it seems there are not enough hours in a day. Mom works days, Dad works nights to ensure someone is always home with the kids. Days are crazy, kids are active in school, work is draining, and your 11 year old comes down with a fever and the flu. Dad had a scratch on his elbow. On a Thursday night, Dad says my elbow really hurts and has a fever. You both “write it off” as he is coming down with the FLU bug your son has.Friday morning, Dad still has a fever but now his arm is red, sore and has blisters. You call the Doctor insisting your husband needs to be seen today and make an appointment. You have that “feeling in your gut” something isn’t right. Doctor sends you to the hospital and life begins to swirl into a nightmare. Doctor says Dad has necrotizing fasciitis (aka flesh eating disease) and needs to be put in isolation. Your heart stops and you can’t believe what you are hearing. Doctor says surgery is needed asap to stop the infection, but you have the kids in school and are out of time off at work. How can this be happening?It is now a week later. Dad has had 4 surgeries to date. Dad is out of isolation, but still in a touch & go status. The last surgery was from wrist to armpit to open up the arm and leave the wound open to try and stop the infection from spreading. Dad is in pain, but putting on a strong face. The Doctors have scheduled yet another surgery to put in a drain for Wednesday. Dad is now in the hospital almost 2 weeks and there is no talk of a release date.Mom is trying to remain positive. There is no time for breaking down when your kids are looking at you in fear. Mom knows it is time to figure out what is happening today. Keep a smile on, stay calm and positive everything will work out, but will there be an urgent call from the hospital saying your husband needs another surgery? Can the Doctors save your husband’s right arm? Do you go to work trying to save time for when you “really” need to be home? Do you keep the kids going to school for a distraction? How do you answer the boys questions and ease their fears when you don’t have any real answers? Now throw in what to cook for dinner, when is there time to clean, do the laundry (remember those darn growth spurts?? The boys only fit into certain clothes in the closet), figure out daycare and how to get the older boys on and off the school bus, homework, the boys wanting to visit Dad at the hospital, praying another call is not received saying her husband needs another emergency surgery, wondering how to keep a happy face and plan the holidays. There is too much to do, no time to stop moving, now throw in Thanksgiving is weeks away, and then there is Christmas – how do they keep life “normal” for 3 boys who still believe in Santa?My head is spinning and I am not living this nightmare. I can only think that the best way to help my friend, Barb, and her family that is in desperate need, is financially. Insurance only covers 80% of the hospital stay, and they are already on day 9 with no talk of a release date. Who knows how much the surgeries are going to wind up costing. There will be medicine and rehab after he is finally released. A two income family is immediately down to a one income family and no one knows for how long. I know this is much bigger than a simple donation from me. Normally I try to donate during this time of year to strangers who are in need. I have sent gifts to kids from the Walmart tree before. I have been an angel for a child on a church tree. This year my focus will be on my girlfriend and her boys. I have set this “go fund me” up to ask my family, friends and neighbors to join with me and please consider donating to Barb and her family - to give her a little piece of PEACE during this trying time. The battle is going to be a long hard road that won't be over after the holidays, but maybe as a community we can help a family get through these days with a tiny bit less stress. Any donation will help, as Barb has said in the past, you never know when you might need help yourself.Wishing everyone the best during this holiday season.Remember - be a change in this world.

While Terry, Maggie, Nate, and Mike understood the surgery's complexity, they never expected just how complicated, heartbreaking, and long recovery would be.The reality is Terry is a complex neurology patient with extensive and complex needs. Maggie recently shared, ""Our reality has been a difficult one, and that is an understatement. Dad cannot walk, use a toilet, and is still on a g-tube for feedings. Dad struggles with being cognitively coherent every moment of every day. Dad is still, only briefly ever with us. Dad is a Traumatic Brain Injury Patient with significant impairments.""Maggie, Nate, and Mike are doing their best to find a rehab facility that meets Terry's complex neurological needs. They methodically work through a list of Neurorehabilitation facilities and continue to receive rejections due to Terry's complex medical conditions or the facility not being in the network for his insurance.There are so few options and many unknowns in Terry's future right now. The limited options come with significant expense and sacrifice. Although Terry has health insurance, it's proving to be a barrier to his recovery. His insurance continues to provide obstacles in his treatment options and will not cover all of his medical expenses. Expenses continue to accumulate, and options dwindle while the family desperately searches for alternatives.Funds raised will be used to cover an anticipated stay at a long-term neurological rehabilitation facility, any related medical costs, and the potential for temporary housing for a family member.As treatment centers' options continue to dwindle, Maggie, Nate, and Mike continue to widen their search. They are weary, hopeful, and are seeking a miracle for their father. They are fierce advocates and love Terry dearly. Chances are, if you are here, you do too. Terry and his family need our help because the dad and papa they know and love needs assistance beyond what they ever could have imagined. Over the years, they've supported so many of us near and far.

First, and foremost, let’s talk about Sean. Sean is a loving father to Jake, 12, and Abbey, 9. He married the love of his life, Kelly, in January 2006. They have lived in Arizona, Houston, and now Utah while Sean fulfilled his dream of becoming a pilot. He recently got a job with Delta in 2017 where he was just at the begining of his career.He loves traveling, working out, the outdoors, but most importantly his family.Sean was in an accident Monday August 17th on the North Ogden Dividearound 6:30in the evening. He suffered life threatening injuries and blood loss.He was treated on scene and transported by Lifeflight to Ogden Regional Medical Center where he was stabilized and eventually transported to the University of Utah hospital.The injuries have been severe and unfortunately, the list has grown over the last 11 days:L leg:-Compound ""floating knee"" broken femur, -broken tib/fib-Crushed footR leg:-Fractured footJaw:-Broken everywhere, open laceration from ear to ear-Pressure from this causing ear drainage-4 strokes (fat emboli from broken long bones)-temporal skull fracture-bruised spinal cord-cracked vertebrae-torn carotid arterySean has been in a coma and come to increasingly hopeful levels of awareness while they let his body heal and gauge the severity of neurological status.Now let’s talk about Kelly...Kelly worked full time as an English teacher in Houston (and earned two Master’s degrees they paid cash for) plus held down the house and kids through heat and hurricanes while supporting the six figure student loan debt Sean’s education and pilot training incurred. . .And they finally paid them off and in 2017 were able to purchase their home in Utah and move from Houston closer to their dream and families.Kelly has worked part time teaching and freelance writing/editing the past year and a half here and recently went to full time teaching and signed a contract for her formerly freelance job. . .While they don’t know what Sean’s medical and recovery needs will be long term, it isn’t the future financial path so much as the sheer magnitude of the bills they are going to owe 20% of now 20% of the types of neuro, ortho, surgical, and so many other bills is still a harrowing figure that may rival the six figure debt they once tackled so determinedly before.Any help we can give/donate will hopefully ease some of the financial burden and stress on his wife and wingman, Kelly and ultimately their whole sweet family. She will continue to balance missing work to be by Sean’s side and keep the kids happy, healthy, and active while also trying to support them financially. Any one who knows either of them knows that they are careful planners and hard workers— this isn’t a lack of preparation or irresponsibility but such bad, sad circumstances.Progress and updates are atwww.caringbridge.org/visit/updatesonSeanCWe have also set up a charitable account at America first credit union.

My beautiful baby was savagely attacked by another dog while we were walking to my daughters football match in Derby’s Racecourse Park.

She was attacked by a classic bully dog. This dog has not had the best upbringing, probably has suffered abused and has been taught to hurt by its owners, my gentle girl had no chance against her attacker. She needed a blood transfusion and has undergone multiple procedures for the reconstruction of her leg and muscles. 

Pride Veterinary in Derby saved her life and we will be forever grateful!!

While all of this was unfolding the owner of this dog (a white male in his early 20s) threaten my daughters father with a knife, he sustained a serious cut to his hand and has undergone tendon repair surgery.

This was all witnessed by my ten year old daughter who is now distraught and traumatised by this experience. No child should ever watch their best friend being torn to pieces and her father being threaten with a knife!

The police have launched an investigation and are looking for those responsible.The owners of this dog ran away while my loving girl bled in my arms and my daughter cried in distress.

We have pet insurance, however Emma has needed specialist procedures and 1:1 care. Emma will need further rehabilitation that will not be covered by the insurance company and the unexpected funds are not available to us at the moment. 

A little bit about Emma: Emma is a Lagotto Romagnolo. She adopted us! she came from Romania, where she was abused and beaten by her previous owners. We worked hard to earn her trust and socialise her enough for her to trust humans and dogs again. She is such a good girl and she did not deserve any of this, no dog should ever have to go through this much pain.

Unfortunately, we fear that this episode will be a set back and that’s why we would love to be able to offer her the best possible rehabilitation, not only for her physical injuries but most importantly to help her overcome this traumatic experience with a professional behaviouralist.Anything you can donate will be very much appreciated, Emma has not had the best start in life and all we ever wanted was to love her and give her the best life possible.

She is our family's first fur baby. Stormy is a Blue Tri American Bully, a canine from the Bully breed she part Pitbull and part Staffordshire Terrier. Stormy is a sweet puppy who loves to run and play, always wants a good belly rub and as Aubrey says, ""has a really great sniffer"". On 3/6 Stormy experienced a sharp decline in health and over the course of one week was unable to walk or stand. She is currently hospitalized at Pieper Veterinary Hospital, an emergency and specialty animal hospital in Middletown, CT. On Saturday March 6th, Stormy began displaying symptoms of extreme lethargy and slowed movements. Her progression over the following 7 days resulted in three emergency visits to the ER. On 3/13 Stormy lost her ability to walk and stand and was admitted as a critical patient to Pieper's ER unit. Stormy has since been diagnosed with a neurological paralysis as the result of an infection in her cervical spine. An MRI scan on 3/15 revealed Stormy has a significant amount of inflammation, fluid and a small amount of hemorrhaging around her cervical spine and close to her brain stem. Root-cause is either due to inflammatory disease, such as meningitis or a bacterial infection. With Stormy experiencing a neurological paralysis she is unable to put much weight on her back legs, no weight on her front legs and cannot stand or walk unassisted. She is experiencing feeling in both front limbs which is a positive sign. Stormy's Neurologist has recommended an ongoing treatment of steroid and antibiotic medication. Stormy will have to remain in hospitalized while Pieper's neurology team evaluates her progress over the coming days. With signs of increased strength Stormy can be discharged home. At home treatment will consist of continued use of oral medications (over the next 4 months) and ongoing physical therapy to help with nerve regeneration and over time, hopefully regaining full function of her front and back limbs. Without improvement a biopsy of her cervical spine tissue will be necessary to determine a more appropriate treatment. As surgery is the more aggressive option we are hoping that her current treatment plan proves successful.As you can imagine vet bills can skyrocket, especially when you are treating a highly uncommon health issue in your animal. We've had to leave a hefty deposit to begin the process of helping Stormy so we are hoping to help raise additional funds through her Go Fund Me. Her road to recovery will be long and will require the use of long-term steroid and antibiotic medication as well as rehabilitation therapy. Stormy is a young puppy so we are hoping to give her a chance to enjoy her best dog life. Any contribution is extremely appreciated! We will keep donors updated on Stormy's progress through Go Fund Me notifications. Please help save our sweet girl.p.s. Aubrey is Stormy's 10-year old human sister :)Gratefully,xoxoRead more"

Donna has always been one of those kind of people we always hope that we can be like. Perfect in every way. On Christmas Eve, Don's was dealt a terrible blow. Just after finishing wrapping up Christmas presents for her & Seans gorgeous boys, Huxley (2.5 years) and Reeve (4 months ) our beautiful Donna suffered a horrendous seizure. With Sean by her side Donna was rushed to Frankston Hospital where a CT was performed, this is when they were told the horrific news that she had a golf ball sized brain tumour in the right side of her frontal lobe. To continue speacialist care, Donna was transferred to The Alfred Hospital in Melbourne where further tests and investigations were performed. An MRI showed that along with the tumour there was also a cyst which needed immediate surgery to release pressure in her brain and to prevent further debilitating seizures. Unfortunately due to the busy holiday period and the public system running on skeleton staff, surgery was being cancelled day after day after day. With Donna & Sean, their boys and family living on the Mornington Peninsula an hour and a half away, waiting for an unknown amount of time for surgery to take place was not an option.Donna was transferred to St Vincent's Private Hospital under the expert care of Neurosurgeon Dr Peter McNeil. On the 4th January 2017 Donna had major brain surgery to remove the cyst and debulk as much of the tumour that was deemed safe. The following day, Dr Peter McNeil and his team informed Donna, Sean and family that the tumour was an astrocytoma. So far, she has made an incredible recovery but the fight is unfortunately not over. Continuing treatment will be required, starting with intensive radiation to radiate any remaining tumour. Further treatment will be determined after this. After 16 gruelling days in Hospital away from her beautiful boys, brain surgery, recovery and dealing with the unknown on the 9th January 2017 Donna is finally set to head home. Although this is a huge relief for Donna and her family, recovery means 6 weeks of no bending over, no lifting, no exertion... for those of you who know Donna, you'll know that this amazing mother/wife/daughter/sister/friend of ours.... finds it very hard to sit still. But she has to. ￼￼￼￼￼With a toddler and an infant this is going to be so hard for our devoted, caring, loving, hardworking Don. There's also a 6 month driving ban been put in place by her neurosurgeon as a safety measure, until there is no evidence of further seizures.Donna, Sean & family have been dealt this enormously unfair blow at the most unfair time of year, their first Christmas with their two beautiful boys. Donna is going to need to familiarise herself and their home with tools and equipment that is going to make her recovery as easy and stress free as possible. This is where I ask if you have a dollar or two to spare to help this incredible girl on her road to recovery please donate to help her road to recovery all the more easier. Funds raised will go towards medical expenses, travel costs, rehab equipment, groceries, home help and any other expenses they are to be faced with during this time. Any money that is raised and not needed will be donated to their chosen foundation.Thank you in advance from the bottom of our hearts , your messages of support, encouragement, flowers, offers of help etc have been nothing short of mind blowing.

Meet Jace Blue. He is an amazing baseball player and avid golfer. His drive and passion have built him into the athlete he is today. Jace loves Jesus, his family, and his friends. He loves to joke around and always jumps at the opportunity to make others laugh! Jace is also very smart. He is an eighth grader at CCMS, a member of Jr. Beta, and a student at The Gateway Academy for gifted students.  On Halloween weekend, Jace was in Memphis, TN for a travel baseball tournament. While in Memphis, he suffered from a severe asthma attack, which ultimately lead to cardiac arrest. This happened twice in a very short time frame. He was transferred to LeBohneur Children's Hospital. After a short period of time, Jace began to show signs of improvement. About three days into what we thought was the beginning of his recovery, he started to rapidly decrease.  It started with large body spasms to where he is now in his current state- major vision impairment, fine and gross motor skills extremely limited, and very minimal communication skills. We are praising God for protecting Jace’s cognitive abilities through this because they seem to be completely intact. With COVID cases rising, hospitals only allow one parent to be with him for the entirety of his stay at Shepherd. This could be anywhere from 2 to 6 months. Jace’s family members have been traveling in every chance they get just to see him through a fence for a few hours at a time, offering whatever support they can and to give him some sort of family interaction.  So, everyone has been asking, ""What can we do to help? What do they need?"" We are creating this account just for that! It’s a place where family and friends can love on them in their time of need from afar. Any and all funds will go towards traveling expenses, hotel stays, meals, upcoming medical bills, and care for Jace post rehab.  If you feel so inclined you can give a gift to the family here. Above all else though, they ask for your prayers for Jace. Continue to pray with them in agreement that Jace will be completely healed. They also wanted to take the opportunity to thank everyone from the bottom of their hearts for the outpouring of love and kindness they have already received. Thank you, and God Bless!

It was touch-and-go for some time until we knew what the extent of the damage was, but Vic being Vic, she surprised us all and pulled through the surgery. The thought of losing her was just too much to bear.Victoria spent three weeks at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, was then transferred to the Stroke Unit at High Wycombe Hospital for another few weeks, and is now undergoing extensive rehab at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre in Oxford until she (hopefully) gets to return home in April.Suffice to say, it’s a miracle that she has come this far in the past four months, as the bleed was huge and caused total paralysis of the left side of her body. She continues to surprise us all with her progress, but the long-term reality is that Victoria has a severe disability, both mentally and physically, meaning that she will probably never work again and will take quite some time to regain the ability to walk.Once Victoria does return home (and this day can’t come soon enough!) the bottom line is that our house needs to be totally ‘Vic-proofed’ with stair lifts, handrails, re-organisation of rooms so our bedroom will be on the ground floor, and changing of the front drive so that Vic can get in and out in a wheelchair. I just want to try and create a home that makes it possible for Victoria to lead as ‘normal’ a life as possible.Asking for money is really uncomfortable, but the truth of the matter is that private health doesn’t cover the majority of our needs going forward, and the brilliant NHS can only go so far with after-care, of which we are looking at tens of thousands of pounds for the foreseeable future. As anyone who has ever had the pleasure to know Victoria, she is the most selfless person who always cares so deeply about everyone and has always been the first to fundraise for various causes close to her heart; running, swimming, cycling and climbing mountains to raise money for many people. And the children in India and Thailand at the various orphanages she volunteered at were definitely the richer for her English teaching skills.So what I really want to ask is, would you consider donating so that we can buy this amazing wheelchair for Victoria? It’s not your standard run-of-the-mill chair, but an all-terrain motorised vehicle that will enable Vic to join me on dog walks with the loves of her life – Brutus and Lulu - something she absolutely lives for, and to provide her with some normality with the ability to get outside and enjoy her life as much as she is able.https://trekinetic.com/power/If we could raise enough money to buy this chair I would be so incredibly grateful. You really have no idea how much it would mean to Victoria and myself.Thank you.Olly.Read more"

For those of you that knew Jr, you most likely remember his spunky, charismatic personality. There wasn’t a situation, event, or time that he didn’t crack a joke. From his goofy fun loving personality, to his love of making people laugh, his heart is what stood out the most.

From helping to deliver food to the needy with our mothers church to sending random messages “just to see how your doing”..... he wanted to help. He wanted to love and he wanted to be loved.

On April 30th my brother was involved as a passenger in a single vehicle crash. He was air cared to UC where they worked tirelessly to save his life for 13 days. Within the 1st week he endured several surgeries to fix what seemed like his entire body.

While we knew his condition was critical & his injuries were extensive, we were hopeful they would put him back together & even discussed the rehab he would need to continue once he was released.

On Sunday May 10th Jr took an unexpected turn for the worst.... one we didn’t see coming. His organs began to fail and everything turned into a whirlwind for my family.

In the span of 2 days we went from giving Jr a day of rest to withdrawing support. My family & I were shocked... completely devastated.

On May 12th at approximately 1:36 PM with myself and my mother at his bedside, Jr went home & was freed of all the earthly struggles he faced duringhis short life.

We are asking for donations to give my brother a proper burial. A burial that will help my parents obtain a tiny bit of closure. A burial that he deserves.

Any & every amount is greatly appreciated & will go directly to his burial expenses.

If you are unable to donate, all prayers are welcomed and appreciated, especially for my parents.

Please help us share this as far & wide as possible because he deserves to be laid to rest & find the peace he has searched for, for so long.

Within a few days he was taken to Maine Med in Portland to undergo surgery to remove the clot from his brain. The surgery was not successful and they were unable to reverse any damage that had been done due to the stroke. He is currently in rehab at New England Rehab in Portland where he is undergoing intensive physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy for many hours a day. Alan has a long road ahead of him but he is a strong and determined man that is the hardest worker, and will overcome the challenges with the support of all of us. As you can assume, during this time the medical bills are mounting and with the inability for Alan to work right now, financial strain is burdening this already tragic situation.We are lucky to live in a community that constantly pulls together in times of need and Alan needs us now more than ever.

Thank you for visiting our page. We are the Walls family.10/23/20 Update - Since the last update Mike continued on chemo treatment for control of the existing cancer understanding this is the new normal. Cancer @#$% Sucks!Mike had been experiencing leg pain back in November 2019, but nothing significant showed on repeated scans even up to a week before the fall. The pain was so bad he started to use crutches. On May 24th, Mike left his bathroom for bed and gracefully fell onto his left hip with a complete break between the trochanter (ball joint) and femur. He was saved by Alexa calling his son Jake whom called 911. Emergency surgery was preformed at OSF.After release Mike joined the Street Rehab until Mid-August and was later transferred to the Walls Rehab. The pain continued to increase along with the meds with no continued relief. Mike has been off chemo treatment for 5 months and there has been no healing of the bone. Radiation treatment was recommended however this would cause the leg to never heal. This was not an acceptable option. It was decided to contact the super team at Mayo who saved him once before.His Mayo Oncologist immediately reached out to Radiation Oncology and Surgical Orthopedic Oncology for consult. A Mayo surgeon called immediately and said ""stop"". ""Can you get him here on up here on Monday he will never heal, he needs a major surgery "". We had multiple phone calls and a video visit and on our way we went. Due to lack of time and insurance untimely processing (shocker), Mike was transported via the Street Med Transport Service, charges and bribery pending.This week we have met with his care team and he is approved for surgery on Monday. There is a large tumor from hip to knee which is more extensive than his scan from September in comparison. Mike will be having the biggest surgery done in Mayo's Orthopedic Oncology department by removing all the tumor from hip to knee if possible and a full replacement. There will be an entire surgical team from many areas involved in his surgery. This will be 8-10 hours. The biggest complication after surgery is infection so he will be admitted for 5-7 days post surgery. Coolest frickin' part, he will actually be weight bearing next day...whoa! He will have a brace for up to 5 months but wow.....from never walk again to next day. Magic Mike is coming back!The palliative care team is doing their best to keep him drugged until Monday. Please reach out with any well wishes and as much sarcasm as possible. Video calls, texts, pics.....etc. Mike is now on long term disability, still hoping to return to work in the near future with Integrity Technology. We have accepted there is no cure, quality of life is #1.If you are unable to donate monetarily we would appreciate a kind thought, prayer, or just a phone, video call, or text to say “Hi.” We are so grateful to everyone who continues to support Mike. Thank you!Mike's Full Cancer Story:June 2015 Mike Walls, 47, went to the ER for abdominal pain and severe bloating. We thought he hit the jackpot (first male to give birth)! Instead an appendectomy was completed but provided no relief. A 2nd surgery was then performed to remove a suspicious mass in the colon. Biopsy of the mass was confirmed to be cancer. Mike then endured 6 months of chemo treatment and named himself Chemo Mike, which he does not recommend as a weight loss program. He continued to be monitored with no change.January 2018 Mike returned to surgery for the removal of a lower right abdominal mass. It was later confirmed by Northwestern to be drop cell cancer.January 2019 The mass returned in the right portion of his abdomen. After consulting with Northwestern and it was determined by Mike and his family to consult with Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.April 17, 2019Imaging was conducted at Mayo which revealed additional nodules in both lungs. The following week Mike was taken to the ER for a severe headache. Subsequent imaging revealed a large tumor in his brain which required immediate surgery. Mayo was contacted and flew in that evening with their medical transport team. By the next morning he had undergone a right suboccipital craniectomy and removal of the tumor was successful. He asked the neurosurgeon if he would be a better guitar player now.... this is yet to be determined.Mike, now 51, is home recovering and is scheduled to return to the Mayo Clinic on May 14th for further testing, consultation and ongoing treatment. Radiation of the brain and many months of chemo are expected.AUGUST 6, 2019After a long two days consulting with Mayo has decided to send Mike back to three more cycles of chemo. The brain looked good post surgery. The abdominal wall, adrenal gland and lung areas have reduced in size which shows he is responding to chemo. This is good news, however they feel more time is needed to monitor the brain.When Mike returns in 3 months they will rescan, consult and then send his case to the Mayo tumor board for review. His team states there is minimal data on colon cancer spread to the brain. Mayo plans to be aggressive in treatment due to his young age, while also being cautious.Mike, in his free time, joined a clinical trial for genetic testing on 85 genes related to cancer. There is only a small chance of a genetic mutation, however that could change the course of treatment in the future.September 2018Mike's cancer was found to have metastasized to his adrenal gland and the right abdominal mass had returned. Chemo Mike returned, deciding to try the mediport this round but he developed multiple blood clots and had it removed immediately. He continued chemo intravenously and was showing some response to treatment.April 17, 2019Imaging was conducted at Mayo which revealed additional nodules in both lungs. The following week Mike was taken to the ER for a severe headache. Subsequent imaging revealed a large tumor in his brain which required immediate surgery. Mayo was contacted and flew in that evening with their medical transport team. By the next morning he had undergone a right suboccipital craniectomy and removal of the tumor was successful. He asked the neurosurgeon if he would be a better guitar player now.... this is yet to be determined.MAY 15, 2019This weeks Mayo visit with Oncology went well. Additional MRI images of the full spine showed no cancer in the brain which is a WIN we are very happy with. Brain radiation will start Monday. Following will be several months of chemo before returning to Mayo for further consults on existing cancer.MAY 22, 2019Today was Mike’s final brain radiation treatment at Mayo was able to ring the bell. Treatment continues Friday, with the return of Chemo Mike for a couple months before returning to re-evaluate.  AUGUST 6, 2019Mayo has decided to send Mike back to three more cycles of chemo. The brain looked good post surgery. The abdominal wall, adrenal gland and lung areas have reduced in size which shows he is responding to chemo. This is good news, however they feel more time is needed to monitor the brain.When Mike returns in 3 months they will rescan, consult and then send his case to the Mayo tumor board for review.

Mayo plans to be aggressive in treatment due to his young age, while also being cautious.Mike, in his free time, joined a clinical trial for genetic testing on 85 genes related to cancer. He tested negative which is good news for his family.DECEMBER 14, 2019Sorry to say we haven’t had any great news to post. Mike's case for surgical resection of cancer was denied by the tumor board. Unfortunately this leaves him with chemo as the only option. Yesterday he started chemo and received a call from MD Anderson in Houston. They will be reviewing his records this week.FEBRUARY 2020Evaluation at MD Anderson in Houston gave the same recommendation as Mayo. Continue chemo Mike until he no longer responds to this treatment. Super sad day. Chemo Mike continues.Read more"

It started with a cough that continued for a few months. After my diagnosis I was told that my heart failure was significant and I'd eventually need a heart transplant. Changing my diet and lifestyle helped for awhile but in 2011 I once again began to decline. By summer of 2013 I was bedridden and my cardiologist referred me to the center for transplant and assist devices at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn. In October of 2013 my new cardiologist told me that I was in end stage heart failure and would likely not make to Christmas unless I had an LVAD placed. By the end of October, I was prepped for surgery and my LVAD was placed on October 24. Recovery was long but in the months that followed with cardiac rehab I began to flourish and get back to doing daily tasks that were once impossible. In 2015 I was put on the heart transplant list. I've been on the list since 2015. The costs to maintain my LVAD are staggering with prescriptions and endless doctor and clinic visits. Being on the list for 4 plus years has taken it's toll physically and mentally and the costs post transplant are also going to be staggering. Medicare covers 80 percent which leaves me with the 20 percent to pick up. The cost of the LVAD so far has been around $725,000.00. The transplant will be on average upwards of 1.4 million. I'm reaching out for help with these costs as Social Security Disability and Medicare are barely scratching the surface of these expenses. The pay to play healthcare system in my opinion has kept me on the list for over 4 years. I would like the opportunity to survive and flourish in life just like anyone else.

I met Christine shortly after I moved to Providence eight years ago and she has been a generous and nurturing friend to me and so many others in her years here. On October 8, Christine’s husband Chris suffered a stroke and is still undergoing rehabilitation. While his cognitive function is good, and his speech is deliberate but clear, he still has lingering weakness/paralysis on the right side of his body and is undergoing intensive rehabilitation.Christopher is a talented furniture designer and a faculty member at Rhode Island School of Design. But because he is not categorized as a full-time faculty member this semester, his salary has been discontinued. He is eligibility for long-term disability, but it will only be 60% of his salary and it has not yet started to kick in.Christine is originally from Australia and Christopher from England. They have lived in Providence on and off for 30 years, with a few sabbaticals in Australia. Because they are not US citizens (since their children and their eventual retirement destination are overseas), Christine cannot work for pay (visa limitations) and they have reduced access to the social safety nets provided by U.S. government assistance.The two Chrises have a son in Australia and a daughter in Scotland. Their daughter in Scotland is the mother of three tiny children—including newborn twins. So their children are too far away or too busy to provide the kind of support nearby family could do.I suggested this fundraiser to Christine as a way to help them cope with some of the short-term expenses they have until they know better what Christopher’s long-term prognosis is, and then what their eventual plans will be.Christine hopes that you can help defray the following costs for them:3 months of expenses (insurance, taxes, utilities, food),                         $9,000Medical expenses not covered by insurance (ambulance, rehab, urgent care) $2,800Home equipment adaptations (wheelchair, hand rails, grab bars, shower chair) $800Miscellaneous expenses (Paypal fees, etc.)                                         $400While every penny would be helpful, we were reluctant to set the overall goal too high for fear of discouraging donors. If the goal is quickly met, we will raise the goal to help extend the safety net to help make up for the 40% shortfall in salary once disability payments kick in.If you know either of the Chrises, you know what a wonderful presence they have been in Providence over the years, as teachers, friends, and mentors. We hope you will donate what you can (no amount is too small) and please share the link on social media and via email to those you think might also be motivated to give.If you share, please add a personal note explaining how you know the Roses or me, and please use the hashtag #thetwochrises if possible.Thank you, bless you, and please be generous!Read more"

Clay St., Hinsdale, IL 60521----------------------------------------Darlyn Marie was known online as @absolutelydarling, so fitting because she was absolutely the darling of our family. Her kindness, bright smile, and laughter was contagious. She cared so much for others, often putting herself and her own needs to the side to support and help her friends and family first. When she did put herself first, she treated herself to food adventures, journaling and many shades of red lipstick.Darlyn loved her job at Apple, and was able to work from home during the pandemic. While working from home, she was determined to prioritize her health to best manage her diabetes and she spent her free time reading books, listening to music and sharing her love of baking with her goddaughter, Isabella Rae. She took every care and precaution to stay safe, healthy and enjoy time at home with her family.On December 13, Darlyn Marie was admitted to the emergency room for trouble breathing. She was confirmed Covid positive, along with others in her household. While the others stayed home to recover, Darlyn remained in the hospital and within a few short days of admission, she was moved to the ICU and placed on a ventilator.There were moments of great scare, like when we were told she would need round the clock dialysis. And there were moments of great hope, like when she came off the ventilator, received a tracheotomy and was transferred to a long-term rehab facility to start physical therapy.At the rehab facility, a few family members were able to video chat with her. While she was unable to speak to us, we could tell her how much we loved her and we asked her to fight hard. She could hear our voices rooting her on and telling her to stay strong. There were moments when she blinked for us, nodded her head in recognition and managed to put a smile on her face. On January 20, her heart stopped twice and was brought back twice. Our family stood on edge praying for her recovery, but we lost our beloved Darlyn Marie that day. Only nine days shy of her 33rd birthday. We wish terribly that we could have been by her side as she let go her last breath.It gives us comfort to imagine what it was like for Darlyn to be greeted by her mom and loved ones who passed before her. We imagine the comfort and eternal rest she must feel. While we mourn her passing, we will memorialize her sweetness and compassion.

On the morning of Sunday, October 30th, 2016, our friend & family member Sue Hagedorn, and her husband Jeff, experienced this horrific situation. Sue was the one on the floor… Jeff immediately called 911. His call and the quick action of first responders was key to keeping her alive. She was taken to Memorial Hospital in Jasper, stabilized and immediately medevacked to the Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit at the University of Louisville Hospital. After arriving in Louisville, Jeff and family were informed that she would need to have a hole drilled into her head and a drain put in place to clear the excess pressure from the blood to save her life. Following the procedure she was stabilized and moved upstairs to the Neuroscience ICU... that's where the family learned that Sue had suffered a stroke (a subarachnoid hemorrhage) due to a brain bleed near her brain stem.  These first few weeks have been frightening... not knowing if she would even survive, much less return to her old self. She was heavily sedated, on a ventilator, on dozens ofdifferent medications, and endured multiple procedures in attempt to identify the cause of the bleed and verify if it had stopped. We have watched her progress improve. First in the Neuroscience ICU, and we hope soon at The Frazier Rehab Institute and Neuroscience Center... but she still has quite a way to go. We have repeatedly been told thiswill bea marathon, measured in months, not in days or weeks, and we should pace ourselves accordingly.Unfortunately, her bills are starting to pile up. Even though she is medically insured, it's far from 100%, and we've heard that the total cost associated with these types of strokes, and their recovery,will likely grow exponentially. With her total out-of-pocket expenses remaining unknown to us at this time, we are asking for your support in her continued recovery. This is where you come in! First, pray. Second, give. Third, spread the word. Any help you could provide towards Sue's surgery and rehabilitation expenses would be much appreciated. Some will donate less, some will donate more, but every single dollar counts!  Regardless of how much you can afford to help, we really hope that all of her friends, family and co-workers decide to be a part of her recovery and follow her journey through updates that will be posted to this GoFundMe page.As most of you know, Sue is employed as a Purchasing Coordinator at Kimball Hospitality in Jasper, Indiana.

In the last two years, him and his family have been trying to find options to help him get better. After many doctor visits, his only option was to get a lung transplant. In January of this year he came to St. Louis and was approved by the hospital and Doctors for the procedure. His son, Chaz Hennecke came from California to Texas to help his Father and his sister Katie Hennecke to get Robert ready to move to St. Louis. In May, Robert and Chaz finalized the move and Chaz became is primary care giver. He seemed to be on the right track with his Pulmonary rehab, was making great progress and got on the lung transplant list. Unfortunately, on Friday July 7th Robert had a heart attack and was placed on life support. He's had multiple organ damage with some organs shutting down. He has now been taken off the transplant list and Doctors cannot proceed because of his organ failure. Robert had no plans to pass away and left no Will or ways to pay in the case that he would pass away. It has really put his children in a hard place emotionally and financially. I know it would mean so much if anyone could help them get some of this burden off their shoulders and be able to give their Father a respectable service.Read more"

To rectify this, graphic artist Nancy Waller and I are addressing this omission with a book about a little-known project of Sammy Davis, jr.  We planned to announce our effort on Patreon for some much-needed funding, given those days of healthy book advances are long gone.   Unfortunately, however, our progress was halted by a letter from the city of Hamden. It was a request for $15,407.75 in back taxes. If this sum isn’t paid, I lose my house.As much as I’d rather drum up support for the graphic-novel I want to complete with Nancy, I’m reluctant to exhaust my supporters' generosity by making this go-fund-me appeal but I have no choice under the circumstances. The situation with my house, which I own with my sister, is far more complicated than the $15,407.75 in back taxes.My name is Darius James. I am the author of three books: ""Negrophobia"", ""Voodoo Stew"" and ""Froggie Chocolates’ Christmas’ Eve"". I also co-wrote and narrated the travelogue The United States of Hoodoo, a glimpse into the spiritual life of diasporic African religions in North America. And I co-wrote and collaborated on the satiric feature film ""Sammy-Gate"" with film-maker Noel Lawrence. Currently, I am working on the aforementioned project with Nancy Waller and an adaptation of Ishmael Reed’s short story ""Cab Calloway Stands In For The Moon"" as my next film project with Noel.My house is a duplex. It’s fully paid for. My sister and I inherited the property after my father died in 2007. I rent the other half of the duplex for one thousand dollars a month. This is my primary source of income.The house I grew up in is located in an area blighted by industrial contamination.  Beginning in 1915, the neighborhood was the dumping ground of an old munitions factory. The company renowned for manufacturing the rifle responsible for the genocidal extermination of this country’s indigenous population used the area to dump tons of coke-ash. A map of the time shows thirteen designated dumps, both public and industrial. The town acquired a dump from the rifle factory in 1950 and opened a junior high school on the site six years later. It was noted that the former dump had not been covered with “adequate dirt.” Eventually, the thirteen dumps were land-filled, houses were built and, to quote the late Root-Boy Slim--”Yikes! Here come the Negros!”The history of my neighborhood is far more disgusting than I’m describing here--one hundred and forty years worth of disgusting. It was a malaria-carrying, mosquito-breeding marshland in the late eighteen hundreds. Later, the area was infested with mobs of rats.  A local newspaper once quoted the Hamden Health Director as saying the dumps were in “deplorable condition”.This wasn’t common knowledge to neighborhood residents until Hurricane Floyd ripped through in 1999, and tore up the top soil on the junior high-school grounds, exposing decades of contamination build-up. Several generations of school children were exposed to this toxicity. It’s wonder this area didn’t breed successive hordes of knuckle-dragging Garbage-Pail-Kids. Neighbors contracted cancer. In fact, this disease took my mother at the age of forty-two Hamden, by the way, is also noted for welcoming the industrial age. Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin only a few blocks from here, putting quite a few cotton-pickers out of work.This information is included -- not out of any sense of civic duty, as this appeal is solely for my benefit (and my sister’s) -- to provide a context for the financial web I find myself entangled in.I also need to buy property insurance in addition to paying off my back taxes.  In February 2015, I accidently set my house on fire.  Without going into elaborate detail about what I discuss with my shrink, the fire was triggered by my PTSD. I maintained quarterly payments on the property insurance since returning to the US in 2007; but, in 2011, the area was struck by Hurricane Irene; and the insurance company refused to renew my policy because, as one representative explained by phone, too many insurance claims were reported in my area. Additionally, the insurance company hired a scumbag private investigator to illegally photograph my property while I was out of the country. I did not give my consent.  The fact the insurance company was unwilling to insure  the homes in my neighborhood leads me to suspect they were engaged in the racist practice of redlining. Corporate legalese would explain this deliberate neglect of a non-white population otherwise.The only way I can re-insure my property is to take out a policy that requires I pay the entire yearly dividend of a thousand or more dollars up front. This is impossible as I pay monthly on my property taxes, delinquent water-pollution and electric bills in addition to general overhead. This also leaves no funds for much-needed home repairs, which includes a new furnace and a leaking roof. Recently, I had to remove the ceiling in my living room due to excessive water damage.  It is cold and drafty here.In 2019, my sister moved into a senior-citizen complex. As a result, she is no longer able to help with the expense of our house upkeep. An obvious solution would be to sell the property and relocate. However, I can’t do that. I contracted a serious case of pneumonia in 2008, spending two glorious weeks blissed out on morphine, and was required to sign up for the state’s health insurance program in order to cover the enormous expense of my hospital stay with the stipulation if I ever sold my property I would return their money first. Since, more liens have been attached to my property because of my month and a half long stay in rehab (2 ½ years clean) and regular psychiatric visits (unlike some, I am not opposed to psychiatry. I’ve been surrounded by shrinks since childhood, given my mother worked in that field. However, I do know you have to keep watch on their motives.  Observe carefully). Selling would only add to the instability of my life.Obviously, I’ve never had any interest in building a life based on money, property and ownership. I cultivated a life that was ethereal and bohemian in nature. I achieved that and was quite happy with it. Admittedly, I fucked up plenty but I don’t regret it. I could write, create and pursue my rather outre’ interests. Writing has not made me any money but it has granted me an enviable level of freedom and social access.  But I was never prepared for this life. I was popped from my little bohemian soap bubble and dropped into a tangle of grief, depression, confusion and rage.  Reluctantly, I adapted. Why? I care deeply for my sister.  If I didn’t, I would have been out of here years ago.There are many more aspects I could detail -- my father’s anger and unrelenting stubbornness after I explained my sister and I didn’t want the financial responsibility of maintaining this property (then falling off a roof two weeks later without a chance to really digest what I had told him); my tenant’s inability to pay his rent for several years because his wages were garnished by a previous landlord (he has since resumed payment in the last few years, including arrears, but the financial damage is done); the fact I cannot secure a bank loan, though I have a much-improved credit rating; or the lack of, to put it politely, a ‘traditional network of support’ (otherwise, this situation could have been avoided in the aftermath of the house fire) -- but I think I’ve overwhelmed you with enough details describing the direness of my situation. This appeal is the only option left. If this is unsuccessful, I lose my house and I’m on the streets. Panhandling.Sixty-thousand dollars is the amount I need to pay back-taxes; secure property insurance; repair my roof; replace the furnace; fix the walls in my home; redo the electrical and plumbing systems; and pay off assorted debts.With my house rehabbed and insured, I would rent it. The house will pay for itself: taxes, insurance and maintenance. I would then move back to Europe (I was only a few months shy of EU citizenship before I returned to the US), hang out with my anarcho-commie buddies, maintain a multimedia broad-casting base, write book & film projects, and completely devote myself to a life of meditative spiritual practice.If finding an affordable situation in Berlin proves impossible (it was wildly gentrified on my last visit), I’ll travel until I find a home. Possible destinations range anywhere from Iceland to Ghana, but it will be a spot that will provide a heated, stress-free environment supportive of my productivity. The U.S. has been out of the question for decades. The ast four years have only confirmed what I’ve been saying since high school. This country may experience a ‘lull’ for the next four years after January 20th, but given the precedents set by the Lego-blockhead heading the current administration, exposing both the fragility of our “democracy”, and the despicable degree of cowardice among elected Democrats to allow this criminal to freely pursue his course (despite their bs to the contrary), an equivalent in goo-coiffed greedheads, fed on anabolic steroids and medical-grade cocaine, is in the American future, and will play this country like Steven Spielberg at a kiddie movie-matinee, complete with white Jesus blasting an AR-15.

Back around October Dwight was experiencing some heart problems, he finally went into the hospital around January 5th; From there he has had extensive care along with heart surgery, unfortunately things didn’t go as planned! he had experienced other health complications that prolonged rehab for him, The doctors were hopeful and really thought things were going to be OK but he was just tired I wanted to go home to his wife and dog... so that’s what’s going to happen; his wife Debbie as many of you know really only spent her time with him, and she is going through a hard time but holding her self together very well for the time being and has already figured out all the costs for the cremation and what not but it’s getting a little bit stressful for her to deal with, so all donations will be going straight to her so she can pay off his medical bills and buy him the Urn he deserves to come home in...

he was a pretty private person and I am trying to word it that way but with as much detail for all of you to understand, he loved each and everyone of you with all of his heart and he will never forget a single thing the relationships and bonds he has had over his 65 years of life has been amazing to read my grandpa was an amazing guy and you are all so lucky to have so many memories with him

Unfortunately, my diagnosis was delayed, but I got right on track and lived a normal life up until early this year.It turns out that I have a 10cm abscess in my right lung that is filled with antibiotic resistant infections, which means I pretty much only have ¼ of my right lung remaining. My left lung is doing most of the work but it also is infected with these nasty bugs, all together my lung function is at 23%, so now I am in need of a life saving double lung transplant.I just went through my 5 day evaluation at Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina. They have accepted me into their transplant program and it’s now time for me to temporarily relocate there and start pulmonary rehab and IV antibiotics to prepare myself for transplant. Relocating is not easy and it’s very expensive while trying to keep our home at the same time. Not only do we have to pay our current mortgage, bills and rent at a new place, the cost of fuel and food is also going to add up. I will need to be living in Durham for a minimum of 6 months but up to a year.

He spends his nights and all but a few hours of his days in his hospital bed, unable to see outside his bedroom window. Though he has a wheelchair, we have no way totransport him outside of our home so that he can interact with the outside world-- outside of emergency room visits and doctor's appointments. He has not been able to receive the kind of consistent rehab his body needs and his recovery requires, as we have no way of getting him to the facilities that can help. When I asked him what a van would allow him to do, he said, ""I could get out.. I wouldn't be a prisoner of thishospital bed."" He has spent the last four and a half yearsfeeling this way. I asked what having a new set of wheels would change. He said, ""Everything.""

He loves the Philadelphia Phillies, Eagles, and Flyers, is obsessed with Pepper-Jack Grilled Cheese Sandwiches, and could sing along with his Doc Watson CD's for hours. He used to ride a motorcycle (in the ""before-kids"" era), has had a life-long relationship with BOOST (that's a true Riverside boy, for ya!) and loves surrounding himself with positive quotes and laughter.He has become pretty close with his friendson Castle, NCIS, and Bones (we call him Stevie-the-TV for a reason!)andshakes his hospital bed with belly laughs whilewatching Ellen Degeneres and The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.He played a remarkable role in developing the softball programin Burlington Township, where many of you remember him in his glory. He was the ultimate ""Softball Dad"" and to call himpassionate would be an understatement. Hewas the Vice President of the BT Girls Softball Association and a coach to hundreds of girls for over ten years--he loved that it was his life.

My father is a fighter, but it is my mother whose relentless pursuit gives us ALLstrength.DECEMBER 30TH IS STEVE & BETH'S 25 YEAR ANNIVERSARY.WHAT A GIFT TO CELEBRATE SUCH A BEAUTIFUL MARRIAGE...THIS VAN WILL LET THEM BOTH HAVE THE BEST SHOT AT THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.He is also a father to four,Zachary Sabo, ""Zack"", 25, BTHS 2007Elizabeth Woodward, ""Liz"", 24, HCHS 2009Rebecca Woodward, ""Becky"", 23, HCHS 2010Catherine Woodward, ""Catie"", 20, BTHS 2012and since his injury, ALL of our lives have changed dramatically. We have all learned SO MUCH, grown tremendously, and we are all extremely grateful for all of your support andcontributions.We have rented a van before, twice actually, so that my Dad could attend his father's funeral and his daughter's graduation, since transport isn't covered unless your trip is deemed medically necessary (andit's very expensive out of pocket, even to rent for a few hours). It was the first time since his aneurysm ruptured that he was able to interact with family members and friends he hadn't seen in years. We watched my father smile and we witnessed joy and accomplishment, and we watched his memory strengthen with every person who left his side in disbelief that he could remember exactly who they were and what got them in trouble back in the day. See, my Dad is still Steve. He's just Steve who survived a brain injury and now uses a wheelchair. He deserves to be Steve and not just a patient or a number on a chart. He needs a van. A brand new rear-entry van could cost us $60,000-$80,000-- especially since he needs a hydraulic lift, and even used vans can cost over $20,000.. but hey, we need to start somewhere.*100% OF WHAT WE RAISE WILL GO TOWARDS A HANDICAPPED-ACCESSIBLE VAN FOR STEVE (besides a very small percentage that goes to this site for its services.) If we surpass our goal (what a dream come true!), any additional funds will go directly towards equipment and resources relating to Steve's care.^^ this is what we need!^^this is how we get him out of bed. A hoyer lift, a sling, two people, 30 minutes, and a lot of patience, strategy, and maneuvering. Oh, and that nice shiney floor pictured was in our old house-- it's A LOT MORE CHALLENGING (if not near-impossible) on carpet.My father lost his job during the economic recession in 2008, lost his independence in 2010, and we lost our hometoforeclosure in 2014, but we refuse to lose hope! Stevehas never lost his spirit, his humor, or his determination. He has never lost his fight and he has never lost sight of his dreams. His ability to wake up with a smile and continue to see the good in whatever comes our way is an honor to witness and serves as a reminder to be grateful every day.1. Support us! Donate to the dream! Any amount helps and we are strong believers in the power of prayer and positivity. Every little bit counts!! We can do this!!2. Share our story,with your family, your coworkers, your colleagues, your community, your neighbors, your friends, your social network, your clients or your customers >> you get the idea! Together we can change my father's world. Together we can make a difference. Isn't that what we're all here for?! Have you been lookingfor a cause you can stand behind? This is it! Waiting for a sign? Here it is! Let's do it!3. Stay positive. Good health is a privilege. Quit taking the one body you've been blessed with for granted. Schedule an appointment and get over your fear of the doctor. ""Out of sight, out of mind"" meant NOTHING when my Dad's aneurysm ruptured and he started bleeding into his brain. He was helping a friend with yardword.. It was just another day.

He was diagnosed with a severe staph infection in his blood. In a matter of just a few days, this infection destroyed most of Ryan’s aortic heart valve, caused two separate strokes to the right side of his brain, and damaged his kidneys. An unknown, pre-existing condition in his heart accelerated the damage caused by the infection, leading to a very immediate life-threatening situation for an otherwise healthy 30 year old.Upon diagnosis, Ryan was brought in for emergency open-heart surgery under the supervision of Dr. Ranjit John to remove the bulk of the infection from his heart and install a mechanical aortic heart valve. After a long 6 hours, we learned that surgery went exceptionally well. Due to Dr. John’s skill and the incredible cardiac team at Hennepin Healthcare, Ryan came out of surgery and was able to continue his fight.Days later, Ryan’s battle continued with a second open-heart surgery to remove fluid surrounding his heart and lungs, along with a series of scans and tests to assess the damage caused by his strokes. He’s had IVs, PICC lines, and chest tubes that would be countless if not for the scars left behind on his chest and body. Through all of this, Ryan’s resolve hasn’t faltered. He’s handled 63 days in the hospital, in and out of operating rooms and rehab centers, with true grit and optimism; the kind of determination that you only really understand if you know Ry.Due to the pandemic, our family has been constrained to manage Ryan’s care from a distance and attempt to deliver our love through an iPad screen. Thankfully, we were finally able to take Ryan home to Rush Lake this weekend where he began his outpatient recovery. He’ll be staying with Alex (Ryan’s older brother) so that he can recover close to family instead of in a hospital room. Drew (Ryan’s younger brother) and Rachel (Ryan’s girlfriend) are frequently visiting to keep Ryan company. Connie and Mike (Ryan’s parents) are also close by to keep an eye on him and help with his meals, appointments, and provide transportation.While we’re so grateful for this huge milestone, Ryan still has a long road ahead. He’ll need some close care and supervision as he recovers physically, and he has deficits in his short-term memory function that will take some time and therapy to improve. Ryan also still has one more major heart surgery in his future to repair or replace a second heart valve that was recently found to be failing. We’re confident that Ryan’s sheer will of character, paired with his strong support network of friends and family, will propel him into brighter days ahead...maybe with just a few extra robot parts than expected.Many folks have reached out to ask how they can help. Our family, and Ryan especially, are so humbled by this. As many of you know, Ryan has been proudly self-employed for several years now, working to build his dream as a small-business owner. Unfortunately, this also means that Ryan’s individual self-pay health insurance is not as robust as one might hope for in a situation like this. We had intentions to host a benefit for Ryan, but given the circumstances of the pandemic, it makes public gatherings very challenging. We’re starting to see some large bills come in and much of Ryan’s care was out-of-network. In addition, it may take Ryan a bit of time to get his memory and strength back enough to return to work.If you know Ryan, you know that he’s typically one to lend a hand rather than ask for help himself. But today is a bit different, whether we like it or not. If you’d like to help Ryan out with his finances, no matter the amount, our family would be incredibly grateful. If you know others who may be interested in helping out as well, please share with your network as you see fit.Thank you all for being a part of Ryan’s life and for taking the time to read his story. He can’t wait to see you all again soon and celebrate the great years to come!Cheers,Alex & Drew (Ryan’s brothers)Read more"

Thank you so much for visiting this page. I'm Poppy's aunt, and biggest fan.A few months ago, Poppy suffered a traumatic dog attack that resulted in a life-threatening injury to her head and brain. What occurred immediately after is truly a miracle. Poppy fought for her life, and the incredible doctors and nurses at Cedars Sinai operated on her and nursed her for the following three weeks.Since mid-September, Poppy has been under excellent care at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and is anticipated to remain inpatient until the Spring. She has undergone a series of neurosurgical and plastic surgery operations. The injury resulted in weakness to the right side of her body and neurologically, Poppy is having to relearn a number of skills so she participates in therapy on a daily basis.This week marks yet another plastic surgery operation. Following the initial recovery and another surgery in a few months, she will graduate from acute care to the inpatient rehab facility for intensive physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Poppy continues to showcase her determination and will on a daily basis and she is well loved by all her doctors, nurses, and therapists. She has been coined the resident “Pop Star.""We decided to start a fundraising page for Ali (my sister), Jim (my brother-in-law), and Poppy to help ease the thought of the future, which is largely unknown at this point. Poppy likely has another 3-6 months in the hospital and will need to have ongoing therapies and medical support to aid her immediate and long term recovery.Any contribution to Poppy's future would be humbly appreciated. We also ask that you to continue to pray for Poppy, Ali, and Jim. Your prayers have already worked miracles and we're incredibly grateful for all of the love and support.On behalf of my family, we wish you all a holiday season filled with gratitude, love, and peace.Read more"

Take a second to Google that... If the results were limited to non-existent, that's because there are less than 500 cases in the world of this type of cancer.Sara is a loving, smart, beautiful woman, wife and daughter whose life has been turned upside down in a matter of months from this aggressive cancer. What started as abdominal discomfort and a single large unknown tumor on her left ovary, rapidly morphed into a life threatening and deadly cancer spreading throughout her abdomen and around her lower spine causing her to temporarily lose the use of her legs. Since June 18th, Sara has undergone 2 major tumor debulking operations and has most recently been in the hospital for 10 weeks undergoing radiation to treat the tumors on her spine and a customized chemotherapy/immunotherapy regimen to fight off the cancer.The radiation did help significantly reduce her back pain and bring back feeling in her legs and feet. Working with OT and PT daily she’s making good strides rebuilding strength.Unfortunately, the chemotherapy/immunotherapy failed with the cancer continuing to grow and spread. At this stage, the oncology team believes her cancer is incurable giving her 1-3 months to live in a hospice setting.
Well, Sara is far from ready to just be done. She’s always embraced holistic healing and living as a way of life and is committed to using every option available to heal from this cancer. So, while continuing to regain independence, mobility and strength to walk at an acute rehabilitation facility, she is also researching experimental, naturopathic and alternative treatments for her cancer.The exact costs for fully treating Sara, especially as we step into the world insurance won’t cover, are not known. Her path to healing and walking will likely take time. Derek (with the help of Sara’s Mom, Ann) has been caring full-time for Sara, and when she comes home from the rehabilitation facility, we expect that to continue for some time. Any funds we collect here, will be 100% put towards paying for experimental treatments, rehabilitation, in home healthcare and all related costs to get Sara healthy and back on her feet.We are looking to reach our fundraising goal by the end of October as that’s when Sara is scheduled to leave rehab and come home to a house with all of the devices she’ll need to be successful at living. It will also ensure Derek and Sara can keep emotionally focused on healing, while not having to worry about the costs associated with Sara’s treatment. One of the biggest hurdles Sara is facing, is the rarity of her cancer. Less than 500 people worldwide have been diagnosed similarly, and so we need to elevate and amplify this as much as possible. Use #SarasTeam when sharing this with your social media.The speed that this cancer has attacked the Lauber family has been incredible. It snuck up on them and it struck quickly. Let's show that we can fight back even faster so Sara can heal from the cancer.We are asking for what they won’t ask for… Help to bring a miracle to life.For those of you who have been generous, with your love, prayers, healing energy and financial gifts to date, we thank you again.

For those of you that do know me, you know how much of a daddy's girl I am. For 32 years, he has been the most reliable, responsible, and strongest man I know. He would not leave me hanging in a time like this and I surely will not leave him. Now I want to help him and my mom in any way I can during the most difficult time in all of our livesOver the last 2 weeks my family and I have been with him at UPMC as he as gone through 7 surgeries/anesthesia in 9 days (2 of those were emergencies). To say this has been a roller coaster is an understatement. As soon as we think we are on the road to recovery we are hit with another jab in our bellies.What is going on.....On March 6th, dad was admitted to UPMC for surgical treatment on an infected graft in his abdominal cavity. The original grafts were about 15 years old and had given him no problems up until last year. The surgery itself was extremely complex and the chances of him making it out of surgery alone were not as great as we would've liked but there was no alternative. They were replacing a graft that had already been replaced. Here we are about 2 weeks later and dad is still putting up a fight.Over these 2 weeks these are some of the hurdles that he has overcome:- perforated small intestine (repaired)-part of large intestine removed-required 23 units of blood in the first 24 hours out after surgery- BP has required lots of medication to control it-he had a stroke-a knicked bladder-abdominal compartment syndrome from being closed to early (led to emergency surgery last night).The list goes on but these are some of the things he has endured and is continuing to push on.Currently, dad is still on the ventilator but has become more responsive (although right now this seems to change daily). Today has been a good day so far but I am honestly terrified of what the next hour can bring based on all that has happened in the last 10-14 days.What are these funds for?I would like to start out by saying this money will not be used in any way by my brother and I. It will be going directly to my mom and dad.Due to dads illnesses in the past year he is running short on PTO time. Currently, he has PTO to take until April 18th. Once this time runs out,they will be living on 1 military pension that I am not sure will cover all of their bills and making living very difficult. This is also not accounting for hotels for my mom. I am applying for FMLA for him but that time off will not be paid. Dad had plans to retire in about 2 years but ultimately this is going to push him into retirement sooner that he would've liked. These funds will help them survive until his retirement funds can be accessed and he is back up on his feet.He will also be needed an extended rehab program in a facility. Hoping to relocate them to Augusta, GA.Read more"

Last June when he was 33 years old the following real life nightmarebegan. Today, he is an amputee.                              ---A little about him--- This is not hisfirst bout with death, The summer after 4th grade his appendix ruptured and he spent 49 days in 2 seperate hospitals including a 12 day stay in the ICU with a fever spiking at 106.7. He is a self taught guitarist since the age of 15. He has always had an extreme passion for music. Especially metal. He was a smoker for 15 years. During Hurricane Sandy, he finally quit when he discovered vaping. What was a tool towardsa healthier lifestyle became a hobby and then his very own business when he started Dripbox Modz LLC out of his grandparents garage in the fall of 2014. Late June 2016 he had a flare up of his Crohn's disease and was admitted to Community Hospital in Toms River, NJ. They located an abscess, and a partial blockage of his small intestine. They inserted a JP drain to remove the abscess, and tried to medically treat him. After 2 weeks they advised him that they would be transferring him to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, NJ. Thats when all hell broke loose. I'll try to explain this to the best of my ability.Uponadmitting him, his condition started to detiorate rapidly. They inserted a Picc line in his neck, which is basically a long term IV, and he was placed in the ICU. Wewere there to visit and left around 7pm. Shortly after, the picc line became infected and Bobbywent into septic shock. His blood pressure plummitted and by midnight the hospital was calling saying they needed us to get back there right away!We were told more than once to prepare for the worst, and that he may not make it totomorrow. To raise his blood pressure the medicines administered to save his life and keep his vital organs going also caused an adverse reaction. As I understand it those medicines prioritized bloodflow to his major organs, but as a result thebloodflow to his extremities was limited. And because the bloodvessels in your extremities are so small, and the lack of circulation for so long, Bobby developed Dry Gangrene on his hands and feet. Bobby awoke 9 days later with no recollection of the days lost and in shock of his situation. He had a feeding tube in his nose, a breathing tube down his throat, he couldn't speak, a urinary and rectal catheter, there were about 13 different IV drugs being administered, his hands and feet were fully bandaged, and he was on dialysis. He also noticed a slight hearing loss in his left ear, as well as a blurry spot in the center of his vision out of his left eye.But he was alive! -This is during that first 9 days were Bobby was sedated and on dialysis fighting to stay alive.Pictured below is the early onset, when there was still a posibility treatment could work and that circulation to his extremities could be restored.Bobby spent the next two and a half months at RWJUH bouncing between ICU, CCU, MICU, and the occasional regular patient floor before some problem or infection arose beinging him back to a critical care area of the hospital. At one point he went almost 30 days without food or water by mouth. He had to be tested by a specialist to see if he could even swallow a teaspoon of water let alone anything else before he could be allowed anything by mouth. That first test was a Friday.He failed. Hewas so thirsty that he literally cried. Hehad to wait until Monday to retake the test. He was bed ridden the entire timeand as such lost about 50lbs. He had a few bald spots on the back of his head from constant bedrest. Bobbywas unable to walk, or do much of anything for himself. The realization that he would at some point lose a portion of all his fingers and most likely not be able to continue his business, or ever play guitar again with the proficiency that he once could weighed very heavily on him. At this point he was alsodiagnosed with depression.That was just the beginning of what has been the last 13 months of Bobby'sife. I'll try to summarize the best I can the next 10 months.-He was transferred late September to Care One at East Brunswick, NJ to begin rehabilitation. (pictured above) He was there approximately 3 weeks before developing an infection related to his crohns disease and rushed back to RWJUH. While at the rehab, they failed to take proper care or his JP drain and it became clogged. In what he described as sheer agony they had to remove the 2ft section of tubing from his abscess, while fully conscious. And then re insert a larger gauge 2ft length of tube back into the same site. Bobby has always had a seriously high pain threshold, and hearing him recount the procedure was horrifying. During this visit he also developed anenterocutaneous fistulafrom the Crohns. Whichis an abnormal communication between the small or large bowel and the skin.He was hospitalized 2 more months. Where he spent Halloween, his 34th birthday, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. At this point he was down 98lbs in 6 months.-Bobby was then transferred to Rehab at Rivers edge in Raritan, NJ. Again he was only there 3 weeks before developing another Crohns related infection, and back to RWJUH. This time for another2 weeks. During this hospitalization his left pinky toe auto amputated.(If you can see the dotted lines, thats what they estimated would remain after amputation)-Next it was Care One Edison, NJ. While herehis left pinky auto amputated.Once againhe was there approximately 4 weeks before developing another Crohns related infection that put him back in RWJUH for about 3 weeks.-This time Bobby was sent to Care One Holmdel, NJ where he only spent 3 days. The hospital wouldnt let him stay until his surgery, so instead they shuffled him like an old book an hour away from family and friends to sit alone before a traumatic life changing surgery.-Back to RWJUH for scheduled surgery March 24th 2017 whereall 10 of histoes were amputated. Bobby wore size 11-1/2 sneakers. Now, without inserts, he's actually a size 5.During this stay his right thumb auto amputated. It was like this for months before finally falling off.Exactly one week later he underwent a second surgery to repair the enterocutaneous fistulathat developed in his stomach and finally remove the JP drain that had been in his side for 10 months. By now the drain was replaced not once, but twice. (suggested every 3 months) In the same horribly painful procedure as described earlier. This was an extremely stressful surgery for his family. On top of everything hewas already dealing with, there was a chance that once the surgeons got inside things could be beyond repair and Bobby would need an Ileostomy. Thank god that wasnt the case, and surgery went better than expected for both procedures. Hespent another 2 weeks recovering before being transferred again to rehab for the 5th time.-This time Bobby was sent back to Rehab at Rivers Edge, to recover.-June 14th, hewas back at RWJUH for same day surgery at 10:30am to remove the gangrene portion of his left hand. Luckily it went flawlessly and a little over 12hrs later he was back in his bed at rehab sound asleep, and recovering.Fast forward to present day. Bobby'sfeet are almostfully healed and he is able to walk unassisted. He has gained back about 50lbs and is currently a healthy 185. His left hand is almost healed, and the process for a fully functional robotic prosthesis has just begun as of late last week.(This is what's possiblewith the i-digits quantum)(These are current7/23 photo's)Bobby'slast and final surgery to remove the gangrene portion of his right handwill take place in the next few weeks.For now he continues to participate in physical and occupational therapy, and is getting stronger everyday. Its been a horrific 13 months, and he just wants to go home. He hasnt slept in his own bed since June 23rd, 2016. He desperately needs some type of normalcy, and to be able to regain his independance. A physical rehabilitation center is noplace for a 34 year old man who previously had a job, a business, a girlfriend, a home, and a life.It's mentally and emotionally exhausting for him. I personally want to thank all of his close friends that made countless visits to his bedside, whether in the hospital, or any of his rehab facilities. You'll never know just how much your time helped not only him, but his entire family.Thanks so much for taking the time to read hisstory.PLEASE consider helping in anyway you can.

He was having severe headaches in February of 2012. He went to the hospital and they found a tumor the size of a grapefruit. He had surgery, chemo, radiation, and did a trial drug. He had been doing very well until his routine MRI in December when they saw that the cancer had returned. On December 21st he had another surgery. During surgery he had a stroke which left him unable to move his left side. On Christmas Eve he went into a coma and had to have another surgery to remove part of his skull to allow for swelling. He was in Pennsylvania hospital for 10 days and then transferred to Moss rehab where he currently still is. He has been making a lot of progress, but is still unable to walk. We met with his therapists and they went over everything he will need before he returns home which is set for Feb. 4th. The main expense is a 68 foot ramp for his 10 steps to get to his door, along with many other things including a bath seat, a bed rail, a table top magnify lamp for his poor vision, railings for the house etc.) This is very difficult for our family to ask for help, but it's something that's necessary to bring Mike home where he wants to be. His wife and 8 year old son can't wait to have him home and raising money will take a huge burden off of them so they can focus on Mikes recovery. He is going to start chemo 2 weeks after he gets home. He has come so far, but he still has a long way to go. He has more faith than anyone I know. He has a loving dedicated family and the best friends and support system anyone could hope for. Thank you so much for all the love, support and prayers. Read more"

English:This is my father-in-law Inocencio Valverde and covid-19 should’ve been his cause of death. However he is a resilient man who fought a good fight and won. Doctors and nurses really didn’t think he was gonna make it. We were told his chances of survival were a single digit number. Death was holding his hand and all we could do was pray. We prayed and it wasn’t that kind of pray where you sit quietly and ask for God to help, it was the kind of pray where you fall to your knees and yell to the lord and cry out in hopes that he gives him another chance at life. I had even called a funeral home to see what their protocol was for taking someone who was positive. By the grace of god, our prayers were heard and my father-in-law was given another chance at life. My husband and I dropped him off at the ER after his 3 day fever wouldn’t break, we left with the intention of being back maybe after two days to pick him up. Within less than an hour of dropping him off at the ER he was admitted into ICU and put on a ventilator. He’s been hospitalized for two months with the majority of his time being spent in ICU. He later made enough progress to be moved to PCU. Yesterday we received good news and he has been accepted for rehab! While he was in ICU the only movement he did was when doctors and nurses would prone him so he became very weak. He’s made a lot of progress and is able to stand with the help of two nurses. With the help of rehab he will one day stand on his own. We now need help to cover some costs and financially help my mother-in-law who has been out of work since Washington’s stay at home order was put in place. Since my father-in-law will need full time care after he is discharged from rehab she won’t be able to go back to work. We are asking that you give us any help you can. Anything helps, even a prayer. Thank you for taking the time to read this. We appreciate any help we get.Spanish: Este es mi suegro Inocencio Valverde y covid-19 debería haber sido su causa de muerte. Sin embargo, es un hombre fuerte que peleo una buena pelea y gano. Los médicos y las enfermeras realmente no pensaron que lo iba a lograr. Nos dijeron que sus posibilidades de supervivencia eran menos de un 10 por ciento. La muerte estaba sosteniendo su mano y todo lo que podíamos hacer era rezar. Oramos y no fue ese tipo de oración donde te sientas en silencio y le pides ayuda a Dios, fue la clase de oración donde caes de rodillas y le gritas al señor con la esperanza de que él le dé otra oportunidad de vida. Incluso había llamado a una funeraria para ver cuál era su protocolo para llevar a alguien que fuera positivo. Por la gracia de Dios, nuestras oraciones fueron escuchadas y mi suegro tuvo otra oportunidad de vivir. Mi esposo y yo lo dejamos en la sala de emergencias después de que su fiebre de 3 días no se le bajaba, nos fuimos con la intención de regresar quizás después de dos días para recogerlo. En menos de una hora de dejarlo en la sala de emergencias, fue admitido a cuidado intensivo y le pusieron un ventilador. Ha estado hospitalizado durante dos meses y la mayor parte de su tiempo lo pasó en cuidado intensivo. Cuando se recuperó lo suficiente lo movieron a cuidado progresivo. ¡Ayer recibimos buenas noticias y ha sido aceptado para rehabilitación! Mientras estaba en cuidado intensivo el único movimiento que hizo fue cuando los médicos y las enfermeras lo acostaban de pecho y se debilitó mucho. Ha progresado mucho y puede ponerse de pie con la ayuda de dos enfermeras. Con la ayuda de la rehabilitación, esperemos que puedo pararse el solo. Ahora necesitamos ayuda para cubrir algunos gastos y ayudar económicamente a mi suegra, que ha estado sin trabajo desde que el estado de Washington puso la orden de quedarse en casa. Como mi suegro necesitará ayuda de tiempo completo después de que le den de alta de la rehabilitación, no podrá volver a trabajar mi suegra. Le pedimos que nos brinde toda la ayuda que pueda. Cualquier cosa ayuda, incluso una oración. Gracias por tomarse el tiempo de leer esto. Agradecemos cualquier ayuda que recibamos.

After being in the emergency room and intensive care for several weeks, despite immediate action, she is now immobilized fully on her left side, and residing in a rehabilitation facility which will allow her to regain function. She has already started on this recovery process, now 2 weeks in, with some notable improvements, first of which with her speech; and now regaining feeling in her leg and arm through daily therapy and movement exercises, which is very promising.We have been lucky thus far to have had insurance to cover the cost of the rehab expenses, however, that has now run out, despite a lot of dialogue with the insurance company. Staying and completing the full duration of recovery will be essential in her returning both to work as a full time family lawyer, but also to her life as the charismatic amazing woman she is, FULL of energy and life.The facility provides full time professional care for her, aiding in helping her stand, bathing her, taking her to the bathroom; and completing basic routines that are quite difficult for someone in her position. Furthermore, aiding her with expert medical advice and therapy techniques to improve motor skills, to allow her to walk and operate independently in the future. Having this duration cut short and her returning home, despite how much we would love her here, and how much we miss her, is not the right decision.The difficulties with money are complicated significantly by Covid. Although we had been working to bring in money, the recent dramatic rise in Covid cases in Puerto Rico, including a confirmed case at one of our workplaces, we need to isolate ourselves from exposure for the safety of our mother. We are living in Carolina, Puerto Rico, and unfortunately due to increased tourism with these summer months, despite our incredibly strict lockdown (90 days completely inside since March, mandated and ticketed), cases have reached an all time high.The expertise needed to make sure our mother completes her rehabilitation can only be provided by an institution specialized to ensure this recovery. The therapies are very expensive, but extremely necessary. Our mother needs all the help she can get. She has always provided everything to us, all alone, and we are only trying to return nothing less than what she deserves.We would like to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for any bit of aid you could provide, it means so much to our family. Any amount is welcome. Thank you and please SHARE!!\Read more"

She is still currently dealing with the damage left behind as she continues to have more surgeries and ongoing treatment and care. Her life has changed forever and for now - consists of being in and out of hospital. On Tuesday 9th August, Sarah was rushed to hospital with extreme flu symptoms and deteriorated rapidly. She shut down before our eyes over a 12 hour period and we were told she might not make it, having to enter her room at each critical phase and see her in case she didn’t make it.After 5 days we were given a diagnosis- meningococcal. Luckily, when Sarah was first admitted- she was given the right antibiotic to treat meningococcal and the teams at Gosford Hospital worked rapidly to assist her - they have been, and continue to be amazing. It’s unknown how she caught it, and we will never know. After 8 days, on life support with a room full of machines keeping her going Sarah beat all odds and woke up. She's now off life support, awake and communicating with us and facing a very long and slow road to recovery. She's had nurses and doctors in tears, shocked and relieved at her progress and she's fought this with everything she has – barely a complaint. She’s extremely strong willed and is the toughest girl we know.Her kidneys will not repair and she most likely faces life on dialysis with the hope of a kidney transplant. She has had surgery to insert a catheter in her stomach so she will be able to have dialysis at home when it heals. She has had some finger and toe amputations as well as reconstructive surgery on her right hand and both feet. She will need to slowly learn to stand and walk again and is now building strength with physio each day. She has needed assistance with breathing and she has needed blood transfusions. She is having ongoing trouble with a lot of her organs and will be seeking treatment for her heart and liver. She has also major surgery to remove her spleen. This bacterial infection is a horrible, debilitating disease and has caused more damage to her body than we can comprehend or process – but being the hero she is, its hasn’t weakened her spirit.As she copes with the physical pain and ongoing emotional stress, we are now also facing the lifestyle changes that lay ahead for her and the financial realities ahead. She will need dialysis every 2 days at hospital pending a transplant - until she is ready for home dialysis. She requires intensive on going rehab, physio and full time care initially - and aides such as a walking frame and a wheelchair to help her till shes strong enough to walk again. It is unclear if or when she will be able to return to work and in what capacity and has had to move back hom with her parents who are also making huge life sacrifices to give her the care and love she needs. We’ve had so many people offering support and asking how they can help her, so some family members have now suggested this page for people who wish to donate to her recovery and assist her in getting back on track.We thank everyone for all the love, and joining us in helping Sarah in her fight to kick this things butt!**For most the current updates, please see the 'UPDATES' section on this page, tab above.

Please read! I know it’s long but please read. 

My sister Reagan is terminally ill with not long to live. She’s out of state to be near her doctors. Her conditions are ones I can’t even pronounce.
After a lot of thought and not wanting to, I set up this gofundme. So far, me, my mother and one good friend have kept Reagan in hotels near her doctors for weeks. She came here to stay with us but it didn’t last because there’s just no way she can’t be close to the doctors. She is in a program that’s SUPPOSED to give her free housing but due to coronavirus the office has been closed and they are saying now it may take months. We may have to find her an apartment with utilities included to save money. It’s like every step forward she’s knocked 3 steps back. And they keep telling her to wait. How do we wait when time is the one thing they tell her she doesn’t have? She’s only 40, and She has SEVERAL illnesses including colon disorders, crohn’s disease, some form of pancreatic cancer, a pancreatic clot and clot in her heart, she had gastric bypass years ago with complications and surgeries so she can no longer absorb nutrients and vitamins at all, she requires transfusions and injections weekly, and to be totally honest with everyone they gave her maybe 2 months to live. We are gonna believe in God and His report and not the doctors but- the doctors report is not good. They don’t know how she’s still here. She’s on disability but it’s barely enough to pay for her car and insurance and a storage bill cus she’s homeless- and has to have a car to get to the doctors. Most of her meds we have had to pay out of pocket and try to get reimbursement. She has about 10 different doctors.
So for now we have to pay weekly to keep a hotel near her doctors. Occasionally she will have a friend let her stay one night or something but- this is coming straight out of me or my parents personal accounts which are wearing thin. They are on a fixed income. But We can’t bear for her to sleep in her car- to the point we will go broke keeping her in a comfortable bed. And we are. She’s been at a comfort inn all this week.
So many people have helped Alysia (Reagan’s niece who was in a horrible accident) that we were not gonna post anything financial about Reagan but being asked to by a couple people, I’m going to. I’ll exhaust my funds before I let her sleep in a car. Reagan is a loving person who just wants to live but has accepted the fact that God may have other plans. She loves her grandchildren and family and friends.
Reagan is a hard worker and she’s even talking about get a part time job but she has zero energy and now an infection in her tooth and it’s just so many things piled on top of each other it seems almost hopeless. But it’s not! God is in control no matter what. But working is unrealistic for her. 
Anyway, once again all we truly ask for is prayer. I just know some people are blessed enough to bless others. Hopefully even if it just ends up helping with a week of hotel bills it will ease my parents’ finances. 
She has her boyfriend up there but he’s sick with cancer and not able to do much but be there for support at this point. 
The devil is after our family bad. My dad has had major shoulder pain from a wreck that caused a bad neck injury and can’t even move sometimes. The devil just didn’t know he was coming after a praying family with a lot of support. Thank God Reagan’s niece has made progress, From not knowing if she would have major brain damage to ready for rehab in less than 3 weeks. Keep them prayers coming. 
It means a lot to my family and I. 
We are forced lately just to put our whole lives public because the prayers were more important than our pride. And I am so thankful for all of y’all. Truly. 
God bless all of you!

He is 18 years old and a graduating senior at Argyle High School. From the accident, Garretthas a severe break in his back that required an 8 hour surgery on Tuesday, May 5th. Unfortunately, Garrett is paralyzed in the lower part of his body. He is also having trouble breathing due to a lung injury from the accident and a very bad case of pneumonia. He is in critical condition in ICU at Baylor Grapevine and only 1 parent is allowed in his room at a time.On Friday, May 15th, the family had a big scare. Garrett blew out a hole in his lung and under went another surgery on Saturday, May 16th to repair the lung. The surgery took much longer than expected, but was successful. The doctors removed a portion of his lower lung lobe to repair the hole. Assuming no complications arise from the repaired lung, doctors will begin addressing the pneumonia and breathing issues once again before Garrett can start rehab. Doctors indicate this is going to take time for Garrett to heal due to all of the injuries and infections in his lungs. Garrett will need to over come a lot of obstacles to recover from this accident.Bob and Jennifer are daily amazed and very appreciative for all the support and prayers from family, friends, and the Argyle community. As you can imagine, there is large amounts of medical bills through the surgeries and care Garrett is receiving at Baylor Grapevine. Once Garrett is well enough for rehab, there will be expenses associated with this care for years to come. Please help us rally around Garrett and the Lambert family by helping to alleviate some of the medical and hospital bills by donating to Garrett's Go Fund Me.Please continue to pray for Garrett and his family in this time of uncertainty. Garrett needs a miracle from the Lord and healing brought to his body from the injuries and the pneumonia.Read more"

Transverse myelitis is an inflammation of both sides of one section of the spinal cord. This neurological disorder often damages the insulating material covering nerve cell fibers (myelin). In Alexa's case she became paralyzed and was not able to walk 2 weeks after her 21st birthday, last October 2016. This vibrant, energetic soul is fighting this rare battle that most of us will never understand! She was attending her 2nd year in college and working full time, at a famous clothing store on 5th Avenue!! Life was going in the right direction for this 21-year-old. It was a Friday, her day off, she was getting ready to pick up her check and run errands. Suddenly, she fell to the floor and could not move her legs, arms or torso!! 911 was called, Alexa was admitted to the hospital, she has remained immobile since that day. Alexa could no longer walk, move her legs, her arms, toes or fingers. Her life dramitacally changed in a matter of seconds. This young person full of life with no medical conditions, suddenly was faced with this illness. Throughout this past year she has been transferred to some of the best hospitals and rehabilitation centers here in NYC and insurance has ran to its max, with limited therapy sessions. She has been fighting this rare disease, since that fateful day.Her mother, Maria has left her job to fully care for her and assist her in all needs. Maria, her husband Yeral, along with their 11-year-old son Franciel, have alternated their life to assist Alexa in every possible way. Alexa has been living at home for a few months now with a hospital bed and a wheelchair after living in the hospital for many long agonizing months,receiving nothing but short answers yet, the best care. Again, Alexa continues to receive therapy, but it is not enough, as insurance company only covers so much. Upon her own research to find other avenues of assistance to walk again, she has found Project Walk, a place where there is advanced technology and resources that are not available in nearby NYC hospitals. Project Walk is cash based or financial assistance via some non-profit organizations. Whilst, I say this vibrant, young woman doesn't stop, she has started her own baking business from her home!! She has had a love for baking and cooking since we can all remember, always making the family delicious cakes, treats and appetizers!! We started this gofundme on her behalf to help take care of some expenses and specifically initiate the services of Project Walk Rehab center which is a 2-hour drive from her home!! Alexa is determined to walk again...with the help of family, friends as well as random caring individuals who can relate to this life changing event, it will be possible. Contributions will most certainly be appreciated and will go a very long way so that these funds can help Alexa move forward on this long journey!

TIRR is part of Memorial Hermann Hospital, and is considered one of, if not, the best neurological rehab and research hospital in the U.S.  Ben is truly blessed to be cared for in such an amazing place, and it is obvious that God continues to provide only the best for him as he begins his road to recovery.Although Benjamin is out of ICU, it is still best for him to have limited visitors. Too much stimulation can both excite and exhaust him. For this reason, we ask that you contact Claire or Brittany before you make plans to visit. Rest assured, Ben would love to see all of you when the timing is right, and we pray that the time for such visits is not too far away!We continue to offer thanks and praise to God for all of your kind thoughts and abundant generosity. We ask that you please keep Ben and Brittany in your daily prayers, as they faithfully travel the path of rehabilitation together.Thanks, and God bless you all...Update #3 on Ben: Third Brain Surgery Completed...Tuesday, August 1st, 10:00amYesterday was another great day for Benjamin! You may not think having another surgery in his brain could be so wonderful, but when the results are all positive, it truly is a great day! Ben's third brain surgery implanted an internal shunt which will allow for the drainage of fluid preventing the build up of cranial pressure. His external drain was also removed during the procedure. This surgery will further stabilize his condition and move Ben toward rehab, PT and OT more quickly. His doctors were extremely pleased with the results and are now discussing his transfer out of ICU and into a step-down unit!Again, all of these positive steps would not be happening without your continuous faithful prayers.  We cannot begin to express our gratitude for your expressions of love and support for Benjamin. Words are never enough, but for now its all we have...Thank you all so very much,With love, Claire, Brittany, Dominic and EvieUpdate #2 on Ben: Post Heart Surgery News...Tuesday, August 1st, 9:00amDear Friends, thank you for your prayers, they are being ansswered! As mentioned previously, Ben received heart surgery last week to repair his Aorta and Aortic Heart Valve. That procedure went extremely well and Ben was gifted with both a donor Aortic stem and valve. This was a tremendous blessing in that these human organs will be accepted much more readily by Ben's body and they will also last much longer for his long-term health. Ben's heart surgeons were delighted with the results! Since his heart surgery, Ben's overall condition has stabilized significantly and he has shown more energy and responsiveness! Please keep the prayers going! We thank God for your most generous gifts!Update on Ben: Heart Surgery this morning...Tuesday, July 25th, 7:30amBen was just brought back for surgery to repair his Aorta and to replace his Aortic Heart Valve. While Ben has experienced a few small advances, his condition continues to be critical. His surgeons have determined that he is stable enough to proceed with the heart surgery that must be done to correct the heart problems that led to his brain anuerysms. Please keep Ben in your prayers throughout this day as he fights through the next set of challenges he faces. We greatly appreciate your powerful prayers, and your overwhelming generosity...Original Post, Tuesday, July 18th...In the early morning hours of Monday, July 17th, while awaiting surgery to replace an infected aortic heart valve, Ben suffered multiple ruptured brain aneurysms which have resulted in current right side paralysis, and diminished cognitive and motor skills. Ben is currently in critical condition and being cared for in the neurologic ICU ward of Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, Texas. His prognosis is uncertain, and while currently fighting the toughest battle of his life, he is also still in need of the critically important heart valve replacement surgery which has now been postponed.Ben is only 33 years old, having celebrated his birthday on Easter Sunday of this year. He is a 2002 graduate of St. Thomas More Catholic High School and a 2007 graduate of UL. Ben and his wife Brittany have two beautiful children, three year old Dominic, and one year old Evelyn.Your donations will help relieve the burden of the extensive medical expenses Ben has incurred, and the future cost of his continued long term care, and much needed heart valve surgery.Thank you for your kind gifts and prayers.Read more"

Anyone who knows Thomas knows of his great love and faith in God, what follows is nothing short of a miracle. On September, 7th 2019 Thomas Craig took off from Henderson Executive Airport in Las Vegas en route back home to San Diego. Due to unforeseen circumstances the crew needed to turn around. Suddenly, the plane plummeted about a half mile from the airport and crashed. A fire occurred and as it blazed, a Good Samaritan Angel helped an individual stumbling from the wreckage on fire. That person was Thomas, whom we all love so deeply. The extent of the damage was severe, 2nd and 3rd degree burns cover nearly 75% of his body. While he fights to recover in the burn trauma unit, his friends and family arrived to support him from Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Sacramento, Fredericksburg, New York, Denver, Honolulu, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City, to name a few. His loved ones gathered in the burn unit with hearts in hand. Thomas will have to endure multiple surgeries, multiple skin grafts, and many months, possibly years of rehab.He will need to remain in Las Vegas for the time being where family and friends do not reside. It will be a long, steep, uphill battle until we can bring him home. Lodging and daily expenses build as the treatments occur. Thomas has an infectious personality using words as bridges to connect with others and for that he is adored as is evidenced by the growing support outside his door. Thomas’ favorite DC superhero is The Green Lantern, known for using will power and creativity to wield a lantern ring. Thomas did the same in making his dream come true by becoming a pilot. We look to you to aid in his recovery through a small donation or message of well wishes. We thank you for your support, prayers, and generosity! Please share our #FlyinHawaiian SUPERHERO story!At this time, Thomas Craig VII (Thomas's father), will act as the beneficiary for all donations. Mahalo!Read more"

That was October 16th and after spending over 13+ days in the hospital we have prayed a lot for a strong recovery.As she has always been a strong single mother, it hasn’t been easy for her to loose the ability to control her left side of her body. It is going to take some time to regain the strength to walk and use her own hands to take care of herself independently. For the indefinite future I will be there right by her side until she is healthy.Being only 22, I have had a steep learning curve when it comes to handling family medical situations. Luckily my Mom does have insurance, but still medical expenses and bills are on the verge of piling up.I am so grateful to have had my grandmother and boyfriend fly out from across the county to support my Mom and I. Also I am so glad to have the support and accommodation of the Syraucse University community in this time of struggle.Anyone’s donation, even the smallest amount would help with our tight situation as she heads into inpatient rehab to regain her mobility and can’t work for the time being.Read more"

A kind, gentle and brilliant boy, that I have the honour of calling my son. Keygan, his little brother Quintin and I arrived home in the afternoon from a two day camping trip not far from home. It was 3am when Keygan came into my room and woke me to complain of a headache, this was out of the ordinary, even with his medical history.In 2017, on Keygans 14th birthday he was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma and endured 6 rounds of chemotherapy. November 2020 will mark three years clear of Cancer and will continued to be monitored for years. I tucked Keygan into bed with a glass of water, went to bed, it was only about 5 minutes and I had an overwhelming need to check on him. Keygan was on the floor beside his bed, unresponsive and appeared to be having a seizure. My heart began to raced and my adrenaline kicked into overdrive.Keygan was rushed to Victoria General Hospital by ambulance, as I followed behind crying, shaking with fear and panic. Keygan was rushed into a CT scan before I was allowed to see him again. The results showed a major bleed was happening in Keygans brain and cutting off oxygen the oxygen supply. The Neurosurgeon on call told me over the phone, 'the bleed is far too extensive to have hope for survival, I'm sorry'. He went on to explain even if he were to preform a craniotomy, Keygan would most likely not live to complete that surgery. These words stirred a feeling like no other.I pushed for the surgery. Keygan underwent a five hour surgery, removing a major portion of his skull to access the artery that was flooding his brain with blood. He survived and made it into the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit!!! The neurosurgeon found nothing obvious to explain how or why this happened. The blood vessel was clamped and 57 stitches closed the skin and the 'bone flap' was left off to allow for swelling. Keygan was now in a medical induced coma, on a breath machine and being cooled to decrease swelling.The doctors and neurosurgeon sat me down in the quiet room and said ""Keygan was not out of the woods, the damage to his brain was extensive and he still may die as his brain swells."" :'(The danger window of three days later passed and then another three days and then another 3 days. I hear repeatedly that Keygan was not out of the woods yet as he may not be able to breath on his own, and he probably wont be able to hear, speak or walk ever again. Another surgery to insert a feeding tube into his stomach, remove his braces (in preparation for an MRI) and to drained fluid that was pooling on the side of his skull where the flap would normally hold it in. Keygans sedation was then lighted in preparation of extubation, the next day the team gathered to ensure Keygan would have back-up if he was unable to take in air on his own. He did it! He took breaths!!! As did I! The fluid on the side of his head was back after a few days, so they drained it again in a procedure room with a local.Another hard part, withdrawal from the drugs that his body was now addicted to. Keygan was feed through his gtube and picked up out of bed in with an overhead lift.Day by day he slept a little less and started making eye contact. Still unable to move or communicate, it had been 21 days and Keygan was stable enough to move out of Intensive Care and into acute care. As Keygan became less medicated, he tried to communicate and it was so hard! He was awake inside his mind, but unable to make his voice work. I had told Keygan a few times during his conscious moments about why he was in the hospital and what had happened inside his brain. He was pretty upset about all of his hair he had worked so hard to grow after chemo made him bald and now he was bald again. It was so painful to see his sadness and frustration when he had something to say or tried to communicate with medical staff. He was determined to eat and drink, so we worked on it together. We watched YouTube videos about swallowing after a brain injury and he just kept at it and eventually he was eating muffins.There was a swallow test scheduled but it was weeks after Keygan was ready.Soon after the test, he refused feeds by gTube, it was clear, it needed to be removed.
The MRI results were promising and the brain surgeon was ready to operate and replace the bone flap. The many many stitches were removed two weeks later. As days went on Keygan was just done with it all. He didn't want to participate in conversations with medical staff and was just so down. Rightly so. I had to get my baby home even if it was for a day. We worked at it and a few days later he was given an over night pass.
Really, our sights were set on Sunny Hill in Vancouver for intense rehabilitation. After a few days with overnight passes, we were discharged for the weekend and Sunny Hill was ready to except us on Monday September 21.Packing up to leave home again was challenging. It was hard for Keygan. It was hard for Quintin. I feel torn in two when I have to choose a child and this ugly feeling is familiar. When Keygan was an inpatient for chemotherapy I was unable to be with Quintin for a week at a time. It breaks my heart that I can't do it all.These brothers really love one another! Quintin is at home in Victoria with his 'Step-up Dad' Tim, a long time family friend that has stepped up to fill in where I can't. Keygan and I are here at Sunny Hill in Vancouver Children's Hospital. Working on our third week of intense rehab and therapies.Keygan is AMAZING. He wakes up at 7am and tries so hard to help get himself ready for the day. He puts his best foot forward while trying to learn to take steps. He practices his speech therapy even when that session is over. He is asked 10 times a day how he slept, how he's eating. He is repeatedly assessed and vitals taken, masked faces are in and out of his room all day long. Some people talk to him like he can't hear, some write things down and speak slowly. It's so hard as a mother to witness how upsetting it is for Keygan, I feel powerless most of the time. Keygan takes deep breaths all day and does everything he's asked to do. And handles it all with such grace and acceptance.Keygan is doing amazing with rehab. He thrives on standing up tall and when he started to take steps, the smile on his face brought tears to my eyes. Keygan has been granted a pass to visit home over Thanksgiving weekend and couldn't be more thankful!! I'm so thankful we LIVE! And in such an amazing place and that Keygan is getting better, and that one day we'll all be home again and the bad days will be stories of perseverance and triumph!!!Why did I created this GoFundMe? For Keygan!!! For now and for his future. To give him freedom, small escapes, piece of mind and micro celebrations. To get Sushi out and pizza in. Long drives around Vancouver to get out of the hospital. Keygan loves Subway. He will need accessible clothing that he can put on more easily with his splints and brace, one handed. New apps to help him adapt and stay connected. Vitamins and healthy food and snacks to add to the hospital meals. Little can add up to lots.Thank you very much for reading our story and supporting us in any way you can.Keygan will need things in his future that will help him get back to his life and this money will go in Trust and be spent as his needs become more clear.Again, thank you.

Resilience. Hope. These are words that describe 16 year old Haley Ramirez and the journey she has been on since being involved in a terrible vehicular accident in mid-August in Clarksdale. Just minutes after the accident occured, Haley found herself floating in and out of consciousness, unable to move or feel anything in her body.Shortly after arriving at the hospital, Haley was immediately flown to Region One Health Medical Center in Memphis. Haley suffered an incomplete spinal cord injury during the accident, leaving her paralyzed. She requires a tracheotomy due to the impairment of her respiratory system and paralysis of the respiratory muscles. She battled pneumonia while in the ICU at “The Med”. She was transported to Batson Children’s hospital in Jackson, MS on September 25. Her most promising progress came during her two weeks at Methodist Rehab in Jackson. She was able to regain control of some of her toes and her left arm, but insurance coverage quickly ran out and Haley's family found themselves back at home with a bedridden daughter, a long road ahead, and no plan for how Haley would get the care she needs.An avid athlete, Haley grew up playing youth softball until she was 14 and aged out of the league. She continued her athletic career at Lee Academy, spending time playing softball, running track, playing tennis, basketball, and faithfully standing on the sidelines at Colt Field cheering for the Lee Academy Colts. Haley was constantly on the move with friends until everything came to a full halt the night of the accident.Right now Haley spends most of her time either in bed or in the power wheelchair that enables her to move around. Haley is unable to sit up, much less walk, and is completely dependent on others. Haley might be immobilized right now, but this is not where she belongs.With brain and spinal cord injuries, timing is essential for recovery and restoration. Every day that Haley is unable to get back to rehab, the road to recovery becomes more difficult. “When you have a spinal cord injury, it is critical to receive early rehabilitation to prevent disability and complications. The treatment and rehabilitation process for spinal cord injury is long, expensive, and requires a multi-disciplinary approach"" shared family friend and registered physical therapist Darlene Crumpton.Haley needs to resume her rehab in Jackson as soon as possible, but the out-of-pocket cost for this specialized treatment is over $2,000 a day. Methodist Rehab has programs and staff that work specifically with patients who have suffered spinal cord injuries similar to Haley’s. The near future goal is for Haley to be able to spend 8 weeks at Methodist Rehab, but without insurance, Haley’s family needs to come up with $112,000 to make this a reality. The immediate goal is for Haley to get back on her road to recovery by spending a week in Jackson, with fundraising efforts to follow that would allow her to continue her stay. Haley’s family’s first goal is to raise the cost of that first week of therapy by November 2.Haley’s attitude and outlook during these last two months have been nothing but positive. Her mother Laura asked her how she was able to remain so hopeful through all of this and she mouthed just one word: “God”. Haley was supposed to be confirmed at St. Elizabeth Catholic Church this fall, but things have not gone as planned. However, it is Haley’s faith, her resilience, her hope, and the support and prayers of friends, family, and even complete strangers that will see her through to healing.Please consider going “All In For Haley” and supporting her rehab and recovery. Haley needs $14,000 by November 2 to resume her critical therapy and every dollar beyond that all the way to and past the goal of $112,000 makes her chances of full recovery even greater.For more on Haley's journey, visit www.allinforhaley.comRead more"

Por otro lado, Luego de la cirugia es que me haran un pet scan para ver si ya estoy sanada o debo continuar con mas tratamiento, q esperemos q no.Thanks Gracias Obrigada Grazie MerciDamos inicio a está campaña, por nuestra amiga y compañera Stephanie Carolina Abdelnour Suárez, la cual, se encuentra, en el Hospital General de la ciudad de México, hospitalizada, bajo tratamiento médico,el motivo es que presenta Cáncer de tipoLinfoma de hodgkin, un linfoma se le alojó en la columna vertebral, fracturando 7ma y 8va vertebra de la columna dorsal y presionado los nervios, por tal motivo, no puede caminar actualmente y debe someterse a principios de Abril a cirugia de columna. Solo los tornillos y placas que necesita cuestan cerca de 3.500$usd.Luego de 5 radioterapias comprimidas y 2 quimios tipo ICE BEAM esperamos resultados de un pet scan para saber si Stephanie debe continuar con este tratamiento o necesita una quimio especial llamada Brentuximanb, la cual cuesta cerca de 4mil $usd. Esto depende de como ha reaccionado al tratamiento.Sus amigos, allegados y familiares, creamos este fondo, ya que no contamos con los recursos para costear todo lo que el tratamiento y gastos médicos implican. Acudiendo a la buena fé y apostando a que en la unión está la fuerza. Creamos este fondo de donaciones para que con un granito de arena, de cada uno, construyamos el castillo que podrá costear todos los gastos asociados a la enfermedad ( radios, quimios, hospitalización, terapias, y todo lo concerniente al caso ). Agradeciendo... mil gracias y bendecidos sean por toda la ayuda que nos puedan brindar para lograr entre todos la pronta y total sanación de Stephanie. Amén!
We start this campaign for our friend and companion Stephanie Carolina Abdelnour Suárez, who is in the General Hospital of Mexico City, hospitalized, under medical treatment.The reason is that she presents Cancer of type Hodgkin's lymphoma, alymphoma lodged in the spine, fractured the 7thing and 8the vertebrae of the dorsal column and pressed the nerves, for such reasons she is not currently able to walk. Stephanie is going to get column surgery in beggining of April. Only the screws and stuff needed for it cost around 4.000$usd.After had received 5 compressed radiotherapies and 2 chemos type ICE BEAM we are waiting for results of a pet scan to know if Stephanie should continue with the normal treatment or if she needs a special chemo called Brentuximanb which cost around 4.000$usd. This will depend on the evolution.Her friends and relatives have created this fund, since we do not have the resources to pay for everything that the treatment and medical expenses imply. Going to the good faith and betting that in the union is the force,we create this fund of donations to achieve that with a grain of sand of each, we build the castle that can cover all the expenses associated with the disease (radios, chemo, hospitalization, therapies, and everything related to the case).Grateful, a thousand thanks and blessings to all for the help that you all can offer us to achieve among all us the prompt and total healing of Stephanie.

At that time, she was a normal third-year student at the Polytechnic Institute of NYU, working towards a degree in Mechanical engineering, who had her whole life ahead of herself. Then, tragedy struck. That year, she lost her closest cousin to a motorcycle accident. Due to the trauma, she had a seizure. The ensuing hospital visit led to even more bad news: Prasha was diagnosed with scleroderma, an autoimmune rheumatic disease targeting connective tissues. Scleroderma hardened her arms and hands until they became scaly. It tightened her skin until her fingers curled like bony, immovable claws. It caused her intense joint pain from her arms to her legs. Her doctors saddled her with a bleak outlook, telling her she would probably never lead a normal life. It would be filled with doctors’ appointments, treatments, medication, and pain. Also, they told her, she would never have kids, which was a devastating blow to her spirit. After the initial shock and dismay passed, Prasha’s inner fortitude shone through. She decided to enjoy her life to the best of her ability. She made a bucket list. She traveled. She visited old friends and made new ones. Those experiences made her happier and were a reprieve from her daily medical horror. She met her husband, Dipak, a wonderful guy supported through her sickness. Miraculously, she got pregnant. Prasha’s pregnancy was one of the most complicated pregnancies. She was told to terminate even at the fifth month due to the risk to the mother’s body. Yet, she persevered. Jolene was born after seven months of gestation, a premie but healthy. However, their happy story ended on a bitter note when her lungs failed the very next day. Prasha flatlined; she was on the precipice of death. She said she felt so close that she didn’t feel any pain. Fortunately, her doctors were able to rescue her.Her rescue wasn’t a panacea, though. In October 2013, she was diagnosed with Pulmonary Fibrosis. The scleroderma had spread to her lungs, leading to Pulmonary Fibrosis. Pulmonary Fibrosis is when your lungs tissue change into scar tissue, making each breath difficult. She was put on oxygen and given a 2-5 year prognosis. Her only hope for a full recovery was a double lung transplant. She was rejected twice due to the severity of her scleroderma. In February 2014, she was diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension where even with supplementary oxygen, her body was not getting sufficient oxygen. Hope waned, but she did not give up. Finally, in December 2014, she was listed for a double lungs transplant. Then, it was a waiting game - going to the doctor’s appointments, therapies, avoiding sickness until the call came. The wait was difficult. There were many restrictions on her life. She lost her independence; always hooked up to a green oxygen tank always and a hovering aide, nearby. She lost a toe to gangrene. But she did not lose hope. After more than a year on the waitlist, on February 9th, 2016, Prasha received her gift of life - her double lung transplant. The surgery was a success. We are forever thankful to Melissa (the name that Prasha gave for her donor) and her family. Meanwhile, after three months of recovery, she left the hospital and returned home in April 2016. Prasha cherished every moment of her new life, vowing to make good use of the precious miracle she had been granted. First, she became stronger. She was punctual about her doctors’ appointments and followed their advice. She meticulously organized her plethora of medication. She regularly attended pulmonary rehab to strengthen her lungs. Her first-year post-transplant was dedicated to her health. Then, making good on her promise to not waste her new lungs, Prasha continued her work as an organ donation advocate and a community leader for those affected by scleroderma and pulmonary fibrosis and hypertension. Prior and post-transplant, she volunteered for organ donation and has been involved in fundraising events. She is committed to making her voice heard about pulmonary fibrosis, scleroderma and many more. She went to Capitol Hill in 2018 with her husband to meet with New York State representatives to raise awareness and fundraising for this disease. More recently, she has spoken at various seminars, sharing her incredible life journey and inspiring those who are similarly affected. These last three year after transplant, Prasha has been very active and productive, advocating for what she always believed in.Her new lungs also gave her the opportunity to be a mother to her beloved five-year-old, Jolene, a loving and supporting wife to Dipak, and a sister and a daughter to her family. Through her dedication to raising awareness, Prasha’s efforts are not only known to her family, but also to the larger community. She is known as a lung warrior, fighter and community advocate. We want to thank everyone following her journey and supporting her for the past couple of years.We were very excited to celebrate her third anniversary this year. Unfortunately, on December 16th, 2018, Prasha was hospitalized due to a high fever after her monthly IVIG treatment. She has been admitted to the New York Presbyterian Medical Intensive care unit (ICU) where she has been given treatment for rejection, infections and several other complications for the last 7 weeks. She is currently on ECMO, ventilator and dialysis machine. Her lungs and kidney are deteriorating. The scarring in her lungs has returned. Prasha’s best chance at recovery is a second lung transplant as well as a kidney transplant. We are working hard to relist her. We need your support to help Prasha stand on her own again. The last time, it was only with your help that Prasha was able to fight for her life. We are very grateful to the medical team at NYP as they have constantly provided Prasha with best care and support. We believe she can make it again. Her spirit is still strong. We would like your support for listing Prasha for a second lung transplant and kidney transplant. We still have HOPE FOR PRASHA and for Jolene to see her mother. We love her and hope you could join us to make her next chapter possible. Looking for a miracle, Regards,Prasha TuladharTeam Hope For PrashaRead more"

And I still think ""really, a stroke"" and why do such things happen to the best? I generated a flyer, which I posted at both facilities where I work...exposing very personal details of our friendship, including photos that sharedour time together in Philadelphia with my son Christian and photos of my wedding to my husband Christopher, that were taken by Elzer - My Best man, our best man. I shared details about my friend suffering a stroke to my colleagues who don't know him....and I said within my flyer (or better yet, another way to reach good people with good hearts)... ""why do I tell you all of this, why do I tell you things that are so personal to me"", because THAT is what you do for a true friend, and Elzer is that to me and to my husband who instantly ""clicked"" with Elzer, and now to my son who finally met Elzer on Thanksgiving and instantly adored him! Since we were very young Elzer has been a self-taught brilliant photographer...took some brilliant photos of me, capturing my youth and capturing my wedding, capturing some of the best and worst times of my life. As the years passed, Elzer's talent only grew and he is meant to continue to follow his passion, his work as a photographer. So it is my plea to Elzer's true ""friends"" or even just those who care for someone who is a true friend to help us reach our humble goal. I have been amazed by how many of my friends and colleagues who have never met my friend Elzer who donated without a second thought because they either know him through me or as my one darling friend put it ""what matters to you matters to me"" xoxo! I am blown away by our mutual friends from high school or the club days who stepped up without question, and for my family who jumped to help my friend. YOU are all amazing. Let's please continue to pull together and give anything at all to get Elzer out of rehab (was in ICU for 5 days and live in rehab since and I hate the thought of that) and back to his life, his passions, back behind his camera....and help get that left dimple back! If everyone gave just a little we would blow our goal out of the water. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart for what you've given so far WE ARE HALF WAY THERE in 13 days, let's make it all the way for Elzer or for a friend who loves Elzer as much as I do and my family does, as much as our mutual friends do and Elzer's friends and family do!! xoxoRead more"

June 4th was the day Carley had been looking forward to for months. It was the first day of her trip to Belize. Instead of a relaxing day of vacation, June 4th ended up being the day Carley nearly died.  Carley, an elite swimmer, dove into the ocean, just like she had a thousand times before.  This time was different. Her head struck a sandbar and she broke her neck.   She floated to the surface and couldn’t move.  While her friends quickly swam to retrieve her, all she could think about was her 4 year old son, Jonny. She was in a third world country where even basic medical care is hard to come by.  She was placed on a beach chair with a towel around her neck for support and taken by open air cab to San Pedro.The care offered in San Pedro would not be sufficient, so while still on a beach chair with her neck supported by a towel, she was flown from San Pedro to Belize City. Once in Belize it was determined that surgery there would not be an option. Twenty hours after her accident she was finally back in the United States receiving medical treatment. The next day she underwent surgery. An opening was made in the front of her neck to access her spine where a metal plate was inserted to fuse her C4 through C6 vertebrae.   Word came; she made it through surgery and was alive.  Alive, but with paralysis in her legs and very limited movement with her arms.  Carley needed to be home, in Denver, close to her son, family and friends.  Her parents arranged for a medical transport from Miami to Denver where she could get the best care possible. The $20,000 flight however was not covered by insurance. She is working daily with occupational and physical therapists while at Craig Rehabilitation hospital.  Her doctors say she needs a minimum of 90 days of rehabilitation but her insurance only pays for 60 days.  The 30 days insurance won’t cover will cost $90,000 and after her stay at Craig, the bills don’t stop. This will be a lifelong challenge.  She needs your help, your strength, your positivity and your faith.  These will help Carley keep up the good fight, but more importantly, she needs financial support. Carley is a fighter, and she is determined to walk again, but the prognosis remains uncertain.  Carley’s mind and spirit are as strong as they come and she will face the challenges head on as she has with everything else in her life.  Her determination and positive attitude will help but she needs your support.    Carley is a single mom of an adorable four year old boy named Jonny.  She also is at the front end of an amazing career in medical devise sales and is coincidently the product manager for their spine division.  She needs the crucial therapy she is receiving at Craig Hospital so she can get back to her son and her career as they were before her accident.    Money is needed for:* The $20,000 medical evacuation flight insurance wouldn’t cover  * The $90,000 of care needed at Craig Rehabilitation Hospital (one of the best spinal and brain injury rehabilitation facilities in the world),* Wheelchair ramps and other modifications to her home* Required, extended outpatient care.* A vehicle modified to support wheelchair accessThe list goes on and on. Every dollar helps her continue her quest to walk again.  Every dollar signifies a better future for Carley, a future where she will soar.

Wendy needs rehab to learn to walk again, and has had multiple  surgeries to have shunts placed in her brain to control fluids, requiring ICU, which adds to the costs.  This week Wendy will be starting another round of chemotherapy, administered by IV, along with a newer drug, to attempt to control the aggressive, fast growing tumor. Along with intensive therapy to get her mobility back. Anyone who knows Wendy Smith and her family, knows they are the first to help anyone.  As a teacher for 19 years in Duneland, she has touched so many families and given so much to our community.  Wendy is one of the kindest and most caring souls you will ever meet.  Even as her diagnosis was being delivered and a treatment plan was being formed, she was spreading joy and more worried about others than herself.  She continues to touch lives and make people laugh through her blog and posts during this most challenging time. Her positive attitude and smile are infectious, and she has not stopped fighting.The medical bills are growing daily and are already astronomical.  Please consider a monetary donation to help Wendy and her family through this extremely challenging time.  The money raised will be used for the growing medical bills, commuting back and forth to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, rehab, and to purchase Wendy a special bike.  Wendy is not mobile right now, but she can ride this bike which costs around $2000 which will help build her strength.Wendy would like everyone to know she will be naming the bike, ""JOY"".  We have no doubt ""Joy"" will be a positive influence in Wendy's daily rehab and being much joy. Over the years, our community has done wonderful things for families in need, and Wendy needs this community’s help right now.  Please consider donating and giving back to Wendy and her family.  Together, we can help remove some of the financial burden for the family so that Wendy and her family can focus on her health.  Please give and also share this with others close and afar. Your gift is so greatly appreciated.Read more"

They just got Winston about a month ago as an 8 week old puppy, and have just loved him so much from the very beginning. He is such a playful puppy so they were so excited when they were finally cleared by the vet for Winston to go to the dog park when he had all his shots. About 15 minutes into his first dog park visit, we heard him make a bone-chilling noise, so we rushed over to where he was playing with a couple other dogs. We didn't see any blood, but we saw him holding his leg at an odd angle, so we assumed he had a dislocation. We rushed him to the emergency pet clinic and a few hours later they shared the awful news that Winston had actually broken his front right humerus bone in two places. Because of the location of the breaks, Luke & David were given the impossible decision of: 1) getting the surgery, which is SUPER expensive, 2) amputating the leg (still expensive), or 3) putting him down. They sought a few more opinions and finally found an orthopedic vet specialist in Madison who was confident they would be able to do the surgery. They will be driving Winston to Madison tomorrow, he'll get the surgery on Wednesday, and then he'll have to start rehab on Thursday. We are all so grateful that the surgeon thinks he'll be able to fix the breaks, but it's going to be a long road of recovery for Winston and his dads. It is also going to be an astronomical expense (the surgery alone was estimated at $15-20K) that they weren't expecting, all because of a freak accident at the dog park one Saturday morning.We know there is so much going on in the world, and so much you could donate money to, but Luke and David are truly the kindest humans and just want to give Winston the best life.

Prognosis is grim !! Before 1st August 2017, I didn't even know what these words exactly mean but since then I have heard these very words were spoken to me countless times by many medical professionals.

The tragedy struck our happy family on 1st August 2017 when my husband Jyandeep (Age 38, also known as JD among friends and family) drowned in the pool in the backyard of our very new house. On that fateful day, Jyandeep was working from home and during his break he decided to take the girls ( Age 7 and 2 ) for a quick swim in the pool.

What exactly happened is all blur as just the girls were with him . JD was not an expert swimmer, he just drowned. The little girls had no idea what was going on , why their Daddy is in the bottom of the pool. 

As soon as my 7 year old sensed that there is something wrong, she called me at work and i was able to call 911. When the first responders came, Jyandeep had no pulse , no breath. But with God's grace they were able to resuscitate him.

What followed next was beyond my worst nightmares. JD had sustained massive Anoxic brain injury and was in induced coma for 18 days and any attempt to bring him out of it were failing. The doctors said his chance of making it were not even 1% and were asking me again and again to ""Make a decision"".I decided to place our lives in the hand of God and prayed to him for a miracle. On Aug 18th 2017 , while on ventilator and in coma ,he was moved to another hospital not far from here and his medication for induced coma were stopped immediately. By God's Grace he opened his eyes and looked at me on 26th August 2017. I can never forget that moment- so full of hope for us.


Even after opening his eyes, Jyandeep remains in vegetative state till date since there was a substantial tissue loss from his brain. He was moved to an acute rehab and then to a nursing home, where he currently resides. 

Jyandeep got critically ill again in Jan 2018 and Jun 2018 when i thought i lost him but God saved him both times. Prayers of our loved ones and the blessings of God are why we still have him to love.

Currently, Jyandeep resides in a nursing home near us which gives me the ability to visit him everyday and spend time with him when the girls are at school. He has no purposeful movements but he opens his eyes spontaneously and also look at somebody when they speak to him . His greatest reactions come when the girls visit him in the evening and weekends. He seems calm and happy.

I was able to bring him home on his birthday for a little celebration and for the first time since that fateful day, i saw couple of tears roll down his eyes, he looked happy to be home , even if it was for couple of hours. No matter what the doctors and therapists say, he is there and he is NOT like a vegetable.



The next step in his recovery would be to bring him home and surround him with love 24X7. The hugs and kissed from the girls and the constant chatter may help in his recovery. This will prove to be very challenging as i don't have any family around to help. To be honest, i am super scared. With faith in my God to give me strength, i am working towards it and getting trained on all the aspects of his care so that i can take care of him at home.

The most challenging part for us would be the financial sustainability for the next 2-3 years as i want to be with him at home taking care of him and helping with his recovery. There would be no sense leaving him with a nurse while i am out for 8-9 hours working. My decision to not work for next 2-3 years might be good for him but it is a crazy decision to make financially as I have a mortgage and medical bills to be paid apart from making sure our 2 little girls are well provided for.

For his past bills, I had applied for Medicaid assistance from the State of New York in Jul 2018 and was hoping that the Medicaid would pay the bills for Jyandeep from April 2018 onward but their decision is to start from April 2019. This has left us with an year worth of unpaid bills totaling over 160K USD to be paid, mostly to the nursing home.

There are two lines of treatment that I am considering for him in the near future - HBOT ( Hyper Baric Oxygen Treatment) and Cold Laser but they are not covered by insurance . Although there is no literature validating the efficiencies of these treatments in brain injury, there have been stories of significant recovery for other patients in similar situation. Each of these might cause upwards of 20K USD.

I am requesting you to support our family in these difficult time and help raise 300K USD to help pay his past medical bills, try new medical treatments not covered by insurance, make home modifications and get necessary medical equipments to bring him home and help us sustain over next 2 years or so.

Jyandeep and God have teamed up to defy the medical prognosis again and again and i believe that my miracle will come over time. 

With Love and Faith in God,

NandnaRead more"

Poor boy was crying in pain...I drove him to the emergency hospital and they confirmed his injury through an x-ray. For now they placed a splint on him limb but they advised that Charlie needs surgical repair.Emergency visit, medication he's on right now, x-ray and splint has cost me $860.31 out of pocket (since he doesn't have insurance) but the surgery that will take place on Tuesday, December 29 has an estimate of $4500-$6000, not including his rehab and medication post-surgery. If Charlie doesn't get his leg fixed, the doctor said there will be a possibility that his leg wont heal properly and amputation might be needed in the future which is NOT what my family wants.I completely understand that many are struggling due to the pandemic but I'm hoping to get any sort of assistance as I'm struggling too and can't afford to cover the cost without getting deeper in debt.Charlie-Roo is mine and my 6 year old's best friend.

However, he still has a lot of work to do in El Paso at his outpatient neural rehab facility and at their home in Alpine, Texas, to recover both physically and cognitively, and Jess remains by his side giving him that support. Unfortunately, this specialized outpatient care is not available in Alpine, so they must travel the 4 hours to El Paso weekly, and incur the expense of lodging and travel on top of accumulating medical costs.Jess has been managing their finances on a drastically cut income and with dramatically increased expenses, and they are in dire need of all of our help.

Unfortunately,as a self-employed musician living in the United States, my very dear friend Paul Marinaro is forced to live a very different reality.Paul has struggled with Diverticulutis for years. That condition has come with severe chronic pain, nausea, fever and extreme fatigue, along with considerable weight loss that can hit at any given moment. Those who are familiar with what he has struggled with have seen him push through this pain under unimaginable circumstances. Those who were not aware witnessed it whether they realized it or not. Paul has performedto sold out crowds while holding onto the piano to maintain his balance because he was having an attack. He has laid on the floor of backstage areas while the band plays the opening number. This has been going onfor years, and the pain, discomfort and inconvenience has only gotten worse, though he has always managed to maintain truly astonishing strength and integrity when it came to his performances. Why has he put up with this? Because as a citizen of the United States, he was unable to get the medical attention he needs without putting himself into major debt. Not just the debt of the surgery and hospital stay, but any materials necessary to his recovery, any homecare that may be needed, rehab and of course, the fact that he will be unable to work for months with no idea how he will manage to take care of his every day expenses.While Paul has managed (quite remarkably) to avoid the inevitable for many years, on December 22nd 2017, the inevitable and unavoidable happened. After years of chronic bouts, his weakened colonruptured, causing a massive infection and he became severly septic. Thankfully, he was able to get to the phone to call 911 and the ambulance took him to the hospital. By that afternoon they were working to save his life. With his family on a plane from Buffalo, and his dearest friend by his side, Paul was able to start what would be the biggest fight of his life.The best Christmas gift that any of us who love Paul could get is the news that the surgery was successful. The doctor informed us that this was the worst case he had seen in his 21+ years of being a general and vascular surgeon. Hearing him reiterate how close we all came to losing Paul was very jarring. Of course, we are all completely relieved that he is with us and starting his road to recovery.Now, the hard part. Paul has a long roadahead of him starting withrecovering from this first surgery, preparing for a needed second, recovering from that and then working his way back to the stage. He needs our help.Along with being one of the best people on the face of this earth, Paul has an incredible talent and has worked incredibly hard to build his career (especially over the last decade in Chicago), and in the last year has taken some huge strides. He made his New York City debut to a sold-out crowd at one of the most historic clubs in jazz history,Birdland(PAUL SINGING ""DEVIL MAY CARE"" AT BIRDLAND), performed with the legendarySheila Jordan for the 2017Chicago Jazz Festival to a crowd over over 10,000 peopleand has sold-out countless performances at the iconic venuesJazz Showcase (PAUL SINGING ""FOR ALL WE KNOW"" AT THE JAZZ SHOWCASE)andThe Green Mill (PAUL SINGING ""I AIN'T GOT NOTHIN' BUT THE BLUES"" AT THE GREEN MILL) .His 2013 debut album (a carefully created concept album in tribute to his Father) was met with widespread acclaim all over the US, and led to the beginning of a professional up-swing for Paul that would send him to various cities in the United States and to Canada, to share his talents with eager audiences.(PAUL AND JOSEPH MARINARO: ""YOU WILL BE MY MUSIC"")Paul belongs on stage. There are no two ways about it. It's his home. He is the perfect example of someone who was born to do this. Along with his god-given talent, he has put countless hours of work into continuously evolving as a singer. He has spent a large portion of his life dedicated to learning more about the music that he wants to sing. He is not in this for any reason other than the fact that he loves it, and he knows as much as anyone who has heard him sing, that this is what he is meant to do. Paul has some very big career opportunitiesscheduled for later in 2018, and he is using these dates as a goal to keep him motivated.Fiercly proud and independent, those of you who know Paul are well aware of how hard it is for him to accept help, let alone ask for it. I want you to know that he is awareof this campaign and has humbly consented to my organizing this. This is a very difficult thing for him, but he is very appreciative to everyone who has already reached out and asked how they can help.Please consider giving your support to someone who needs and deserves it. Paul has a very long road ahead of him, and wants nothing more than to be back on stage healthier than ever. He needs our help. Absolutely any donation is greatly appreciated.￼Read more"

Yes. There were moments of concern when she was younger that were to be expected, but all in all, she’s maintained, sustained, and her body has successfully compensated.March 11, 2019 is the date that would change all of that.

During this 9 day hospital stay, doctors performed a plethora of tests. Some routine, many diagnostic, to try to figure out the root cause of this major setback. Results ended up showing that in addition to her lung disease progressing, she also has moderately high pulmonary hypertension with her heart working much harder than it should. After no real success in initial treatments, it was then collectively decided that she needed to be at a bigger hospital with more targeted care and expertise. The hospital of choice was to be Mt. Sinai, the acclaimed satellite hospital to National Jewish Health Institute in Denver, Colorado. The number one pulmonary critical care hospital in the country.Now under the continuous care of a world-renowned pulmonary team, doctors and scientists are working diligently to still get answers to her mysterious disease; while keeping Frencesca as stable as possible. As stable as her body will allow. Doctors are handling her with kit gloves. Frencesca is completely oxygen dependent, using between 3-4 liters upon any excretion. Unfortunately, there have also been a few additional setbacks, including the very unexpected discovery of pulmonary embolisms following a cat scan, which resulted in the placement of a filter into her main vein as a precaution to prevent any future blood clots from traveling to her lungs or heart. Again, kit gloves.Doctors are adamant that all roads are leading to a double lung transplant. In fact, the process has begun. Frencesca was already approved for the first step in the transplant evaluation, and is also in the process of getting approved to begin a rigorous pulmonary rehab program in New York City. In just a few short weeks, we as a family will be meeting with the transplant team for the second part of the evaluation. The doctors want her to be at her optimum health for when she is a candidate to be on the transplant list.All of this shared, this is exactly why we are here. The expenses of the impending transplant alone are overwhelming to say the least. Frencesca is not working. The cost of living for her continues to mount. The cost of gas back and forth to the city each time. The hotels. The food. All of it. There’s just an incredibly long road ahead, and anything that you can give to lessen the burden is appreciated. There is power in numbers so even just spreading the word on this effort is more than we can ask for.With sincere love and gratitude,Frencesca and her Family.Read more"

Amidst the joy, any new parent knows how incredibly tough that first year is, but I'm still in shock from the year that we've had to face...

My name is Keitha Young and when I was 15 weeks pregnant I was suddenly and unexpectedly diagnosed with severe Crohn’s disease, then just days later, I had to have my whole colon removed in life-saving surgery.Miraculously and against so, so many odds my baby and I both survived.

Learning motherhood on top of all that we've gone through has been so testing, physically, emotionally and financially. Despite this, there are many moments of joy andto see Millie so healthy, we are continually grateful to have been blessed with such a resilient and brave daughter.But since we nearly died, multiple times, I’ve been struggling with both my physical and mental health as I face challenges every day, navigating Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Postnatal depression, managing this extremely severe case of Crohn’s disease and adjusting to theileostomy bag installed in our emergency surgery, all while trying to take the best care of our baby that I can...

And with my ongoing health battles, I fear for my future and what is in store for Millie, so I’ve resolved that I need to ask for your help.I’ve realised that I won’t get through this on my own and am reaching out humbly for financial support so that we can afford the treatments that will reset my immune system, getting me out of the danger zone and giving me a chance to get healthy again - so that I can be a better mama to Millie, not just barely surviving each day, but thriving once more.How did I lose my whole colon while pregnant?!!My case is globally unprecedented, so complex and would take more than I can begin to explain here, but briefly...After good health all my life, I went into my first trimester feeling vital and well, but in Week 14 suppressed immunity, which is normal in pregnancy, meant that I had an excruciating flare up of a common gut bacteria ‘C-diff’. I was admitted to hospital and quickly deteriorated, barely conscious in Intensive Care, some days painfully excreting up to half a litre of blood into a bedpan.We began fearing for our baby’s life and mine too.Two days later we received the shocking news that I had Crohn’s disease for which I’d had no awareness or previous symptoms, probably triggered out of remission by the C-diff flare.Then only three days later, I went into surgery. The surgeons had intended to only do keyhole surgery to see what the heck was going on but once inside me they saw that my large intestine had rapidly become so purple and gangrenous that it was falling apart, so they had to slice me down the middle to remove it.They said that if they hadn’t, the next day I would’ve died.We fought for our lives, for months...Millie and I survived - 50 days in hospital and several months of post-op rehab to follow, the gruelling details and stories from which I would need a whole book to do justice...Still, after all our suffering and fighting to be here, we made it against the odds to full term for the scheduled cesarean (to prevent damaging my remaining rectal stump) and I birthed our strong, brave daughter into this world.But it’s been so tough on our family since then and we really need your support now.

Your donations will help save my life. Truly.Mending my body + physical health.Since my inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) diagnosis we’ve learnt that it’s likely I have the worst case of Crohn’s in the country! To go from so healthy to this claim has been such a shock... But we’re starting to understand how environmental causes turned my immune system upside down during pregnancy when your immunity is particularly vulnerable.Crohn’s disease is an autoimmune condition with no known cause and no known cure (in modern medicine) and while curing the ‘incurable’ may seem like a huge undertaking, I’m determined to do it with the help of an incredible healing team who’ve given me hope that we can cure this, or at least significantly decrease my high odds of further surgery. I’m so grateful for modern medicine which truly saved our lives but I’m trying to change the prospect of a lifetime of immunosuppressant therapy which I’m currently on and the long term side effects of cancers, osteoporosis and more that can come with it. -(24 weeks pregnant, during our third stay in hospital)-Healing my heart + mental health.In a sad twist - with a new baby, with Brett caring for me and with me unable to work, we desperately need financial support from the government, but don’t get any as I’m a NZ citizen.And I’ve lost sleep for over 6 months about whether or not to crowdfund but recently realised that I HAD to, that it was a matter of life or death for me, when I had an episode of complete overwhelm and breakdown and was talking to my husband about leaving this life behind for the second time in a couple of months...It felt so cruel to have survived death and but then for life to feel too difficult to live...We have since sought help from Lifeline, our GP and health professionals and I’m feeling a lot more seen in my need to work through the many layers of PTSD, processing the dramatic changes to my body and life, along with the postnatal depression that I deal with on a daily basis while trying my best to care for Millie.So not only is my physical health on the line but my mental and emotional health have taken a huge toll.Still, with your help I truly believe we’re capable of mending my broken body and spirit.How your donations will be spent:By consulting a number of health professionals we’ve made a plan to use a combination of treatments to heal and reset my immune system, avoiding likely surgery and encouraging my body to function well again, even without its large intestine.These treatments also work on my mental and emotional body, healing the many layers of suffering, grief, loss and trauma that we’ve endured this past year, easing the weight of PTSD and postnatal depression.I know that they work as I worked with them to help me heal in 2016 (PTSD from sexual abuse when I was 7 years old) and they’ve already helped me so far on this journey, but we’re now out of funds and need your help to see them through.- Hakomi bodywork (2 weekly $100)- Acupuncture (2 weekly $90)- Counselling (2 weekly $50)- Biometer reading + remedies (monthly $150)- Herbal medicine, consults + inflammation management herbs ($200 month)For one year of treatments that’s around $15,000, but speaking to other folks who’ve healed their autoimmune conditions, it seems to be a journey of many years, so any additional funds raised will contribute to my ongoing longterm treatment and fight to get better.We also hope to be able to raise the funds for my immigration lawyer and Citizenship application fee (around $8,000) so that our family may be able to receive the financial support it needs during this rough patch before I return to health and can return to work.

Giving back...Those who know me know that I dedicate myself to work that I feel deeply passionate about from teaching organic gardening to children, to running Seed Freedom Food Festival, and I still dream of creating seed, herbal and food sovereignty programmes within refugee communities and marginalised groups. While my most important job right now is raising our daughter, know that in whatever way I can, I will always give back.So our family extends our deepest gratitude and appreciation for your donations that will help me to be here for those I love and those who I’m able to help.

Raising awareness...I’ve tried to be honest and authentic about this journey on my instagram page @thepeacefulseed, everything from the realities of living with PTSD, to ileostomy bag life, to postnatal depression, to ways that the garden helps heal us... and will continue to raise awareness on IBD, trauma and mental health as I’m able, including in public forums like sharing our journey at the Crohn's and Colitis Association of Australia info night this September and at the National Gastro conference next year.

Our endless gratitude!I can’t express how much you are saving our family with your kindness...Truly friends, thank you.Know that if you’re not able to cover one of my treatments, no donation is too small, every dollar counts to help me heal and we humbly accept whatever you can offer.And if you’re unable to donate then we’d still appreciate you sharing my story on with your friends and families who may be able to help ours.Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU dear ones, from the depths of our hearts.You are saving my life, giving me a chance to heal and giving Millie her mama.LOVE from the Young Clan,Keitha, Millie, Brett and Toffie xx

He suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury and had two emergency brain surgeries to relieve pressure in his skull, only days apart. He later had another surgery to place a shunt to allow the excess fluids to drain into his stomach. On October 5th, Danny was moved to TIRR Rehabilitation where he began Speech, Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy. Over the next three weeks Danny started to walk with assistance, converse, read and write. He is still often confused and doesn't always make sense but that is expected at this time. On October 25, a head CT showed that Danny's shunt was not draining properly and he was sent back to Ben Taub Neurology ICU. It was discovered that he had MRSA in his shunt and it had to be removed. He was also getting sick constantly and refusing to eat so they put in a J tube, in addition to his G tube. He also developed a pulmonary embolism and had to have an IVC mesh implanted in his thigh. At that same time, he had an episode of tachycardia where his heart rate got to 190.He finally got his shunt replaced and moved out of ICU after almost 4 weeks but then he went to have the IVC removed and he had another two tachycardia episodes, his highest heart rate going into the 200's. Dannywas then moved to Cardiology ICU to monitor his heart.After a month back at Ben Taub, Danny went back to TIRR Rehabilitation. After TIRR, Danny continued outpatient PT and Speech therapy and was doing amazing in his recoveryIn April 2019, Danny's shunt quit working and he was admitted back into the hospital The docto replace his shunt because his had failed. He also had collapsed lungs and pneumonia. And then he developed a chiari malformation, where his brain tissue extended into his spinal cavity. He had surgery to fix that next. Then they discovered he had MRSA in his lungs. His shunt still isn't removing the fluid enough so they placed an external drain to manually drain the fluid. Once his ventricles shrink down, they will replace the current shunt with one more suited for low pressure hydrocephalus, which is what he has. They decided to intubate and sedate him so he didn't continue to struggle with breathing and congestion.After 12 weeks and countless more brain surgeries, Danny now has a working shunt and has moved back to TIRR for rehabilitation. He still has his vent but is able to breathe on his own. He has just started to move his hands and his feet some. Today was the first day in 12 weeks that he was able to be sat up in a wheelchair instead of laying in a bed. He still isn't doing much on his own but we are confident he will work hard and we will have Danny back again!Read more"

The children are as young as 6 months old and have violent assaults, severe burns and rape trauma. I am providing extensive rehabilitation and safety for babies, pregnant children and little kids from extreme sexual violence, prostitution, FGM and child marriage. THIS IS NOT ANOTHER CHILDRENS HOME. I am globally registered and 100% TAX deductible, and have been nominated for Australian of the Year this year. Finalists are announced in November 2017. ALL Children's homes are businesses that profit from children's abuse and keep them neglected. I AM HERE TO BREAK THAT CYCLE and stop children being sold and their abuse never treated so that adults can financially benefit. MY PROJECT is a step down facility providing top post trauma care, and providing an environment that can ensure recovery and children can go on to commencement or continuance of education. After 2 1/2 years working in the field and on the ground in Kenya and working with partner organisations to care for my kids, I have moved to Nairobi to launch my own Acute Care safe house so I can have a 24/7 role and do the best job possible. The centre will bridge the gap between hospital and school, ensuring the best medical care and stablility is given to each child after trauma. Once the children are well they will enter my education program and attend school funded by the Foundation. My activism and child protection expertise saves children as young as newborns from the horror of sex trafficking, violence, rape, child marriage and FGM to name a few. My centre has capacity to hold 40 - 50 children but I can't do this without funds to support them. Once rehabilitated at my centre, they will be educated in boarding school and also live there which is common for children without families who have sponsors to be able to do. This will then allow for a permanent flow of needy children to access my services and my safe house. As a psychology graduate and Medical School candidate, I have a passion for public and paediatric health and also work tirelessly to provide healthcare and sexual education to poverty stricken persons. Please HELP ME with costs to complete centre furnishings, HUGE medical bills, therapy fees and essentials such as food and clothes.

Our little girl, who is only 3 years and 8 months old, was just diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. She has always been a very healthy and active child, very curious and playful, and there were no warning signs. This spring she had a slight drop in hemoglobin, which rose back up to normal during the summer. On October 20th she got otitis, and upon completion of treatment we did some blood work (October 31). The results suspected leukemia, and the diagnoses was confirmed in Kiev on November 2nd. We started chemo in Ternopil, but we are considering treatment abroad, as medicine in Ukraine leaves us hoping for more. It's free, but there are no supplies. The blood separator (which is essential) does not work. Clinics are in shortage of supporting medication that helps protect the organs from harsh effects of chemo, syringes, catheters, gloves, etc, which we buy in huge amounts. No single use containers for transporting thrombocytes, and it's nearly impossible to find and purchase them, and on top of that they are very expensive. In addition there is medication for the liver, as after chemo it is enlarged. And of course there is shortage of that as well. Please, please help us raise the funds for our daughter's treatment and her next rehab from damages caused by chemo. You will find all my information below. We are very thankful to everyone who helps any way they can (by praying, sharing this post or donating). You are giving us a miracle by increasing a chance for our daughter to have yet another birthday and hopefully a long future, and we sincerely wish you many miracles as well, and most importantly, strong health to your family.If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me in Russian and Ukrainian, and for questions In English please contact our friend, Tatiana Davidoff.

Not long after the profile photo for this campaign was taken, we started to notice changes in him physically. Most people reading this know the story that has followed. 10 years of tests, poking, prodding, a misdiagnosis for 1 full year and then finally treatment.By the time Flynn was around 12 years of age he had decided in his own mind that he would never be able to complete a triathlon, but that's all about to change.After two very successful operations since 2017, along with months of recovery, learning to stand and walk again, endless hours of rehab and confidence building, Flynn is about to prove himself wrong this weekend!It's not a race and it's not a competition either, he's doing this purely to help raise some money which will help pay for equipment to help children and young adults with disabilities. Those who are maybe working to achieve their personal goals too. Flynn lives with LGMD Type 2a (Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy) which means that he has muscle weakness in his limbs, mainly from the hips down. Flynn's version has been rare in that he has had tightening in his achilles & calf muscles too. So while he isn't able to complete very long distances, he is now able to achieve all three disciplines..The target he has set himself is..2km Ocean Swim with his trainer Paulo 15km on a static bike2km walk to the finish line as part of an overall team (Lanzarote Juntos).As tempted as he was to say that he couldn't do this, Flynn is secretly pleased that he is in a position to say yes to the challenge. Much of his ability to walk with confidence these days is thanks to the hard work Paulo & Kris at SwimLab International put in after each operation. We were largely left to it by the health system once the operations were complete, and Flynn was completely bed-bound for weeks. The generosity and time that these guys dedicated to us was priceless. Flynn's gesture to raise funds is also a thank you to Paulo & Kris for everything they've done to help him.The target amount is 10,000€ for a hoist which will be fitted to a local swimming pool. Paulo & Kris will be able to use the hoist in order to train children with physical difficulties in the pool, no matter what their disability is.Any small donations for sponsorships towards the event would be greatly appreciated. Times are hard so no donation is too small. Thanks to everyone who has been so kind over the years. We will keep you posted on the day!read more about Lanzarote JuntosRead more"

He spent almost 10 weeks back in Mayo Clinic. While there, he was in ICU on a feeding tube, kidney dialysis and a Bipap machine to help him breathe! He came home on June 9 but due to his weak body had to go back to the hospital for another week. He is now in a rehab hospital to hopefully get his strength back. Although we have good insurance, our copay for this treatment is $250 a day! When he is released he will have 4 days a week if outpatient rehab at $30 a session!

On August 19, 2018, my family's life changed. My 16-year-old daughter, Lauren, was in a terrible car accident. Lauren and her boyfriend were ejected from the vehicle during the accident. Lauren almost didn't make it out of the crash scene alive. The brave firefighter had to perform an emergency tracheotomy, on scene, for her to breathe. She suffered many facial fractures (practically every bone in her face), a severed ear canal, fractured 2 vertebrates which also pinched the spinal cord, fractured ulna, and lost her right eye. We are praying that the repair on her left eye will allow her to have some vision. She still has not had any movement below the waist and has no fine motor skills. Her boyfriend had to have his left leg amputated and suffered damage to his right leg. As of now, she has had 14 surgeries with many more to come. She has had multiple blood transfusions and has been battling infection after infection. Her dad and I are divorced and neither one has been able to work as we have been by her side everyday. We will need to pay for living facilities, many therapies, wheelchair, wheelchair accessible car, rehab, ramps, meds, etc. This GoFundMe page is being set up because we don't know how long this process will take. There will be many expenses that I don't know how they will get paid. I'm not usually the asking type, but we need everybody's help. We are also asking for prayers for her and our family.

She has been through 2 hospitals and 1 Rehab center for 90+ days but soon to be discharged. By the Grace of God and all the prayers she survived this infection but is left with many physical issues. Her battle with Covid 19 consisted of several medications, IVs and tests all while fighting Bilateral Pneumonia and the Covid Virus, she was in ICU, she was put in a medically induced coma for 20 days, she had to be put on a ventilator to breath causing her body to fill up with air putting pressure on her heart which causes cardiac issues. With the lengthy ventilator use on day 36 to avoid possible damage to her vocal chords and throat she had to get a tracheotomy. She was on ventilator for a total of 60 days and she battled with low blood pressure issues constantly. It definitely took a toll on her physically, mentally and emotionally and she had to go through it all alone with no family physically by her side. She is in rehab rebuilding muscles, speech, swallowing, eating, standing, walking and working on simple tasks with eye and hand coordination.We are so grateful that she survived this horrible virus, especially after being told she had a 1% chance of surviving and 3 times we were told she would not make it through to the next day. It has been a very emotional journey which has changed her life and the life she was living but we are glad to have the opportunity to have her home to live and love as she was meant to do. We all must accept that she won't be able to do the things she was used to doing. She is a loving mom, grandma and great grandma and through the many years has always been actively involved with family. Before she was infected she was working at the same job for the last 52 yrs as the Nutritional Manager for thousands of kids that passed through the doors of the Fremont County Head Start. She may not be able to do these things like before but if it's up to her she will sure try. She is a Cancer survivor and now she is a Covid 19 Survivor, she is a miracle and proof that prayer works and we are in God's hands.She will soon return home and cared for by family, her home is being transformed with ramps, handicap bathroom and such. The medical bills are slowly starting to roll in and with such high amounts the co pay that is required will wipe out any funds to do other necessary transformations.Her medical care will be needing financial support, we know times are hard for several but any little bit helps and please share this post with your friends and family.

They shared this information initially about their

“Our 21-year old son, Matthew, had a severe motorcycle accident Saturday evening California time.


He lost control and hit a guard rail on the highway. His left shoulder and arm were severely damaged, he lost a lot of blood, and his neck is broken. He is alive. He came through surgery but is still asleep.


The surgeons do not know if he will be able to use his arm again (he is left-handed) and whether amputation will be necessary. The next 24 hours are critical as he comes out of anesthesia, and they are able to determine the extent of the nerve damage to the arm and whether the artery bypass will be successful so that he can keep his arm. They also do not know the extent of the neck injury and brain trauma. The initial brain scan was positive, but he is not awake yet.

Our second son, Jonathan, with whom Matthew lives, was at the ER for many hours. He is headed home now to sleep, and the hospital will let him and us know when Matthew is awake.

Please pray for comfort for each of our kids are they are spread out in Croatia, Germany, Kansas City, and California. Please pray for Matthew's full recovery and rehab, and for much wisdom for the surgeons who have to make hard decisions about keeping his arm. We are very thankful that Matthew is 
alive “

Her head was tilted up, her tongue was sticking out of her mouth, and her eyes were rolled in the back of her head. I immediately dialed 911 and proceeded to do CPR. I waited about 5 to 7 minutes until the paramedics arrived to take over. They shocked her to get a pulse and heartbeat and rushed her to the emergency room at Children’s National Medical Center in DC. I made it to the hospital around 5:30 am and the code team were still performing CPR. They had to shock her again and I heard they also did it in the ambulance on their way to the ER. It wasn’t until 6 am that they got a stable heartbeat and pulse to move her up to the ICU. She had developed arrythmias or extra irregular heartbeats. Her body was without a good oxygen flow for roughly 75 to 80 minutes. Because of that, her brain was severely damaged. She was in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit overnight until she was cleared for COVID. She was then transferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit the next morning. She was on a ventilator to help her breathe and on other machines to help her other organs function. They had to focus mostly on the heart and the brain. She had tons of EKGs and EEgs to keep a close view on both organs and plan her care accordingly. A MRI was done on the brain during its peak swelling stages. From those results, the neurologists strongly believed that Avery would not be able to see, move, eat or interact with others on her own ever again. Due to the irregular heartbeats, the cardiologists believed that there was a strong chance that Avery would have another cardiac arrest but wouldn’t be able to be revived from it. So they recommended a defibrillator to be placed inside of her chest to send a shock to the heart whenever an irregular heartbeat occurred or if the heart ever stopped. Avery is no longer on any machines. She is breathing on her own and her organs are functioning on their own. She now has a G-tube for nutrition since she is not eating on her own. She underwent a heart procedure, an ablation, where all the tissues causing the irregular heartbeats were destroyed. Since then, we have not seen any. However, there has been an increase of “neurostorming” episodes or medically termed as Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity. Symptoms include overly exaggerated cries, increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, sweating, and muscle posturing. It is off and on for hours. She has been given tons of meds to try to loosen her tone.On October 15, 2020, we finally reached REHAB!! We are currently an hour away at the Kennedy Krieger Institute. We are set to be there for 8 weeks so far. The discharge date will depend on Avery’s progress. In rehab, Avery is dealing with physical therapists, occupational therapists, recreational therapists, neuropsychologists, behavior psychologists, and of course nurses and pediatricians. The road to recovery has been stressful; just dealing with the emotional part of the process. It still has other factors that we have to put into play. I am currently on unpaid Family Medical Leave. We have the insurance that is covering most of the expenses but we are still looking at a very expensive recovery. This fund is created to cover Avery’s medical expenses during and after her hospital/institution stay. We are currently in the process of finding a new home that is spacious, wheelchair accessible and ADA compliant. We have to get medical equipment that she will need such as hospital bed, wheelchair, car seat, meds, diapers, etc. We also will need to have a nurse in the home for 8 hours, either during the day so I can work or during the night so I can sleep. There will be no 24 hours nurse help. This fund will also support Avery’s younger sister, Zola. Zola witnessed the entire trauma that dreadful morning and has been coping on her own terms. It will provide counseling for the both of us as we prepare ourselves for Avery’s arrival back home and her future. Everything is still in process and nothing is set in stone. We thank everyone for their continued prayers and blessings. Your prayers have got us here.We want complete healing of Avery’s body. She deserves this miracle.

I talked with the ALS Association and was told it doesn’t matter what type of insurance you have, soon Mike will have Medicare, home care is paid for all out of pocket. The only time they will pay for home care will be for therapy or if he needed skilled nursing for something like wound care. I will not be able to return to work because I am his primary caregiver with help from my 22 year old son Matt, who left school temporarily to help. Needing Matt was only temporary and I will need to hire someone to help me, I am not strong enough to care for him myself, and being awake 24 hours with no break is an option I can’t continue to do. This disease is horrible, it robs you of your ability to care for yourself or be independent. So not only does this disease take away your loved one in a horrific way, it leaves you in financial devastation during and after. I don’t know how people do it, unless they have a large family where family members can take shifts, something we do not have. Please continue to share. The cost of Mike’s medical equipment has not been covered by insurance and the larger items have not been available in the ALS loan closet. Please share our GoFundMe page! Thank you everyone for your support!#MikeStrong #ScherStrong#ALSSucks #FightingALSUpdate ❤️❤️2-26-19We are still trying to comprehend the diagnosis of ALS and what it means for today, tomorrow, and the future. With the disease, comes a lot of spasticity and fasciculations, which are incredibly painful and never seem to stop. Trying to find the right medications is tough, but we are on the right track. Mike continues to fight and be strong through all of this. Therapy is still twice a week and Mike pushes himself through all the aches, pains, and walls that stand before him. One day at a time. With the advancement of the disease, he has outgrown many of his medical home supplies, and now needs more heavy duty, hospital quality equipment. Yesterday his hospital bed was delivered. Trying to make our front room a homey bedroom and comfortable. Room is large enough for his power wheelchair to sit right next to his bed, and when necessary the lift will fit also. We are so overwhelmed by the support of friends, family, and the community our boys grew up in. We love our Lutz family! Please continue to share our page. Mike’s fight has just begun. #MikeStrong#ScherStrong#FightALS#F*ckALSUpdate❤️❤️2-18-19Many of you have read Michael's story below. Today Mike finally had his EMG. With many prayers and hopes, we did not get the outcome we had wished for. Michael has been diagnosed with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) also known as Lou Gehrig's disease of which there are no known cures. Trying to stay strong, Mike is a fighter. Right now he will be continuing with his physical/occupational therapy at Tampa General Hospital Outpatient Rehabilitation. He will be followed by the ALS Clinic at USF. Mike has a long battle ahead of him and with this diagnosis, the medical bills have started mounting, more home equipment and home healthcare are needed. We are still saving for the Conversion Van as this is now a necessity to get Mike to and from therapy, doctor appointments, and to get out and enjoy time with friends and family.We thank everyone for their prayers and donations. Please continue to share. Mike's fight has just begun.#MikeStrong#FightALS❤️Michael's story.As many of you may know, my father Michael Scher has been battling some serious medical issues. In August 2017, Mike had a laminectomy with fusion to decompress the nerves in his spine. Although he had improvement initially, in April 2018, he began to experience a rapid deterioration and atrophy of the muscles throughout his body. What started as walking with a cane, went to a walker, and now uses a power wheelchair. On December 14, 2018, Mike was admitted to Tampa General Hospital. On December 20th, he was moved into the In-Patient Rehab for Spinal Cord Injuries. Numerous tests have been done and there are still more being performed. Upon his release, January 17th, he will be followed up by USF Neurology Group as they are still searching for a diagnosis. We have been told that my dad has a neuromuscular disease but do not have a definitive diagnosis of which of these it is. An EMG will be performed in February to find a definitive answer and hopefully begin a treatment to hold off the disease. He will continue his physical and occupational therapy 3 times a week at Tampa General Hospital Outpatient Rehab. When Mike and my mother Shari sat down with the case worker regarding their plans on bringing Michael home, they came to the conclusion that Michael needs 24 hour care and could not be left alone. My mom, Shari being his primary care giver, could no longer lift, move, or care for him on her own. The choices were find 24 hour care for Mike or have him go into a nursing home. Shari couldn’t bring herself to put him in a home; my brother Matthew, age 21, was asked to take a break from college and care for our father. A selfless sacrifice that no child should have to make, but provided what could be described as the ultimate gift, providing help to care for his father. Unfortunately, throughout this process, Michael was in between jobs due to his company being acquired and him looking for his next opportunity. Therefore, he did not have insurance. He is currently on Medicaid which fights paying for care. Mike, has always been a giver. He has always been the devoted husband, father, and always made sure he was there for others when help was needed. He always loved being at the baseball field watching my brother and I play ball, and being around friends and the community. Now Mike and our family are in need. He will be in an electric wheelchair that cannot be carried on the back of a car on a lift. We were told that we need a Conversion Van to transport Mike and his wheelchair. An expense too great right now along with the other medical expenses and equipment he will be needing for his care. We are asking for donations to cover the cost of buying a used conversion van, accessibility features needed to the house to assist with his challenges, and the medical expenses facing Michael and our family.Read more"

Read our story and support her recovery. With your support, we can provide the best care possible and generate the HOPE that she regain her independence again!OUR STORYThursday, May 7th, started out as normal as any other pandemic day. Mother’s Day was a few days away, cards were being bought, plans were being made, all from our homes as we continued to socially distance. In a small town in North Carolina, our mom, Adrienne, – sister, aunt and Nana – was working from home. At 65 years old and a few months from her planned retirement, mom had never worked from home, and all her younger coworkers were giving her heck about it. All in good fun, which she loved by the way! Full of life, active, and quick-witted, she was always dishing out as much as she received, if not more. In fact, she was gathering hair curlers, a gaudy robe and a face mask to wear to her company’s next Zoom meeting to show them how she worked from home!THE FALLThursday evening continued with normalcy. The news was reporting the President’s valet tested positive for COVID and that meat processing plants were reopening on Friday. Living by herself, mom often spent time with her long-time friend and neighbor. That night the two ate dinner, and then mom went home early to get ready for the next exciting day of commuting from the bed to her desk in the living room. After watching a bit of TV, she got up to get a glass of water and on her way to the kitchen, she collapsed. She was completely paralyzed.She was on the floor, unable to move, and her phone laid on the floor 6 inches from her still (inert) fingers. Thursday night crawled into Friday morning with mom fully conscious, calling out, and praying for someone to come to her aid. Though mom was supposed to be working, the “stay-at-home” orders requiring her to work from home made her absences less noticeable. Her brother Richard started texting her Friday to finalize plans about a Mother’s Day dinner that weekend. Since she was scheduled to work, delayed responses from mom would have been normal.What happened after her fall is an unthinkable scenario that we can barely start to contemplate at this point, and is difficult to put into words. Our strong, independent mother laid on her floor seeing and listening to calls and texts come through her phone inches from her hand without the ability to answer. Making it more difficult, is the knowledge that we were prohibited from visiting her for Mother’s Day weekend due to COVID restrictions from her job that didn’t allow her to interact with anyone who lived more than 50 miles away from her. What would have been if we could have continued our plans to spend the weekend together?….Friday became Saturday. Our Uncle, worried he had still not heard from her, called the neighbor she had dinner with Thursday night. Immediately going to check, the neighbor found mom where she had collapsed 36 hours earlier. Still alive, but not moving.HOSPITALIZATIONOf course, brothers and sisters, children and grandchildren were notified and made their way to North Carolina to be with mom; However, COVID is preventing us from being with our mom. Facetime, WebEx, text and phone calls are the only ways we can be “there” for her right now and since she is unable to move her arms, we must call the nurses each and every time we want to speak with her. Apologetic and thankful, we are at the mercy of their schedule for when they can answer our calls and hold the phone for Facetime. It’s also hard to accept call backs as the only communication method for talking with the surgeon, case worker, dietitian or nurse to discuss mom’s progress and treatment. Imagine talking to a nurse for a daily update and finding out today wasn’t a good day, that your mother is depressed, feeling alone and confused and you can’t go in the room to give her a hug or just sit and be with her. Thanks COVID.There is no definitive answer on what caused mom to collapse. We have learned she has a fracture of the left C4 transverse process, severe arthritis in her spine with degenerative changes pronounced between C4/5 and C5/6 and spinal stenosis at this level. Her surgeon speculates that this degeneration made her spinal cord vulnerable to pressure that can cause confusion through the nervous system and muscle weakness or malfunction. That Thursday night, she moved in just the wrong way to cause the syncopal episode that led to her spinal cord injury. WHERE WE ARE NOWIt has been 12 days, and mom can wiggle her toes, lift her hands and generate minimal shoulder movement. There is no feeling when touched.We have applied and been accepted to Shepherd Center in Atlanta for in-patient rehabilitation. That is where we are as we reach out to you today, asking for support from our community and beyond.First year costs of a spinal cord injury in mom’s case is between $700,000 and $1,000,000.Here is a glance of what that entails:Mom’s previous conditions of arthritis, degeneration, and herniation in the cervical spine mixed with traumatic injury to the spine causing edema, affect her from her C3 to her C7, which has caused confusion in communication to muscle function and sensation from the chest down.We have been told to expect the following needs:Medical transport from North Carolina to Shepherd Center in AtlantaInpatient rehabOutpatient rehabIn-home nursing visitsMinor and Major Home Modifications during outpatient rehabMajor home modification for long term living/Purchase of modified homeA vehicle modified with adaptive equipmentSpecialized equipment (unknown which specific equipment will be needed at this time)OTHER COSTSWe also have moving costs, storage facility costs, and unknown costs due to not working. We are grateful for the opportunity to be our mom’s full time caretakers for the foreseeable future. There is no way to know at this time how this will affect how we provide for our families and our mom’s grandchildren.THANK YOUIn this time of uncertainty for all of our fellow humans, we appreciate your support and encouragement. This shocking turn of events is already devastating to us, without the added stress of not being able to hold our mother’s hand, brush her hair, make sure she feels comfortable, adjust her pillows for her, moisturize her skin, and keep her company.Your prayers, donations, support, love, and sharing of our story are greatly appreciated. From our family to yours, may we be guided by that which reminds us how intrinsically connected to each other we are, no matter the circumstances. We are in this together. For our mom. For all moms.Thank you,Anthony and MaryMom with her children and grandchildren.Read more"

They had been through unimaginable trauma after witnessing violence, losing family members and losing their home. They were looking for a better and safer life when they were sponsored to come to Canada. Since their arrival they have worked hard to making Edmonton their home. The boys love their school, and the parents are determined to become contributing members of Canadian society. The whole family have been learning English and establishing independence through ownership of a family business selling fresh produce. Ahmad and Halima continue to be extremely grateful to be part of the Edmonton community and Canada as a country, which has given them the opportunity to start a new life with bright futures.On Friday August 21st, 2020, Ahmad El Akdy’s plans for independence were drastically changed. While driving home from Medicine Hat after picking up a load of fresh fruits and vegetables to deliver back to his business, “Veggie Palace”, in Edmonton, Ahmad was involved in a serious car accident. He was airlifted to Calgary Foothills Hospital where he underwent extensive surgery. Sadly, he had sustained a C7 Complete Spinal Cord Injury. Ahmad was later transferred by air ambulance to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton, where he spent the next two months in the ICU. During that difficult time he required a breathing tube, was unable to speak, and due to Covid19 restrictions, was unable to have visitors. Recently, Ahmed has been transferred to the Glenrose Hospital where he continues to receive treatment and rehabilitation related to his spinal cord injury. He has been informed that he will likely never walk again and will require lifelong assistance with mobility such as a wheelchair.Ahmad is known by all as a strong, independent worker, and a loving father and husband. It was his independent spirit that motivated him to start a business, and to provide for his family, who are all excited and eager to become citizens of Canada. The Veggie Palace was officially launched in the Glengarry community of Edmonton in June, 2020 selling quality fresh fruits and vegetables at a fair price. CBC article on Veggie Palace Grand OpeningBusiness was booming, with many customers, and the whole family were so proud of getting it off the ground when tragedy happened. This accident has been a heartbreaking setback for the whole family. Halima is working extremely hard at keeping the shop running, overseeing the children’s educational and household needs, supporting Ahmad with daily hospital visits, and working nights doing cleaning/maintenance in a nearby shopping mall along with their eldest (now)16-year-old son. The family faces a long road ahead in supporting Ahmad, both physically and emotionally, in his rehabilitation as they attempt to move forward as self-supporting citizens. Our goal is to assist Ahmad and his family through his recovery and rehabilitation first by preparing for a good transition from hospital to home, then to assist with unmet needs to support his future success.There have been and will continue to be many unanticipated setbacks for the family including costs to their business, loss of the business truck, the need to renovation to their home to make it wheelchair accessible or maybe to relocate; modifications to their vehicle for accessibility and many medical supplies and aids to daily living. Modifications are also needed to the family business, the “Veggie Palace”, if Ahmad and family are to continue to support themselves. It would be wonderful to have an accessible building, with ramps and wide doors, welcoming to all with mobility issues. The motivation for this GoFundMe initiative is to support Ahmad’s recovery and his eventual return to independence by assisting with expenses, adjustments, and rehabilitation in the months ahead. Any amount of monetary donation would be greatly appreciated. The funds raised will directly support Ahmad's transition as he adapts and adjusts to this new reality. All of the funds raised will contribute to achieving full independence and participation in the community and in Edmonton, home of this family of six.The team members organizing this fundraiser include people who know and love the family including the original sponsors for the El-Akdy -Bakfouli family, teachers from the children’s school, and community members.Read more"

Recovery was to only be a few days in the hospital, but she now faces additional surgery, months or years of life-changing rehabilitation, and the uncertainty of whether she will regain the use of her arms and legs and to what extent.The Reynolds family is facing this devastating tragedy with hope and faith but limited financial resources and we, her family and friends, are humbly asking for your help.About the Reynolds:Jessica and Brent have been married for 14 years and are the proud and loving parents to Skyla (13), Scout (11), Ryker (9), Gia (7), Roman (4), and Rayni (2). Their love of children has led them to foster many children over the years, from babies through teenagers. They have established and led a crisis marriage support group and are dedicated homeschool parents. They work hard to raise their children in a strong biblical environment, represented by the words of encouragement Skyla gave her mom shortly after she woke up to discover the paralysis. She said to Jessica, “Remember Mom, God does not promise that we will be happy but He promises us joy.”The Reynolds are a wonderful family that find themselves facing an unimaginable situation.Immediate Needs:$2000 - Transportation to DallasJessica requires another immediate surgery to correct the previous attempt. This surgery will remove the replacement disc, which has shifted, and fuse the discs together. She will travel to Dallas for this surgery and this ambulance transportation is not covered by their insurance.$5000+ - Temporary Living ExpensesFailing a miracle that corrects Jessica’s paralysis, she is facing months of rehabilitation in Denver. As both Jessica and Brent will be unable to work during this time they will have some basic living expenses to cover.Future Needs:Much will be determined over the next couple of weeks as the second surgery is completed and an accurate assessment of her condition is determined. Some potential needs may be:- Extended relocation to Denver- Equipment to make her home more functional- Home retrofits to allow for wheelchair accessJessica and Brent are strong, loving, faithful, honest, and selfless people. They have fought for the well being of their foster children and would give you the clothes off their back if you needed them, and right now they need our help.Please consider giving support to the Reynolds to help them in this overwhelmingly difficult time. No gift is too small, anything is appreciated.Thank you,Family & Friends of the Reynolds-------------------------------------------------------------------A Message from Brent:On November 19 2020 Jessica had surgery to replace 2 disks in her spine. For many years she had lived with crippling migraines and back pain. We tried all the different migraine medicines none really worked very well. We finally had an MRI and CAT scans done to see if we could find out if there was an issue that could be addressed. We found out she had 2 disks in her spine completely degraded down to nothing.Ah ha we thought, get these fused or replaced with artificial disks a night in the hospital and after a week or so of rest she would be right as rain and better than ever. We consulted with 4 surgeons to figure out the best course of action and scheduled the surgery.Jess was nervous but excited to get back the feeling of normal again that had evaded her for so many years. We went on one last trip the weekend before surgery to hike and fish and had a great time. We felt at ease and ready for the surgery. The day of the surgery we got to the hospital and surgery started a few hours later than it was scheduled so I read calming and reassuring scriptures to her as we waited.I watched the digital board while she was in surgery waiting for phase one recovery to pop up. Once it hit phase 2, I could see her. After the surgery was over and she was in phase1 the doctor told me it would be about 45 min or so then he would move her to phase 2 and I could come in. 3 hours passed and 7pm was coming quick (the time they said all visitors had to leave). I asked the nurse as to what was going on as I was waiting in the waiting room. Finally a few minutes before 7 the doctors assistant came out and said she's still in phase 1 but I could come back anyways and see her.She was relieved to see me but said ""babe I can't move.” I told her I'm sure it’s just the anesthesia still wearing off but the nurses seamed concerned. About an hour later I finally heard that the doctors ordered a CT scan to make sure everything looked good since she still couldn't move. They finally got her into a room an hour or so later and told me I had to leave but she would be ok.Over the night they did another CT scan and upon one of the scans found no bleeding or clots but one disk not in its right place and, from what I gathered, alot of swelling around the spinal cord.And that brings us to today November 27th. Jessica still is paralyzed, needs another surgery and what looks like months of rehab. We are not certain what the future may hold but what we do know is we serve a mighty God the creator of all things. He has been right by our side through our marriage struggles in the past, changing both of us for His plan. He has been drawing us closer to Him, preparing to do whatever work he sets in front of us to glorify His kingdom. Regardless of how this circumstance turns out, I know he has something he wants to use us for and I'm excited to see what it is and I know Jessica is too. This will be a long road and I’mm having to take an extended leave from work to take on a new role of Mr.Mom to our 6 blessings (a greater appreciation of all she does has developed in me) which is a blessing for me but comes with the cost of no income during this time. There will be transportation in the days ahead to get her where she will have her next surgery and to a rehabilitation facility that specializes in spinal cord injuries. We are unsure of what insurance will cover at this point and what more expenses we will see.A Message from Jessica’s Aunt:Jessica Trotter Reynolds is a beautiful Christian woman. At 37, she and her husband, Brent, live in Edmond, Oklahoma, where she home-schools their 6 young children and works at the family business. Jessica has always enjoyed crafting and cooking. She is active in her church and leads a Bible study group. Just before the Thanksgiving Holiday, her idyllic life took a catastrophic turn, comparable to the Book of Job. Jessica is paralyzed.Without the mobility of her hands and legs, Jessica can no longer do the tasks that most people take for granted. She cannot cook, nor make crafts, nor hug her little ones. But, just like Job, she remains steadfast in her faith and love for God. She believes He will heal her one fine day.Jessica has a long, costly journey ahead; an additional operation is required, after which, countless physical and occupational therapy begins. Jessica will be transported via ambulance to Dallas for the crucial surgery and rehabilitation. Unfortunately, she must leave her sweet children back home with their father. Brent has requested an emergency medical leave from work to care full-time for his family.The separation from her children and husband will be unbearable for Jessica, but with God as her strength, she is determined to work hard and reunite with her family. Her goals are to walk again, hold her children in her loving arms, and give God all the glory. Your kind gift in support of this courageous undertaking will be greatly appreciated by Jessica and her family.Read more"

He has broken the left forearm and shattered his hand – this was operated on the day of the accident and he was in theatre for 7 hours, they plated his forearm and now has a cage around the hand where they have pinned and wired it. The Royal Belfast Hospital then sent him to ICU following the operation, where he was put under heavy sedation until the Tuesday to help him with his lungs and trauma to the body.On the Wednesday they transferred him to the fracture ward where he took a turn for the worse in the middle of the night and they had to call for the special care team to come and work and look after him as he was too weak to move back to ICU. The Thursday and Friday were extremely touch-and-go and the doctors were very worried about his and his deterioration, this put back his operation that was pencilled in for his leg on the Friday until he was strong enough to deal with the surgery.The operation went ahead on his leg on Wednesday 27th May, he went to surgery at 10.15 and came back onto the ward that evening at 8pm. He had a pin put in his femur and they have put an external cage around the bottom part of his leg to fix the broken tibia and fibula. He can’t weight bare on the leg for at least 6 – 8 weeks and until we know his progress they haven’t give us a time on how long the cage will be on. Stephen currently has no feeling from the shoulder down on his left arm so he is being transported via ambulance on Wednesday 3rd June for the day to see a top nerve specialist, he will go down to Dublin and back in the day. It looks like Stephen could be in hospital for a long stay until he has more movement in his arm and leg. The broken ribs are making progress which is also helping get his breathing more stable.”As a friend of Charlotte, partner to Stephen I have set up this page to help him with his rehab and recovery which is set to be a very long road. Stephen is self-employed and currently remains in the Royal Belfast hospital, he was originally in Intensive Care/HDU for several days and the doctors anxiously waited for progress before they could perform another operation.Stephen and Charlotte have two girls Fay and Libbie, they are asking for nothing from anyone except prayers and well wishes. I suggested to Charlotte to set up this GoFund page and if anyone wishes to help with a donation to help Stephen with his recovery it would be very much appreciated.http://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/belfast-news/rider-stephen-thompson-spectator-critical-9271000http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-32771583 ALL the donations made on this page will go to Charlotte and Stephen to help with his recovery of his terrible injuries.Here are some updates from Charlotte Charlotte Pullan Was Bridge21 May at 20:22·Edited·Stephen through the night had a drop in his progress.

He was with the physio's quite a lot today working on his hand and leg. He got out of the bed for about ten minutes where he was sized for his wheelchair, that was a big thing and he got very light headed and had to be put back into bed. We sat and chatted lots today and although he has been told what his injuries are I had to explain then to him telling him he had bleeding on the brain, brachial plexus injury, broken rib, shattered hand, collapsed lungs, broken femur, broken tib and fib and damaged his knee, he said to me I have been knocked about a bit then!

Stephen didn't know what to expect really I was thinking it could be bad news medium news or good news. We got ok news which is better than bad news so there was a positive. They can operate and transfer nerves out of Stephens chest area to connect them from the neck to the arm this will give Stephen some movement in the top part of his arm. Stephen has had a lot to take on today an although found it hard to take in is determined that he is going to put all his effort into getting his arm mobile. We can't thank the nurses at the royal enough for all the work and care they are giving Stephen even one of the nurses was in Dublin on her day off and called in and spent the whole time we were there with us. Also tonight we met a lovely couple who has gone through a similar thing 15 years ago they called into see Stephen they have been following our updates on FB and contacted me to see if they could come and see him, speaking to Robbie really helped Stephen tonight. Again thank you for all your well wishes and prayers keep them coming. Charlotte Fay, Libbie, Sefty, Paul, Bev and the wider family circle.Published by Charlotte Pullan Was Bridge · 23 July at 00:12 ·Ok I haven't updated since last Wednesday as you know when Stephen had his accident he suffered a lot of injuries his arm being one of the worst, he had the brachial plexus injury and a bad break in the forearm but lots of trauma to the arm. He has had lots of problems with the arm since that day. As my last post was we went to the ulster hospital last Wednesday for a consultation what we thought for a skin graft and they weren't happy with it so they admitted him with a view to operate on him immediately he had an operation on his arm on the Thursday as they needed all the surgeons involved the prognosis wasn't good and the surgeon didn't give us good news that night. They scheduled him in on Saturday for another operation on the arm but unfortunately that didn't go well either Stephens arm suffered so much trauma in the accident and the forearm was suffering from muscle wastage and other problem with blood supply. The surgeons explained to us that it was infected and if they didn't act soon it could be a worse situation than we were in. Stephen had to make a life changing decision either to lose the lower part of his arm or we could lose him. Stephen made this decision on Sunday after speaking to the surgeons and today the operation was scheduled in. Stephen has come through today's surgery well and today is the start of the road to recovery. Thank you for all your continued support and prayers it means a lot to us all especially to Stephen.Published by Charlotte Pullan Was Bridge · 24 July at 22:24 · Edited ·Stephen was suffering today with lots of what they call phantom nerve pain. The pain team came around and are trying different medication to try and sort this out. He will hopefully be back in Musgrave early next week to start back with his rehabilitation which means he is one step closer to home. It's hard to think the accident is 10 weeks tomorrow he has been through so much mentally and physically in that time, he is definitely a fighter and we will get through this. Over the last two days the messages, phone calls have been mind blowing we cant thank you all enough for your support it is really helping us and keeping our spirits up. Thank you to all the staff at the Ulster hospital for their kind care and support. Please keep stephen in your prayers xPublished by Charlotte Pullan Was Bridge · 23 hrs ·Stephen today has had a good day talking very positive about his goals and I have to say looks very good his mobility of getting in and out of the bed and manoeuvring himself about himself is really good. He is still suffering with what they call phantom pain. He is hoping to get back to musgrave mon/tues to get back to his rehab. We can't thank the staff at the ulster enough for their support and care though. Today he had a special little visitor and Cousin Bradley came into see him smile emoticon. Please keep Stephen in your prayers for his continued recovery.Read more"

She worked at a nursing home and assisted living. She was supposed to start Nursing School in August but her dream has been derailed.She also recently got her real estate license to try to provide for her children as a single mom.She went through her motherly duties of making sure that her kids were fed and cared for. She gave them each a kiss, and then made her way out the door to join friends at a small outdoor social gathering. Never would she have imagined that the peace she sought from her grueling routine, would have been shattered by senseless violence. On July 5 around 3:00 am in Conyers,GA during the small outdoor gathering she was shot in the back by a stray bullet .The stray bullet shattered her spine.She is unable to feel or move her legs and feet. Her fear now is not for herself, but for her children who needs her to continue being their Superwoman. She is determined to remain just that, but now she faces debt that threatens her ability to provide for her children. Also she is trying to get rehab at the Shepherd Center, where they specialize in spinal injuries, but her insurance doesn't cover rehab.We need to raise money to help with therapy and rearrangement of living accommodations. She is going to need a home without stairs and be able to make adjustments to the home.There are many words that can be used to describe Sidoneé Josephs– strong, loyal, trustworthy, dependable and reliable. Those are adjectives that her friends would use, but for her children she is simply – Superwoman. Sidoneé has sacrificed the remainder of her life for her kids, never trusting in anyone else’s ability to raise them – other than her own. She placed her own goals and aspirations on hold, in order to provide for their immediate needs. Her efforts are seen in her kids that are extremely polite, loving, smart, and yet humble. Her 15 year old daughter started her first year of college this past May. She wants to become a doctor. Her 11 year old is now in 7th grade. These are kids that need their mom with them, a mom that needs to remain strong and steadfast in ensuring that they continue to receive her love and be guided by her wisdom and strength.

Doing what he loved most, bike riding, he crashed on one of his long rides in Roanoke, VA, where he, his wife Melissa, and their 2 children live. Bob severed his spine at the T-4 area and will never use his legs again. He is now paralyzed from his chest down. It has taken a month for Bob’s condition to stabilize. He has been unable to breathe and doctors performed a tracheotomy to help him. Imagine waking up in a hospital room not knowing how you got there, not knowing why you can’t move, and not being able to breathe. For those of us who love dear Bob, it has been a month spent imagining how we can make his life better while we wipe away our tears.Bob has spent the past 30 days in the ICU in Roanoke but has finally been approved to be transported to Atlanta’s Shepherd Rehabilitation Center, where he will continue to learn to breathe on his own and begin getting acquainted with his new normal. This is VERY good news as Sheperd Center is one of the best rehab facilities in the US. The Shepherd Center staff will soon experience the Mr. Robillard his loyal students know so well. He will have nurses laughing and physical therapists blasting 80’s punk and new wave. He’ll request olive-colored gowns to accent his eyes and decorate his room with free items from Craig’s list. The Sheperd Center newsletter will get a new editor and their rehabilitation protocol will soon include memorizing the bill of rights. Bob simply can’t help himself; enthusiasm is what he does!Wherever Bob goes, his attitude and work ethic make a difference. He not only teaches history and government in high school but also coaches tennis, edits the yearbook, and leads the Model United Nations team. He also taught high school in Shanghai and housed Ocean, an exchange student from China for a year. (For parents… Ocean had daily violin practice i.e. Bob has the patience of a saint) For the past two years, Bob and Melissa have been foster parents to two beautiful children.Bob is an inspiration and a FIGHTER, yet even Bob’s optimism cannot surmount the challenges and costs his family will face in the future. Bob has been in the hospital ICU for a month. He will spend 6-8 months living in a renowned rehabilitation center and Melissa will need to fly from Roanoke and find childcare while she is away. Their current house will never be ADA ready so they will need a bigger, more open, layout. Bob will also need a van to lift him in and out of the car. There will also be countless other technologies needed to increase his quality of life. Sadly, the list seems endless.As some of Bob’s oldest and closest friends we are asking for your help. Please be as generous and caring as we know Bob would for anyone of us. The emotional and financial toll of Bob’s journey is daunting but not insurmountable. We will do everything possible to minimize the effects of his paralysis and bring Bob back to the classroom.Bob’s love for life, love of the unknown, love of music, love of humor, love for the color green (because it matches his kind eyes), and a love for finding a bargain describe him. However, his love for his family, friends, and students define him. It is time for us to return that love. Please support him and his family on their long journey to discovering a new normal. We would be deeply humbled and grateful if you will help us HELP our friend. Your support matters to Bob, Melissa, and their family. Whatever their new normal looks like, it will include a new type of “bike therapy.” but retain Bob’s sense of hope and optimism.

While it hasbeen emotionally and physically draining on both of them. It has also begun to affect them financially. The out of pocket cost for dialysis transport each week is $1,000.00. This is treatment and transportation that Jeanine will require for the rest of her life.Once she is stable enough to be discharged from the hospital, she will again require a stay at rehab to improve her endurance and stamina, until she is deemed safe enough to come home.Unfortunately,at this time, almost all of her allotted days approved by insurance have been used. Bob will be paying out of pocket for her stay at a rate of $170.00/day.We know that Jeanine has been a staple in both her community and school. She has not only shown tremendous love for her own children, Claire, myself and hergrandchildren, but also for all of the people she has invited into her homethroughoutthe years andhas been a secondmother to all.Jeanine has always been there as a shoulder to cry on and with a listening ear, and she would be the first one to support anyone who needed it.

Al contrario cada dia se le baja mas el oxígeno, se le descontrolaba mucho el nivel cardiaco , la presión , los glóbulos rojos muy bajos a falta de oxígeno y la ayuda del ventilador al 100% , recibió dos unidades de plasma y no hubo ninguna mejoría. Septiembre 26 el doctor decidió trasladarlo al área de cuidados intensivos (ICU) para inducirlo en coma usando la mascarilla Bipap y así estuvo 5 días sin ningún mejoramiento. Septiembre 30 a las 11:30 am recibí una llamada era para avisarme que lo tenían que entubar de emergencia porque su pulmones estaban muy DAÑADOS y su corazón muy debil. Ese mismo dia me volvieron a llamar a las 7:50pm para avisarme que mi hermano había dejado de respirar que había perdido sus signos vitales, en ese momento senti que mi corazón paró de latir, mis piernas me temblaron, se vino a mi mente mis papas, y llorando con ese nudo en mi garganta le pregunte “dime que mi hermano está vivo” y me contestaron que sí, que sin la necesidad de máquinas o primeros auxilio mi hermano había regresado a la vida. Asi transcurrieron los dias hasta que cumplio 21 días entubado sin nada de cambio y todos los días que llamaba era la misma respuesta “tu hermano está en estado crítico, sus pulmones siguen muy dañados.” Cada vez que le bajan al medicamento de coma (usaban tres sedantes), él quería despertar tratando de retirar el tubo y cuando este episodio pasaba le volvían a subir a la dosis del sedante para volverlo a dormir, todas las noches le llamaba por videollamada para orar con él, le cantaba alabanzas, le recordaba que lo quería mucho que lo necesitábamos vivo, que nos hacía mucha falta a mis papás, a sus hijas, a su prometida, a mis hijas y sobre todo a mi. Para los que nos conocen saben que somos hermanos únicos, muy unidos y verlo dormido, entubado era un dolor tan grande inexplicable. Octubre 19 a las 11:00am recibo una llamada y me dicen que iban a inducir un medicamento paralizante por 3 dias ya que este medicamento favorece más para que mi hermano esté completamente paralizado. A la 1:35pm mientras oraba en la iglesia recibí nuevamente una llamada para avisarme que el pulmón izquierdo había colapsado y que le introdujeron a una cirugía de emergencia para ponerle un tubo en su pulmón y que pudiera recibir el oxígeno directo. Octubre 20 a las 12:30pm me habla por primera vez el Doctor y me dice que mi hermano no ha tenido avance aun con el entubamiento y que iban a proceder con la traqueotomía (tubo inducido en la garganta) para ayudarlo a recibir el oxígeno directo a los pulmones. Octubre 30 me avisan que van a trasladar a mi hermano a Solara Rehab Hospital al área de cuidados intensivos para que el reciba la terapia adecuada y le ayuden a bajarle a la ayuda del ventilador y así poder quitárselo poco a poco. Noviembre 2 a las 6:00 am recibo una llamada del enfermero para avisarme que se le colapsó el pulmón derecho, que le iban hacer una pequeña cirugía de emergencia para inducir el tubo en su pulmón. Continuo en estado muy crítico: 2 pulmones colapsados, ritmo cardiaco muy elevado, presión muy baja, y usando la máxima ayuda del ventilador. Noviembre 10 5:00 pm me llama el enfermero de guardia para avisarme que mi hermano estaba perdiendo sus signos vitales, que su corazón estaba muy débil que si autorizaba darle a mi hermano primeros auxilios incluyendo los ultra shocks en su corazón y que podía tener consecuencia de romperle las costillas. Cual mi respuesta fue haz lo que tengas que hacer para salvarle la vida a mi hermano. Y ese mismo enfermero me dio una “consejo” que si él fuera su hermano lo dejaría descansar ya que estába sufriendo mucho. Gracias a Dios que es mi hermano y no le hice caso a su consejo porque yo no le di la vida y yo no se la iba a quitar. Esa misma noche a las 8:15pm recibo una llamada del doctor para decirme lo mismo, que mi hermano ya llevaba mucho tiempo en el ventilador y sin avances. Fue tanta mi amor, Fe y esperanza hacia Dios que bloquee mi mente para no escuchar al doctor y yo solo le conteste “Doctor usted salve la vida de mi hermano haga su trabajo, que mi trabajo es pedirle a Dios por usted, para que guíe sus manos, sus conocimientos y pueda salvarle la vida.” El dia siguiente ponen a una enfermera que fue el angel para mi hermano ese angel que nos volvio a dar luz en la obscuridad, mas fuerzas a nuestra fe y esperanza. Ella poco a poco le fue quitando los sedantes, “jugando” con los medicamentos para no descontrolar su corazon, y presion. Noviembre 13 fue el dia mas esperado mas feliz despues casi 2 meses de sufrimiento mi hermano DESPERTO y recupero un poco el conocimiento. Imaginense si yo le hubiera hecho caso a los “consejos” del enfermero de desconectar a mi hermano. Mi hermano no estuviera vivo. Gracias a Dios por haberme dado ese amor de luchar por la vida de mi hermano, de entender y esperar que los tiempos de Dios son perfectos. Noviembre 24 después de 92 días deja mi hermano el ventilador para usar solamente el oxígeno de pared. Empezaron a darle terapias físicas porque debido a tanto tiempo en coma, sedantes paralizantes y muchos dias en cama perdio la movilidad en su cuerpo. Noviembre 27 le retiran el tubo del primer pulmon que se le colapso. Diciembre 2 mi hermano siguio batallando para respirar y le hacen un catscan y efectivamente el pulmon derecho presenta un poco de neumonía asi que el doctor sugiere que mi hermano continue en ICU. Diciembre 9 finalmente le retiran la traqueotomía le hacen analisis de sangre y muestra muy favorable su oxígeno. Diciembre 14 lo trasladan a otro centro de rehabilitación para que reciba las terapias físicas y hasta hoy Diciembre 29 sigue hospitalizado, luchando en esta batalla, recibiendo sus terapias para volver a caminar y tener esa movilidad que perdio en estos casi 4 meses. Por eso les pedimos a todos que nos ayuden a seguir orando por la completa recuperación de mi hermano y sobre todo les pedimos que nos ayuden con nuestra campaña para recaudar fondos y poder ayudar a mi hermano a cubrir esos miles de recibos que estamos recibiendo de los hospitales, doctores, y clinicas. Mi hermano tiene 4 meses sin trabajar, sin recibir ningun tipo de ingreso al contrario los cobros no paran, y sus gastos medicos siguen acumulandose para seguir en sus terapias, el va a necesitar a condicionar su cuarto de casa con cama de hospital, los banos portatiles, etc. todo esto con la finalidad que siga teniendo todo accesibles a su condición médica. Por favor ayúdenos con su donativo para que mi hermano pueda concentrarse en su recuperación absoluta. Dios los bendiga a cada uno de ustedes y familia.- Con carino, Nena Cecere.[ENGLISH]On September 12 my brother Raul Rdz jr. was admitted to the hospital due to lack of oxygen. An average person saturates between 95-100% and at that point my brothers’s oximeter measured 73%. Within the first 14 days his lungs became weaker, retained water, and began showing signs of pneumonia. He started using 3 different nasal face masks, including Bipap & CPap, in which all were connected to a ventilator yet there was no favorable change. In fact, plasma therapy was tried on him twice and even then his oxygen levels would drop by the day. Every day his heartrate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation would get out of control and his dependence on the ventilator grew to where he was using it at 100%. September 26 the doctor decided to move him to the intensive care unit (ICU) in order to put him into an induced coma while using the Bipap mask, and he continued like that for the next 5 days without change. On September 30 at 11:30am I received a call letting me know that he had an emergency intubation due to his DAMAGED lungs along with his weak heart. That same day I received another call at around 7:50pm letting me know that my brother had completely stopped breathing and had lost his vital signs. At that moment I felt that my heart stopped beating, my legs started shaking, and the only thing that came to mind was my parents. Crying, as I struggled to speak again, I asked them “tell me that my brother is alive'' and they said yes, that without the help of any machine or CPR he had come back to life. For 21 days he remained intubated with little to no change and everyday that I would call for an update the response was the same: “your brother is in a critical state, his lungs are severely damaged.” Every time the medication that controlled his comma was lowered (he used 3 different kinds), his body immediately wanted to wake up and attempted to remove the breathing tube and once that would happen his medication would go back up again. Every night I would call him on facetime to pray, sing worship music, and to most importantly remind him how much mom, dad, his daughters, my daughters, his fiancee and I missed him and needed him dearly. For those who know us know that we are inseparable and to see him in a sleeping state while being intubated brought me nothing but a massive and inexplicable pain. On October 19 at around 11:00am I received a call to inform me that he was being induced with a new medication that would paralyze him for 3 days, and although the idea was frightening it was in his best interest. At 1:35pm while I was at church praying, I received yet another call to let me know that his left lung had collapsed and was introduced to an emergency surgery that involved puncturing a tube through his lung in order for him to receive direct oxygen. For the first time ever, on October 20 at 12:30pm, the doctor called to tell me that my brother had not advanced in any shape or form even with the intubation, and with that being said they were going to proceed with a tracheostomy (a tube through his windpipe) in hopes that it would help him receive direct oxygen to his lungs. On october 30, I was told that he was being moved to Solara Rehab Hospital in the ICU area so that he could receive adequate therapy with the ultimate goal of diminishing his dependence on the ventilator little by little. November 2 at 6:00am, his nurse called letting me know that now his right lung had collapsed and was going to get the same puncture as his left lung. He continued to remain in the same critical state: 2 collapsed lungs, a high heart rate, low blood pressure, and using the ventilator at its greatest capacity. On November 10 at 5:00pm the nurse on duty called to let me know that my brother was losing his vital signs and that his heart was too weak and he asked if I would authorize him to use ultra shocks on his heart and perform CPR that could potentially break his ribs. In which my response to that was for him to do everything possible to keep him alive. That same nurse suggested a recommendation: that if he was his brother he would let him rest and stop his pain since he had been suffering and no progress had been made. Thank God he wasn’t his brother and that I didn’t listen to him, I wasn’t the one who gave him life much less would I be the person to take it away. That same night at around 8:15pm the doctor called to let me know the same thing; that my brother had been on the ventilator for so long and had made no improvement. My faith and hope towards God was massive that I decided to block what the doctor had just said and replied with, “Doctor please just save my brother’s life and do your job while I do mine which is to pray and ask God to guide you, your hands and knowledge in order for you to save his life”. The next day he was assigned to a new nurse who we surely believe was an angel sent by God himself. This nurse granted us to finally see the light among the darkness, and restored our faith and hope. She single handedly started removing the sedation medications by “playing” with them so that neither his heart or blood pressure would get out of control. November 13 was the day that we had anticipated for so long… he WOKE up and gained some recognition. Imagine if I had listened to the nurse’s suggestion and allowed for them to disconnect him. I thank God for never letting that fight in me disappear, for letting me understand and comprehend that His time is perfect. After 92 days, on November 24, my brother stopped using the ventilator completely and only started using the wall oxygen. He lost mobility in his body due to him being in a long induced coma and being under temporary paralysis medication for a total of 13 days. On November 27, the tube that was first punctured on his left lung was removed. On December 2, my brother was still struggling to breathe and once he had a catscan it was discovered that pneumonia was still present on his right lung and the doctor recommended for him to continue under ICU. Finally on December 9, the tracheal tube was removed and in addition, his blood analysis together with his oxygen levels seemed to be on the right track. He was transferred to a second rehabilitation center on December 14 where he would be acquiring physical therapy and till this day, December 29, he is still hospitalized and fighting this battle, getting the necessary means for him to walk again soon and gain the mobility he lost in these almost 4 months. Which is why I am here today asking for everyone’s help in keeping him in your prayers for a full and fast recovery and above all to help us with this fundraiser in order to support my brother’s hospital and clinical expenses. My brother has been out of work for 4 months and without sustaining any pay. Sadly, the bills keep coming in and accumulating which are necessary for him to continue his therapies and eventually proceed at home by accommodating essential needs such as his bed, restroom, etc. Donations made to Raul’s cause will go directly to medical expenses, additional bills, and support for his family while we navigate this difficult time. I want everyone to know that he is a fighter and has proven this endless amount of times, so much love and support has been shown to our family and from the bottom of our hearts we thank you.-With gratitude, Nena.Read more"

She’s been one of my closest friends for 24 years, a 33 year old Columbia River Gorge local. This amazing woman helped my kids and I get through a very tough chapter years ago. She’s just a wonderful person overall. ❤️Unfortunately, while caring for others in her workplace, she caught Covid-19. She ended up very sick, requiring intubation twice, 25 days in the hospital followed by an 8 day rehab stay before being able to return home, being cared for by her husband Vid. She continues to require physical therapy to regain strength; still currently too weak to return to work. Adriana has always been very dedicated to her job, being the main source of income for her family for many years. The impact of her being ill so much this year has devastated her family’s finances. After hearing she and her husband are worried about a loss of housing, I asked if we could set up a Go Fund Me. Adriana is not one to ask for help; she very reluctantly agreed - so here we are! As if Covid wasn’t financially devastating enough, Adriana required 5 other hospital stays in 2020 for various reasons, including pancreatitis and a bone infection requiring her to miss extended periods of work and income. At this point Adriana and Vid could use help getting caught back up on rent and bills. We would really appreciate any and all help, whether it be a share of this post, $1 or another donation. It all makes a difference! Thank you.Read more"

He has always been very selfless, the kind of guy who took care of everybody else. The friend in the group who would always pick up the bill, the guy who's office you could always go into when you had a problem, the guy who would do sound for your show and never take money no matter how often you tried to pay him.Jim has devoted countless hours at the Canadian American Club in Watertown setting up his own equipment, performing sound checks, running the audio during a wide variety of traditional acoustic music and dance events and then tearing down and securing the equipment, usually for a couple of diet Cokes in remuneration. He has been the legendary sound man for the Club's annual Gala which lasts from noon-8pm and features typically ten separate groups of performers -a marathon of audio wizardry...all with a smile! Unfortunately, Jim suffered some very serious health issues in November 2020, the most serious of which were several strokes, that required a long stay in the hospital and follow up in rehab. Jim is finally coming home in Late February of 2021, but will require 24 / 7 home care (at least at the beginning) as a result of his condition. We hope over time that Jim is able to get better but he can only do this with the proper care and rehabilitation, and unfortunately that is quite expensive. While Jim does have some disability insurance resources, that is not enough to cover the necessary services or resources for his continued recovery while living at home.This is where the GoFundMe comes in. We are asking all of the people who Jim has known, worked with, supported or just helped make their lives better (and those who are touched by his story) to consider supporting this GoFundMe so we can make sure that Jim is able to both stay at home and continue making progress. Let's all show Jim how much he means to us all and help him continue to recover!Jim is going to require 24 hour home care for an unknown amount of time. As of right now Jim will not be returning to work. As you can imagine that kind of thing is very expensive. All of the funds raised by this GoFundMe will go directly to Jim's medical and living expenses.This GoFundMe is run by Lucinda Brandt (friend of Jim's from the Canadian American Club) and Chris Chipman (friend and co-worker of Jim's) with the support of countless others.Read more"

November 7, 2020 UPDATE on Joey!He is getting stronger and stronger every day and getting back to be the Joey we all know. The Houston Chronicle did an article on Joey and his recovery. I have posted the link below. Please read and give Joey a shout out to let him know how super proud we are of him. I wished I could be there on Thanksgiving Day to cheer him over the finish line. His rock Sarah and the kids will be there cheering the loudest!!Our family is so happy to see him recovering and overcoming COVID. He is still not back to work full-time and the financial struggle from COVID is real. Please continue to share his GoFundMe page so we can help him get out of this.Thank you Everyone and I will update with a picture of him crossing that finish line on Thanksgiving!Kristie (Joey’s Lil Sis)Houston Chronicle Article on Joey:https://www.houstonchronicle.com/neighborhood/moco/news/article/Conroe-man-recovering-from-COVID-19-has-5K-goal-15704047.phpSeptember 26, 2020 UPDATE:Sorry for the delay in updating on Joey. Joey is doing better but he has a long ways to go before he is back to the Joey we all know. Thankfully he was able to make it to his daughter McKenzi wedding last weekend. It was a tough trip for him but he would have not missed it for the World. Although he had to wheel her, instead of walk her down the isle, it was a blessing he was able to be there. I was not able to make it to the wedding but from the pictures McKenzi posted she was a gorgeous bride and the wedding was beautiful. My favorite picture was of Joey standing next to her and his beautiful granddaughter (it was a huge accomplishment for him to be able to stand). He is slowly but surely getting the strength back in his legs. He posted a video a few days on Facebook of him walking with his walker. I can not lie, it was very tough for me to watch him walk with the walker (its hard to see my brother like that) but I am super proud of him and it was wonderful to see him up and walking. Another milestone for him was he was able to go to work for a few hours the other day. His goal is to try and go work two or three hours a few times a week because the shop really needs him. He owns his own shop so not working is not an option. Changing his diet, aqua therapy, and Sarah's help is getting him on the road to recovery but he still has a long ways to go. Sarah has been his Angel and our family can not thank her enough for her love and support. Thank you Sarah for all you have done and continue to do for my brother, without you I am not sure where he would be today. Thank you to everyone for their donations - money, medical equipment, time, messages, prayers, and support. Joey and his family are truly thankful to everyone for everything - so THANK YOU! THANK YOU! COVID has hit Joey and his family very hard financially so I ask that everyone please share this gofundme again so we can try and help reach his goal. I live so far away from my brother the gofundme is my way of trying to help him. Joey is the moneymaker in the family and with the stroke he had at the beginning of the year, the government shutdown in March, and then Joey getting hit hard with the COVID he really needs help. If everyone can give $5 or $10 and share, share, share - we can make the goal.THANK YOU!Kristie(Joey's Lil Sis)September 1, 2020 UPDATE:One Step Forward, Two Steps Back! UnfortunatelyJoey is back in the hospital. He had a great weekend celebrating Jace 20th birthday but yesterday he starting running small fever and was not feeling well.  Sarah took him to emergency room and he was admitted back into the hospital.  He has pneumonia and they are waiting on tests to see if anything else is going on. Please pray today all the tests come back normal and he can go back home within a day or so. He is already very upset he is there. Sarah continues to thank everyone so so much for all their kind words, prayers, and love &concern. She would also like to remind everyone to hold your loved ones a little tighter! I would love to get to our goal to help Joey so please keep sharing.Thank you to everyone!Kristie(Joey Lil Sis)August 26, 2020 UPDATE:Joey has been home for 9 days and has made good progress! Even though he's not walkingyet he isgetting stronger everyday. He has a therapist coming into his home on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Friday's to work with him. His legs and feet have been hurting him pretty bad (hoping the pain he is feeling is just from them waking up and getting stronger). He is suppose to start pool therapy tomorrow which will hopefully help him build up the strength in his legs quicker so he can start walking. I hope the pool therapy will workbecausehe has a father's dream event coming up soon (walking his daughter down the isle). Sarah, the kids, and our entire family thanks everyone for the prayers and support. Joey istruly appreciative all the love everyone has shown him. He has a long ways to go still but all we can ask for is the next day be better then the day before. If everyone can keep sharing this, its all I can do for my brother to try and help ease thefinancialburden on him and his family until he can get back to work. Thank you again everyone! Kristie(Joey Lil Sis)August 17, 2020 UPDATE:Joey is on his way home from the hospital this evening which in most cases would be great news. However, its not the case with Joey. The hospital ( Houston Methodist Continuing Care in Katy, Texas) he wastransferredto last Wednesday was doing a horrible job caring for him. I don't usually like to talk bad about places but this hospital and the care they were giving him is pathetic. Sarah has busted her butt off since he was moved there trying to make sure he was on his road to recovery at this new place. She spent hours just trying to get them to answer the phone, drove 3 hour round trips to getanswers and to take him food because hewasn't eating. She spent hours on FaceTime with Joey to make sure he was trying to move his arms and legs as much as he could and to watch him eat to make sure he did not choke. If Joey would have not had his phone she would have not even known this was all happening. IFaceTime Joey last night and it was one of the most emotional conversations I have had with my brother. He was begging the nurse for a bath and to shave him, begging her to sit him up or at least get him up and sit in a chair but she could not. Why? I have no idea. I even spoke to the nurse myself to beg her and got a bs response.  He had not been out of the bed since he arrived on Wednesday and no therapy was given. Joey felt hopeless and when I saw the tears in his eyes I was terrified and heartbroken.Sarah could no longer let him lay in this hospital and beneglected another day.  She went and picked him up today and is going to take care andfigure out a way to make him into the Joey we all know herself. Joey is talking a little better now and is learning to use his phone again. He can not walk and his eye is still swollen but they say the infection is gone, which makes you wonder why his eye isstill swollen?Please pray for Sarah to give her thestrength she needs to now be a wife, a mother, a business owner, and now a care giver.  Everyone's text messages, phone calls, social media shout outs, and support has been a blessing to Joey and Sarah. They still have a long road to recovery and the stress on Joey keeping his business and paying the bills is already in his mind. I ask everyone to continue to share this gofundme. If we could get a thousand shares and every person who has notdonated just donate $5 each we can hit the goal. I have never done agofundme or ever asked for donations but Joey and Sarah really need the help.Sarah deserves the wife of the year award!Many thanks to everyone!!Kristie(Joey Lil Sis)August 12, 2020 UPDATE:  Joey is finally out ofICU and has been moved to a continuing care unit in Katy, Texas. He is still on the weaker side, still on oxygen (they turn it down lil more each day which is good), and he still has infection and onantibiotics(the infection is getting better though).  At this facility he will get one on onecare to help with hisrehabilitation to try and get him back to the Joey we all know. Doctors are still unsure how long he will be in this rehab, they can only take one dayat a time. He does feelalone since this place does not allowvisitors either. Not sure how much or if at all he is looking at facebook right now but if his facebook friends can send him a shout out maybe that will help him feel not so alone.   The prayers are definitely working so please don't stop yet!Kristie(Joey Lil Sis)Sunday August 9, 2020 UPDATE:  Joey had a great day today. He was able toFaceTimewith Sarah, his kids, my sister, and our mom. He was not able to say to much butit was great that he was able to communicate with the Nurses help. He is still in the ICU but hopefully he will transfer tomorrow or the next day to aregular room and start his physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. The nurses told Sarah today that all the praying is working. So once again thank you, thank you everyone for all the prayers and support!SaturdayAugust 8, 2020 UDATE: Joey is completely off the ventilator and breathing on his own now!! He is pretty confused, not knowing where he is and he is very scared. Sarah wishes more then anything she can be there with him by his side, when she knows he needs her the most, but the hospital will not allow her to be. All she can do is wish, hope, and rely on the nurses that are taking care of him thatthey givehim the confidence and the strength he needs to know he is going to be okay.  He still has a long way to go. The infection is still there and we are hoping the new antibiotics he is on will work soon, so they do not have to transfer him to another hospital in downtownHouston. Doctors are unsure at this point how long he will be in the hospital and they are not sure exactly what his recovery plan will be. Just have to take one day at a time and hope he willbe one of the lucky one that has a full and quick recovery from this crazy virus.    Once again, Sarah and all of us can not thank everyone enough for their prayers, phone calls, messages, texts, and support. Joey is truly blessed to have family and friends like you all who have supported him in his greatest time of need. Thank you to EVERYONE!!Kristie (Joey's Lil Sis)

Friday August 7, 2020 UPDATE:  Few hours ago Sarah got a phone call from the hospital and Joey is AWAKE and breathing on his own! He is still unable to talk and still on theventilator forat leastanother 24 hours to make sure he doesn't get tired and not breathing as well as he should be. This is the best news, especially since yesterday was not such good news. Yesterday, he started running fever due to an infection starting in his body. He still has the infection today but a doctor specializing in infections came in this morning and changed his antibiotics, maybe the change is what helped with themiracle this afternoon. The infection is still unknown until they get the labresults back tomorrow.  Joey still has a long ways to go but to get him off theventilator in the next day or two will be prayers answered.   Once again, the family and I can not thank everyoneenough for their prayers and support! I am hoping to reach our goal before he wakes upcompletely, so please keep sharing. I also need to figure out how to change this picture before he wakes up so hedoesn't kill me - so if anyone hasexperiencewith gofundme and can tell me howplease pm. Kristie (Joey's Lis Sis)Hello everyone. Unfortunately, on July 23, 2020 my brother Joey Alvarez was diagnosed with COVID-19. That day he was admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath and low oxygen levels. On July 25th his oxygen levels dropped so low that the doctors had no choice but to put him on a ventilator. We were hoping he would only be on the ventilator for a few days but he is now slowly approaching two weeks on it. We know he is fighting hard to beat this troubling disease for his family whom means everything to him. Most of you know Joey owns his own business and unfortunately he does not have insurance because self-employed insurance is very expensive. He is the main source of income for the family and without him being able to work, the financial stressors are becoming too much for the family right now. We are unsure how much longer Joey will remain in this condition. I know we are in difficult times, but your prayers and any amount of donation you can provide would be a huge help for Joey and his family. Any money donated will be put toward hospital bills, medications, and the family living expenses until Joey can get back to work. Thank you in advance for your prayers and much needed help!

No one could have predicted the devastating chain of events that our beautiful confident friend and her family had ahead of them.On Christmas Eve, the same year we finished school, Sam suffered a small stroke which left half her body without feeling, however being as healthy and happy as Sam was, even the medical professionals weren’t alarmed. Hence it was almost a week later that she was sent for a CT scan, and a contrast dye was used which detected a large cluster of blood vessels that weren’t connected to anything in Sam’s brain. To cut a long story short, probably as a result of the contrast dye being injected (no one can say definitively), the cluster of blood vessels exploded, and Sam suffered a massive CVA that same night of 31st December 1991 while she was under the care of a physician in hospital. She was rushed to North Shore hospital, had surgery and remained in intensive care and hospital for months. From that moment on, Sam would never be able to do anything for herself again. After suffering septicaemia when she had a feeding tube inserted into her stomach, and more surgery, many in the medical profession lost hope for any form of rehabilitation. Nevertheless her family did what they could to send her to a rehab centre where she remained for a few months until she went home late in 1992. Her parents were told they would last a day or 2 looking after her, however they never gave up, and 28 years later Sam still lives with them.Matthew Salmon and I have set up this Go Fund Me page for our beautiful friend Samantha Leacy, with whom we went to high school. Sam is a very close friend to both Matt and I, and the strongest person we know. We are currently both working with Sam to improve her communication through the use of Eye Gazing Technology, which is incredibly promising and exciting as we are able to communicate with her on a level, we have not been able to do for almost 30 years. Through this communication with Sam and the regular interactions with Sam’s friend and carer Lisa Stewart, it became very apparent to us that to get a Wheelchair accessible vehicle to be able to take Sam to a park, or the board walk on a beach, or visit friends and to simply reintroduce spontaneity into Sam’s life again after 28 years would be completely life changing for her.The go fund me support team have asked that I include in this page that I (Lisa Whealy AKA Lisa Tesoriero) will be responsible for withdrawing the funds from the go fund me page, and overseeing the purchase of the vehicle so that all the donors are aware of where their donations are at all times. I am setting up a new account in my name that I will transfer all the funds received from the go fund me page into, so every cent will go to the vehicle for Sam and if we are lucky enough to raise any extra, these funds will all go to vehicle running costs and ongoing medical expenses for Sam.We are more than half way to our goal of $45,000 (however if we raise more we can purchase a newer vehicle for Sam), so please donate to, and share our Go Fund me page - as there is no one more deserving of a break than Sam and her family!!xxRead more"

On our last full beach day, my brother, Eddie (some of you may know him as Trè), was swimming in the ocean and dove into the water. He ended up breaking his C4 vertebrae and herniated his C5 disc. He went into emergency surgery that night and has been in the ICU battling different obstacles like neurological fevers, trouble with his lungs and diaphragm, and healing from this crazy accident.A lot has happened since then and he has made great strides in his recovery. He has gross motor function in his arms and is able to move his right foot. He still has healing to do and improvements to make yet. He will be going to rehab at Magee Rehabilitation Hospital in Philadelphia for a couple of months to go even further in his recovery. Magee is one of the top rehab centers in the nation for spinal cord injuries.We are asking for help to make sure Eddie has access to the best medical care for his recovery. Funds from this GoFundMe will go straight to medical and health care expenses for Eddie and anything he needs to recover. From covering the cost of his apartment and expenses there, to rehab costs and whatever equipment and physical and occupational therapy he needs during his recovery process, which will likely be over the next year or two.We aren’t sure where he will be or what he will need in the future, but we want to make sure finances don’t stop him from the best recovery possible.If you know Eddie, you know he is an athlete at heart and has so much dedication for anything he puts his mind to. Growing up he played basketball, football, and baseball. He is such a talented baseball player and had played for Marietta College and most recently for the UC Clermont Cougars. He has such a blast with his teammates and has a great love for the game.Eddie is set on walking again one day and we are supporting him with anything we possibly can. He is one of the strongest people I know.We are so amazed at the support we have received from everyone and are so thankful. My parents are reading all of Eddie’s texts and messages from his phone and he is absolutely beyond proud to see the love and support he is receiving. Please keep kind messages, prayers, positive thoughts, good vibes, and everything in between coming.Read more"

In this case, it’s true. Let me tell you about my hero. He’s a hero to many. He goes by the name of Tree or Louie. I’m Jim and he is my youngest brother.On July 13, 2020 Louis “Tree” Triana was at a friend’s house helping with a project and suffered a spinal cord injury at level C4 and C5, along with lung damage from being submerged in water. He is paralyzed from the chest down and is on a ventilator. He’s working hard in rehab to regain the ability to breathe again and hopes to be able to regain the use of his arms and hopefully his legs. Tree has a daughter, Tiffany and grandson Avery who live in Arkansas. With his wife, Jill, of 20 years they have three amazing teen kids: Aubrie, Emily & Dylan. Tree is an avid outdoorsman and looks forward to being back at home, gracing everyone with his witty and sometimes sarcastic sense of humor. Tree is a veteran and is proud of his military background. Petty Officer Triana served his country with the Navy for nearly 10 years. Tree's commitment to our country was noted when he was working as a medic alongside the Marines for Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. Later, as a civilian, Tree went to work in the medical field. Today, he works at an area hospital and looks forward to the day he will return to work.Due to COVID-19, he is not able to have his family by his side. Some of the normal actions which assist in healing, such as loving touch and constant words of encouragement are just not possible, as he is alone.Please consider donating to him and his beautiful family. The future is uncertain, but they do know there will be major modifications to their home, a handicap-accessible vehicle, aides, and numerous medical expenses and devices. Although he has suffered a near-fatal accident and a life-changing event, he remains a pillar of hope to his friends and family and his spirit is strong. There are many things he wants to do, and even wants to get what he calls a 4-wheel drive wheelchair so he can enjoy the outdoors with his family. Please help support Tree on his road to recovery.

Dan, Danny, Dapper Dan.After suffering symptoms for some time, Dan recently found out the news that he had a slow growing brain tumor. Fortunately, tests determined it was benign, however they knew the location and size was going to be a challenge to remove.

On October 13, Dan went in for surgery to remove the tumor. The road ahead has been rocky. Dan has hit so many bumps in the road and has had countless complications.

The amazing thing though...his strength! His family and friends (and even strangers) have been praying and praying. If we didn’t realize Dan’s strength before all this, well we do now! He’s a fighter!

Those countless complications have kept him in the ICU at Brigham and Women’s Hospital for the last 4 weeks. He has an uphill road to recovery ahead of him. We are hopeful he will be heading to rehab soon and will keep everyone updated.In the meantime, Michelle is holding down the fort with unbelievable strength and courage. Staying positive for Meredith (5 years) and Mackenzie (10 years) and working throughout all of this.

Let’s help out the family and Dan as he heads to rehab and eventually back on the streets with the SPD!

Anything helps. Prayers, too. Thank you all. Lots of love ❤️

Willie worked on the State Department's Diplomatic Security Contract in Iraq, Afghanistan, and most recently Israel as a medic for almost ten years. Prior to that he was a flight medic, swat medic, and paramedic for many years. The brief synopsis of his injuries are a central core spinal contusion, two crushed vertebrae, a broken neck, and a torn rotator cuff. The torn rotator cuff happened during rescue efforts to save Willie. He was medically evacuated from Israel, to Germany, and then on to the US, finally ending up in Shepard Spinal Rehab Center in Atlanta, Georgia to begin what is sure to be a very long rehab process. He's already been through one surgery, with more to follow. He is unable to move at all below the neck, and has to use a stylus in his mouth to answer his phone, call for assistance, or respond to emails. He is a fighter and is making gains daily but he needs 24x7 care, and will for some time. The doctors are saying it is too early to know what recovery he will be able to make.

Yesterday, my BIL Ralph was traveling on his motorcycle down Highway 28 headed to meet people for lunch. While proceeding past Union, two people in a truck, after stopping at the stop sign, somehow missed seeing his neon motorcycle and t-boned him in the process. I am unsure how fast they were going, but managed to hit him hard enough to break his back, several ribs, and damage his left leg irretrievably. Although they wanted to airlift him to El Paso for surgery, he had lost too much blood, and they had to make the very tough decision to amputate his left leg (past the knee). He will be waking up to a very different reality. For any of you that know Ralph, you will agree with me in that he is a larger than life person who has a twisted sense of humor and no “indoor voice” whatsoever. He loves his family, did charity bike runs often, and has dedicated 21 years of his life to driving a truck across I believe 45+ states of this beautiful country. These are all qualities I love about him. With what has happened, his life will change drastically at least for the foreseeable future. The doctors are estimating at least 6-8 months of rehab, once he is out of the hospital. This, however, hasn’t been the only trial they have been through recently. Kellie has battled some health scares recently, from trigeminal neuralgia to breast cancer. Kellie is currently a year in remission for breast cancer. They’ve made it through these horrible situations with as much positivity as they could muster.Their current circumstance is going to take so much more. My goal with this gofundme is to give them a chance to breathe while they figure out their next steps. Whether Ralph will be able to drive his truck again isn’t something that can even be determined right now. He has many months of rehab coming and they are in need of a workable solution right now. Anything you can donate will help. If you are unable to, please send prayers and positive thoughts as everything helps.Read more"

Hey guys and gals, as some of you may or may not be aware my best friend recently had a severe stroke at the young age of only 21!

This past week has been extremely hard on his family and close friends. Stanley is currently at the Royal Prince Alfred hospital in Sydney undergoing scans and tests to try and find the underlying cause of his stroke.His family have dropped everything to make their way to Sydney to be able to support him through this time and they’ll be there for him through his road to recovery — like myself and his other close friends.Stanley has a great deal of social support around him at this current time which is awesome, but unfortunately it’s taken and will continue to take a financial toll on himself and his family due the inevitable ongoing costs of transportation and eventually rehab among other things.For every $2 I can raise I will complete a burpee, i.e; $10 donated = 5 burpees. I’m going to give myself a 60 minute time cap and for every rep that I don’t complete I will match it with my own money meaning that if I have 50 burpees left to go when the time runs out I will donate $100 to this cause.This couldn’t have happened to a more kind and caring person and it’s completely devastating to everyone but I’m willing to put myself in the pain cave for a bit to help a brother as it’s nothing compared to what he’s going through.I understand that times are tough right now financially for some people but if you can find a few spare dollars to donate it’ll go a long way.I’ll be completing the burpees from all the money raised on the 1st of June so hopefully we can get a bit of money in and everyone can watch me suffer for a good cause.

Thankfully it was a day off school for her & my sister was home from work. Wendy was down stairs & heard an odd noise above her. Shortly afterwards she heard a strange crying sound. She went upstairs & found Chelsea laying on the floor contorted, looking like she was having a seizure. The ambulance came & within a short time Chelsea was in the Vernon hospital where they realized it was a life threatening stroke & not a seizure. Her condition was so serious there was not enough time to airlift her to Vancouver so she was transferred to Kelowna. She was unresponsive when she arrived & was immediately whisked into surgery. The Neurosurgeon was unable to get all of the clot but Heparin did its job & stopped its growth so her body could dissolve it. Miraculously Chelsea is almost back to perfect health physically but has a long road to go to reach full mental healing. Cognitively she ranges from toddler to teenager & thus it is not safe to her leave her alone. Wendy is having to stay at the hospital with her & due to the Covid shut down is wary of leaving in case they don’t let her back in. Chelsea is struggling with finding the right words for things but is improving with determination & the help of 2 speech therapists. She is also suffering from CPSP - Central Post Stroke Pain - in her right forearm and hand. It is very hard to manage and is a huge concern as it can be detrimental to her recovery. She is starting medication but it will be a number of days before we know if it is helping. Because of her age Chelsea isn't eligible for any of the adult stroke programs and there are no paediatric ones for her to access. So there will likely be a lot of out of pocket expenses to make sure she gets the best rehab possible. Wendy will be doing most of that work with her, following whatever program the Kelowna rehab centre sets out. She will also be helping her with online schooling because Chelsea is determined to graduate on time even though she can’t go back to school yet. These changes will be very hard on what has always been a 2 income household. I am asking anyone who can to please donate to help with extra expenses as Chelsea goes through these various stages of therapy and as my sister & her fiancé make the needed adjustments to their home to make it safe for her. They will need help to cover the rehab as well as regular life expenses & potentially may need to hire some help so Wendy & Josh can take a break to help maintain their sanity.If you can’t give money positive thoughts & prayers for this family of 5 are greatly appreciated. We also appreciate you sharing this with your friends. Chelsea is extremely precious to us, she is our original “summer horse girl” & owns a huge part of my heart! She is full of hopes & dreams for the future & they include a lot of talking so she is determined to improve!Any help you can give will help this motivated, stubborn & talented teenager move towards her goals of graduation & independence will be greatly appreciated.

While Rhys was out working in the woods with his crew, something that he has done a million of times before and loves to do, a tree fell and hit him at a high impact. Rhys was airlifted to St. Louis University Hospital suffering 4 crushed vertebrae, 3 fractures to his jaw, and a broken arm. Since his arrival to the ICU Rhys has undergone three different surgeries, spinal surgery being the most extensive, resulting in 6 of his vertebrae to be fused. Unfortunately, the damage and pressure to his spinal cord caused the loss of mobility in his legs. Rhys has ALWAYS been a fighter - someone who turned his life around and made the best out of every situation, building up others as much as himself along the way. This is the time that we need to show him that he matters to us just as much as we mean to him. He has a long recovery ahead and it'll take an army. This transition is going to include intensive rehabilitation with the hopes of regaining partial movement in his legs. The last thing we want is to make him feel like he cannot continue to do the things he loves. Rhys has lived a very mobile life, from traveling, playing sports (one of the best baseball players I know), playing with his niece and nephews, to his two jobs that require intense physical labor (roofing and working in the woods). That being said, Rhys will need to get fitted for a wheelchair, one that will allow him to be as active as possible, as well as other equipment to make his life at home more accessible. By donating to Rhys' recovery you will not only be supporting his physical health transformation, helping subside current medical costs as well as the medical needs that come with a loss of mobility (wheelchair, rehab, future surgery...), but also his mental health to overcome this hardship.The loss of Rhys' mobility means that he will be unable to work while he is in the process of rehab, and most likely unable to return to his exact position. This means that all donations will help the daunting medical costs that are adding up and help take some of the hardship off his shoulders.Both Rhys and his family appreciate any and all donations that can be made.There is a long battle ahead and we ask that whether you can donate or not, please keep Rhys in your thoughts and prayers while he starts the healing process.

I was hoping it would change but it did not and I have not received a salary since February. I was forced to return to the UK, to try and find a paid income.This meant I had to leave my beautiful little girl behind. I was heart broken , I feel that a piece of my world is missing. I desperately want to bring her back to me where she belongs with her daddy.I adopted Duchess when she was 6 weeks old. A client that was coming in to the rehab bought her with her.Of course she could not keep her , so I adopted her.She became my world,' it was me and Duchess against the world', that is what I used to say. I lived in the country side which at times could be lonely but with little Duchess, I never really felt lonely because she was always at my side.On the weekend we would go on road trips.Duchess loved being on the motorbike with me , she would come with me wherever I went, whether that be to the barbers, a remote cafe or just a drive up to the mountains. We were inseparable .I could not leave her for more than a hour or two by her self, I would feel so guilty.My friend would always ""say she is a dog they have no memory of time"", to me she was always more than a dog, she was my pal and my little animal soul mate.I am raising money help bring Duchess home to the UK, that will take approximately 3 months which means that Duchess will be home with me in time for Christmas.Unfortunately not having had a salary for 7 months all my saving have gone. I am presently looking for work in London ,this will hopefully happen in the next month.I am literately starting my life from scratch. This means also finding a new home for me and duchess to settle in. With out the go fund me page it would take months for me to save enough money to get my little girl home, I feel heart broken with out her.

It does."" - William JamesA very beloved family in our community is needing our help. I am reaching out to all of you in the hope of helping this family through a difficult time in their lives.Almost two weeks ago, a friend to many, Steve Freeman, had a stroke; thank goodness, he is going to be okay. At this time, he is out of ICU, and at a rehab center. Steve is hoping to be able to go home soon, but will be returning for on-going outpatient therapies. He will also be seeing a Neuro Ophthalmologist before he will be able to drive again. They have not been given any timeline of when Steve will be able to return to work. As many of you know, Kathy has not been able to go back to work herself because of a medical emergency last year. When it rains - it pours!On a happier note, Steve, his sweet wife Kathy, and their amazing daughters, Alexis and Dominque, all continue to have their beautiful hearts and smiles. They continue to shine their bright light wherever they go - even at the rehab center! This is a family that is always there for everyone else. They are givers to our community in more ways than can be mentioned. They have been a huge presence in the disability community since their daughter, Dominique, was born nearly twenty-one years ago. They have been to, and spoken at, many conferences, forums, boards, university classes, etc. to be a voice, and advocate for people with disabilities when the rest of us have not been able to participate as much as we'd like. I could go on, and on, and on.... Our community is blessed because of the Freeman Family.Whatever is gifted to them will help them with keeping up with paying all the bills - medical co-pays, deductibles, mortgage payment, transportation, etc. Any and all monetary donations will no doubt make a difference! Let's lift them up in positive thoughts, prayer, love and support. If you are able to gift them with a donation - I know it will be very much appreciated. From the bottom of our hearts - thank you!Feel free to share this to your Facebook page if you'd like. Also, if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.Read more"

Tim is home and focused on keeping positive and healthy. It will be a journey we will all walk together. Love to all-UPDATE - 7/14/20We are truly overwhelmed by the outpouring of support, love and encouragement from so many, near and far. Many of you have asked for more information about Tim’s condition:He has suffered some setbacks since arriving at Spaulding. The current plan is for Tim to stay there until at least August 14th in order to continue with his physical and occupational therapy. He continues to build his skills and strength with the determination we are all used to. In the meantime, we are working hard to make the home safe, accessible and livable for his return.Thank you so much to everyone for their generosity, it means so much to Tim, Beth, Charlie and their family.7/8/20Our dear friend Tim Watkins had a terrible accident on June 9 that has left him paralyzed from the waist down. Tim is working hard in Spaulding Rehab Hospital (where he will be for close to two months) learning the skills he needs to live his life as a paraplegic and recovering from his severe injury.Some of you know him from cycling, which has been a central focus of his life and has taken him all over the world; from his work imagining and producing a range of carpentry and construction projects; from growing up in the South End, where the Watkins family was deeply rooted for decades; or from the rich circle of friends he and his wife Beth Anderson have formed over the years. However you came to be in Tim’s world, you know the determination, perseverance, and sense of humor he brings to everything he does. He is drawing on all of these strengths more than ever, and he and his family need our help.In addition to the ongoing expenses of medical care and physical therapy, Tim and Beth’s Dorchester home will require a ramp and other modifications for accessibility. Tim will need custom wheelchairs in order to maintain the active life so central to his well-being, and he will need a specialized vehicle to allow him to continue to travel near and far. Tim, Beth, and their son Charlie are beloved by all of us, and our support for them at this devastating time will go a long way to bring them comfort and alleviate the stress of their sudden financial demands.As Tim continues to heal, he will begin the hard work to not only adapt to his circumstances, but also to reimagine a new and unforeseen phase of his career and his life. We know that his physical, emotional, and intellectual strength and resilience will serve him well. Please help us to do everything we can to support him going forward.Read more"

By the pure grace of God it has lasted them until this month. Their story is complex but let me give the Cliff Notes version...Adam and Karen were blessed with two biological children. Their second son was diagnosed as terminal as a toddler. He lived an amazing 3.5 years. The family wanted to give another child that same life and regrow their family via adoption. They initially only intended to adopt one, but their eyes were opened to the massive need and they promised each other that they would fill their original accessible van to capacity, and they did! Life was amazing as they adopted 4 additional kids over the years. Four years ago tragically their 7 year old escaped the house and drown in the backyard retention pond. Karen found him but couldn’t revive him. Karen struggled with an eating disorder for her entire life but after Jayden died, the trauma, the PTSD, it all came back with a vengeance. For Karen she wants people to know it’s not about being thin, It’s about being the only way she could cope with the death of her two children. She became very ill this spring. They made end of life plans, but She started fighting harder than ever. Just as She began rehab to regain her strength She was hit with a bilateral stroke. A right cerebellum and left cerebral to be exact. It’s has changed their lives yet again.As for a new van, these new additional needs change everything. The cost for an accessible van is typically unachievable for most families, but adding on the new features they need is life altering and huge financial blow to this family.They are not looking for people to buy them a van, but are looking for help with the down payment to make the payments semi-reasonable.Read more"

As most of you would know, it's been just overa year since Tets passed away. His family, military family and vast group of friends and acquaintances all miss him. This round of fundraising is in an attempt to reach a total of $25,000 raised. No amount of money can ever replace a loved one but every bit raised goes directly towards the Tetley family as they continue to rebuild and strengthen their life after the loss of Wayne. I will be attempting another long trek as a fundraiser for the family. The route is ~58km through the Mt. Lofty ranges this weekend (14 April)http://trailrunningsa.com/five-peaks-sa-trail-running-festival/Thank-you for not only reading and but also, thank-you for supporting this worthy cause for such an awesome guy. He is sorely missed by his Maritime Patrol fraternity. Wish me luck.All the best, GG________Early December 2016 - a good friend and workmate whom I have knownfor over 25 years suffereda serious and massive stroke. His name is Wayne Tetley or, as our aviation community knows him simply as - ""Tets""Tets had just returned from 6-months overseas where he was training in the USA. He had been home just a week when the stroke occurred.Tetswas in ICU and was not expected to live. He was completely incapacitated and on life support, everyoneprepared for the worst possible outcome. He pulled through .......and began a partial road to recovery. His tenacity is only matched by the love and support of his family, friends and his extended military family. Tets began to blink, smile and move his head over time. Additionally he began some partial movements in his hands. Eventually he was able to laugh, cry and began making sounds as he attempted to communicate. Preprations were made to transfer him from hospital to a brain injury rehab unit with the eventual aim of transferring him home.Then disaster struck, again. On 2 March 2017, Tets suffered another arterial bleed that set him back further than before. He is in and out of consciousness and again, the family have been told to prepare for the worst.I want to help the family and Tets. Medical is covered by his military service, but this severe illness is taking it's toll on the family. So many scenarios play out based on the uncharted medical territory that Tets is currently in. Schooling for his children, care for his dear and lovely mother. Family home and upkeep. Transport to and from the hospital, car parking fees and a life turned upside down and in limbo waiting and hoping for the best. You name it, there is a little bit of help needed everywhere.To help Tets - I plan on...trekking/running/walking/crawling (if I have to) 65km (40 miles) along the South Australian coast. I seek your sponsorship of every mile or km I complete.The trek, well it's an organised event. But I'm not. I have done little to no preparation. I am hoping to try and match the tenacity and mental fortitude of Tets in completing the event. It's happening in under three weeks (26 March) and I am banking on seeing Tets when I finish. Another thing I am banking on, your support. Please consider sponsoring me for a modest amount per km(mile) finished.Thank-you.GGRead more"

Codey sustained a torn aorta, a collapsed lung, a broken femur, and bruised his kidney and spleen; but what you may not know is while trapped in his car Codey lost blood flow to the lower portion of his spine ""Codey currently has no feelings in his lower legs"" the doctors inserted a lower lumbar drain to relieve any excess fluid and pressure, they are running as many tests as they are able to but unfortunately no one knows if it's permanent or if he will ever regain feeling, we are optimistic but even if he does regain feeling it's going to be a long painful road to recovery.Codey has always been a hard worker and has always tried his hardest to do the best he absolutely could for himself and anyone around him. Codey is a brilliant young man who loved to work with his hands, he held a job in the trade industry all of his life as a detailer or flooring installer. According to his doctors Codey will not be returning to work in the near future and unfortunately as with many Americans have suffered this year Codey too does not have any savings and unfortunately the bills keep coming. The medical bills are going to be astronomical, with multiple surgeries, tests, teams of doctors, the costs for rehabilitation, and looking for long term care are all major expenses a young man or his family never thinks he would ever need. Our goal is a small portion of the expenses that he is currently accruing. Although we are hopeful Codey will heal quickly we also know this is going to be physically, mentally and financially challenging, medical expenses will be a never ending story.We were advised by Codey's case manager that due to his lack of health insurance it will be extremely challenging to find him a rehab center that will be able and willing to care for him without some sort of payment arrangement that Codey nor his family can afford on their own. We need immediate help to provide Codey with the best chance at recovering and living the life that was abruptly interrupted.Codey is a strong, driven, independent, loving, mommas boy who would give anyone the shirt off his back. He has always gone above and beyond for anyone. He gave his all and put his heart and soul into everything he did. If you knew Codey you knew he is a brave soul who spoke his mind with kindness and compassion. If you can donate please do, if you can't please keep him in your thoughts. If you can take a moment and share his story. Please stay positive because he'll need that. If you pray say one for him and his family, it's been tough on us all. We appreciate you and the positive vibes.From the bottom of our hearts thank you, thank you God for letting him stay with us another day.Read more"

When he arrived his oxygen levels were at 75. They immediately put him on a ventalator. Although he had 2 negative Covid-19 tests, they said he was fighting Covid Pneumonia. They put him in ICU Covid Unit and for a week we were unable to see him. They finally moved him out of the Covid side and allowed 1 visitor per day. The Doctors did not know what was going on and could not give us a diagnosis. He ran a fever and everytime we thought he was getting better, he would take a turn for the worse.On January 30th, they took him of the ventalator (Praise God). They said it would take a while before he would be able to move due to all of the sedation they had given him over the 12 days he was on the vent. After 2 days they moved him out of ICU, but he was making no progress with moving his hands, arms, legs or feet. He had CT scans and MRIs and everything came back negative. Every test they ran, came back negative. He remained on oxygen and was having PT and OT.The Neurologist ordered a spinal tap and we finally got a diagnosis - Guillian Barre Syndrome. This is an auto-immune disease that attacked his nerves and it came from the Pneumonia. They immediatly began him on medication and started plasmapheresis treatments every other day. What a difference that has made. He has started to move his legs and arms and is beginning to move his fingers. But he is battlng high blood pressure which could be from the Guillian Barre, so they are limiting his PT for now.Kris has now been in the hospital for 4 weeks. He will remain in the hospital for at least another week. When they discharge him from the hospital he will move to a rehab facility where he could be there for at least 4-6 weeks if not longer.Kristopher is only 28 years old. He and Nichole have 2 boys ages 5 and 16 months. They miss their daddy very much. With Kris in the hospital, they have lost his monthly income but the bills still need to be paid. He does have medical insurance, but after a month already in the hospital and looking at another couple of months in the hospiatl/rehab they will need money to pay those medical costs.Many people have prayed for him, and we see the prayers working. Many have asked how they can help. If you feel lead to make a donation to help with the medical expenses, it would be greatly appreciated.We will keep you updated on his progress. Thank you for prayers and donations.Read more"
